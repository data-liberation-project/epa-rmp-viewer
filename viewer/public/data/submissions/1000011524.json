To ensure the safe operation of our ammonia processes, SSI has complied with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Title 29 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 1910.119, EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP) Title 40 CFR Part 68, and ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems. \n\nThe plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1) To save lives.\n2) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3) To protect the environment.\n4) To minimize property damage.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nSSI Foods Service L.L.C. processes fresh meat products and uses anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems for freeze tunnels, storage, and plant cooling.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the facility is 82,000 pounds.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program in general starts with good operating and manufacturing practices.  All ammonia process equipment, piping, and valves are inspected on a regular schedule depending on manufacturer and industry recommendations.  For example; all compressors are inspected on a monthly basis for oil leaks, pressure and temperature gauge calibrations, vibration analysis, oil pressure, and amp reading for motors;  alignment of compressor motor and compressor, filter change, vibrating readings and sensor calibrations are performed every 6 months;  the condenser 24 point air purger system is inspected weekly (this includes checking and cleaning nozzles and strainers),  motors are greased, fans are checked for cracks, and piping is inspected for leaks;  low and intermediate pressure receiver oil pots are drained, pump pressure is recorded and pumps and valves are defrosted for excessive ice build up weekly;  visual inspection for equipment and vessel operating limit conditions, piping and valves are assessed"

The SSI Food Service facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and ANSI/IIAR 2-1992, which specifically outline requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  Safety features include ammonia sensors in the machinery room, continuous ventilation, microprocessor controlled compressor safeties, 250 psig rated storage vessels, and emergency stop controls.  The majority of the ammonia inventory is centrally located inside the machine room.  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves (that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation to protect the vessel's integrity) that discharge to a common header that is monitored by an ammonia sensor. \n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases (with exception of the normal automatic purging operation that removes air from the system).  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past five years there have been no reportable releases of ammonia.  However, a leak occurred at the facility in December 2007 that resulted in a full plant evacuation (ref. NRC #858227).  Fifteen (15) employees were monitored for minor inhalation exposure, but no significant injuries resulted.  It was later determined that approximately 18 pounds of ammonia was released near the employee evacuation route.\n\n\nContinued improvement for the ammonia refrigeration systems is a top priority for SSI Food Services LLC.

The Emergency Response Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility. On-site personnel have been trained and are qualified to respond aggressively to isolate and control a release.  Equipment such as self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), respirators, serivex body suits, encapsulated level A suits, gloves, boots, and personal leak monitors are available for the emergency response team (ERT).\n\nSSI coordinates emergency response efforts with the local fire department(s) and the area HazMat Response Team as responding agency's scheduling permits.\n\nGeneral production and office employees are also trained in evacuation procedures including the cause to evacuate (alarm or verbal command), and the area(s) that are designated for evacuation assembly.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment. Compliance Audits and a PHA Revalidation studies have generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility. These include enhancing employee training policies, revising standard operating procedures, improving documentation and recordkeeping, and updating preventative maintenance policies. SSI Food Services is proceeding with the few remaining mitigation measures associated with these studies.\n\nCorporate representatives also provide guidance and assistance for the facility personnel to ensure outstanding issues are resolved and that the facility remains in compliance.\nIn addition, the facility is planning to complete the following items over the next yea"

Ammonia leak detectors are located in the machinery room and above condensers (at the pressure relief header exhaust discharge) that trigger local audible and visual alarms.  Machinery room ventilation systems operate continuously and are sized for heat removal exhaust rates which exceed the emergency exhaust requirements.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration, programs have been developed to prevent the occurrence of a release and or minimize the consequences of a significant release of anhydrous ammonia, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Programs developed for the PSM/RM plan include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, training, management of change, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, contractor qualifications, and incident investigation.  To help coordinate the plan, a management program has been established as well as an internal audit program which will help identify compliance status and possible deficiencies in the program.  In the event of a toxic release, an emergency response plan coordinated with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), rural fire department and trained company personnel has been written and implemented.  The ultimate goal for SSI's PSM/RM plan is to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries / illnesses, and to avoid physical damage to the environment.  These programs enable our facility to operate a refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern the industry.\n\nThe SSI Food Service ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.
