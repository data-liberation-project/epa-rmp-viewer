If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release. The Dixon Facility carries the US EPA Facility Identifier number 100-000-028793.\n\n\nES\u00962.0 | FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. Applicable NAICS codes for this facility include 42491 (Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers) and 325311 (Nitrogenous Fertilizer Manufacturing).\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n*-Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is received, converted, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients. \n\n*-Anhydrous ammonia is converted to aqua ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) and reacted with super phosphoric acid (SPA) to produce ammonium phosphate [10-34-0] fertilizer).\n\n*-Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in either an 18,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) or a 30,050-gallon storage tank.\n\n*-The anhydrous ammonia storage vessels are filled to no more than 85% of shell volume. \n\n= > Bullet 1 | 18,000 gals (Cap.); 15,300 gals (Max. amt); 78,642 lbs (Mass NH3)\n\n= > Bullet 2 | 30,050 gals (Cap.); 25,542 gals (Max. amt); 131,286 lbs (Mass NH3)\n\n= > Totals | 48,050 gals (Cap.); 40,842 gals (Max. amt); 209,928 lbs (Mass"

The maximum amount of ammonia (as NH3) in the aqua solution is 58,275 lbs.\n\n\nES\u00963.0 | ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION: \nThe Facility ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees.\n\nHAZARD REVIEW:\nA hazard review of the ammonia processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes. A review of the results from the most recent hazard review update for the anhydrous ammonia process, aqua ammonia process, and pesticide handling and storage indicate that no high-risk hazards were identified through the hazard review updates.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES:\nWritten operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed. The operating procedures are reviewed and recertified on an annual basis. Revisions and improvements occur as needed. \n\nTRAINING:\nFacility staff, as well as Grow West corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an esse"

Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification.\n4. Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\n5. Training records for each employee.\n\nMAINTENANCE AND MECHANICAL INTEGRITY:\nThe maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE:\nOperation, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The Facility Management of Change (MOC) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures.\n\nPRE-START-UP SAFETY REVIEW:\nThe pre-start-up safety review (PSSR) applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated. Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-start-up safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the MOC review. Additionally, a pre-start-up safety review is performed in conjunction with the MOC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:\nPeriodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written RMP must be conducted every three years. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:\nAlthough no incidents inv"

The Facility has an Employee Participation Program in place and has implemented procedures regarding engaging employees for their input, as well as ensuring access to safety documentation to ensure consideration of their knowledge and experience in all applicable areas of the prevention program. \n\nHOT WORK PERMIT:\nWith regard to hot work that may occur on or near the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, Grow West has developed a written Hot Work Permit program and procedure to document the evaluation of the fire prevention and protection requirements. \n\nCONTRACTOR SAFETY:\nThe contractors used by the Facility for anhydrous ammonia delivery have been informed regarding the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to delivery of anhydrous ammonia to the Facility. The Facility has confirmed that the delivery contractors have provided the appropriate training to their drivers regarding the delivery of anhydrous ammonia. The Facility also qualifies contractors who are engaged in maintaining the RS systems to ensure that equipment is modified or repaired and returned to service safely.\n\nOTHER CODE APPLICABILITY:\nThe Facility implements the provisions of the following guidelines, regulations, and standards for these regulated substances (partial list):\n\nRegulated Substances\n\u0095 United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.38, Employee emergency response plan and fire prevention plans. \n\u0095 United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter C, Part 68, Subpart E, Emergency"
