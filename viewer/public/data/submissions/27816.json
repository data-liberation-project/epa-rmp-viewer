The worst case from Plants 1 and 3 had less downwind impact than Plant 3, and therefore, Plant 3 was deemed the worst case for the facility.  This release is the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel - 31,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  The high pressure receiver in Plant 3 is not enclosed and therefore passive mitigation measures can not be taken into account.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The EPA RMP Ammonia Refrigeration Guidance Document look-up tables was used to determine the downwind distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScen"

      "SummaryText": "ario Description: A release of ammonia gas from 1/4 inch diameter leak was reviewed for each Plant. Due to the similarity in the plants, the same scenario was done at each process.  It is assumed that this release is from the high side of the system, therefore, a maximum pressure of 180 psig.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 100 pounds per minute.  No passive mitigation measures were considered becuase the ammonia system is located outside and not enclosed by a building.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability class.  The EPA RMP Ammonia Refrigeration Guidance document look up tables was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRobert Mondavi Winery has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of ammonia.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred at the Robert Mondavi Winery facility in the last five years (March 1998 to March 2003). \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nRobert Mondavi Winery has an emergency response plan for the facility.  If a release of ammonia were to occur, the facility will determine the extent of the emergency.   Supervisors will contact employees in their department to shut off equipment and evacuate to the designated meeting areas.   Plant management will call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department HazMat team who will"

This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the Robert Mondavi Winery.   The PHA was comprised of two sessions that included a HAZOP study, a Plant Walkthrough, a What-if analysis, and a series of checklists.  All mitigation measures are expected to be complete by June 2000.  The following recommendations were made as a result of this Program:\n\n*RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED*\n\nConsider feasibility of remotely shutting down the compressors (i.e. remote emergency shut down switch or power source) and ensure that this procedure is included in the emergency response program.\n\nEnsure that employee training includes alerting maintenance personnel in the event of an ammonia leak.\n\nInclude in the Mechanical Integrity program to change relief valves that vent to atmosphere every five years.\n\nFormalize the equipment inspection program to include a visual inspection of the thermosyphon receiver and documentation of the daily, weekly, monthly, etc. inspections. \n\nEnsure 10 minute escape masks are readily available for maintenance personnel.\n\nConsider using the existing alarm system (fire/burglar) for evacuation purposes.  Also conduct a test/drill to ensure that this alarm can be heard throughout the facility.\n\nInclude in the Mechanical Integrity program a daily log sheet.  This documentation will allow checks for any variations in equipment (Note: The facility is investigating using a computer system to log this data.)\n\nInclude in the Mechanical Integrity program to test the high level alarm and shut down switches on an annual basis.\n\nInclude an oil draining procedure in the Operating Procedures section to assure operator safety while per"

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nRobert Mondavi Winery has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)To minimize property damage.\n\nRobert Mondavi Winery maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly locations, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and Cal-ARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility has been in operation since 1978.  Changes/modifications have taken place since the completion of the facility.  The ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Building Code, and the Uniform Fire Code.  The facility is located at 5950 Woodbridge Road, Acampo, California 95220.  In March 2003, a new plant was constructed (Plant 3) for a total of three plants  at the facility.\n\nIn Plant 1 the refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from a thermosyphon supply to two high pressure receivers (HPRs).  Liquid is again transferred from HPRs to two low pressure recirculators (LPR-1 and LPR-2) and the wine chillers.  Associated with LPR-1 is a liquid transfer vessel (LTV) where excess liquid ammonia can be routed back to the HPRs.  Pumped liquid is sent to a wi"

The vapor generated from the heat transfer from the process equipment (chillers and jacketed tanks) is returned to each accumulator, respectively in which constant pressures are maintained by back pressure regulating valves.  The vapor from the accumulators is then pulled to the compressors (4) where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers (5) where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the thermosyphon receiver (TSR) and HPRs.  The liquid ammonia in the thermosyphon receiver is used to cool the oil in the two FES screw compressors.  Liquid ammonia flows into the oil cooler vessel and the vapor/liquid mixture is syphoned back to the TSR.  A portable auto purger is used to remove non-condensibles collected in the high pressure receiver and the condensers.  The purger is mounted on a portable rack and can be used at both Plant 1 and Plant 2.  As the pressure in the process increases, the purger is connected and left to run for approximately one week to remove any non-condensibles.  The process also has a fire dump box/control box which can be used in only an emergency situation to equalize the pressures between the low side and the high side, or to manually reduce the system pressure.\n\nIn Plant 2 the refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from a thermosyphon supply to a high pressure receiver (HPR).  Liquid is transferred from HPR to wine chillers (21) and glycol chillers (4).  Vapor from the chillers is returned to two suction accumulators both equipped with a liquid transfer vessel.  Liquid from the accumulators is routed back to the HPR, whereas, the vapor from the accumulators is pulled to the compressors (7) where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased."
