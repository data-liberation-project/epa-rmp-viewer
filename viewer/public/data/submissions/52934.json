This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident protection, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE SHELBY #3 GAS PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Shelby #3 gas plant, located approximately 12 miles southwest of Center in Shelby County, Texas, operates a Joule-Thompson plant to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  The plant products include pipeline quality natural gas (primarily methane) and natural gas liquids comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The process to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Shelby #3 gas plant which contain above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\n? Product Tank comprised of C2+ mixture.\n\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, there are no regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity present at the Shelby #3 gas plant.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nBecause the process at the Shelby #3 gas plant which is regulated by the EPA RMP rule is not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, no additional steps for accidental release prevention are required.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the Shelby #3 gas plant that have occurred in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite effects.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATON\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Shelby #"

This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Shelby #3 gas plant has had very safe operations over its brief history.  However, the facility continually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility.  Our company is very active in promoting coordination between the local emergency response agencies and our facility personnel.  Ongoing communication between our facility and the emergency responders is a integral part of our operations."
