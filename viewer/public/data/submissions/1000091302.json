It produces fuel-grade ethanol from corn through a fermentation process.  The spent grains, or Distillers Dried Grains and Solubles, is sold as animal feed and a portion of the carbon dioxide generated during fermentation also recovered and sold.\r\n\r\nUnited Ethanol, LLC is required by law to denature its ethanol product prior to shipment.  A liquid petroleum based blend is used which includes three regulated flammable substances; pentane, isopentane and butane.  The denaturant is stored in an outdoor, 2,031 barrel (85,000 gallon) storage tank surrounded by a foot high secondary containment dike. \r\nDenaturant is also present in rail tanker cars that have been loaded with blended ethanol and denaturant awaiting shipment by the rail carrier.\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION RESPONSE POLICY\r\nUnited Ethanol, LLC is committed to managing the facility in accordance with relevant regulations and good manufacturing practices to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance from the storage tank and loading process. If an accidental release was to occur, United Ethanol, LLC has response measures in place to minimize the impact of the release.  \r\n\r\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nIn assessing the ramifications of a worst case release scenario, United Ethanol, LLC employed the latest available version of RMP*COMP software.  The objective was to estimate the distance to the flammable endpoint for a mixture containing the regulated organics pentane, isopentane and butane.  Data for the model was supplied by the Safety Data Sheets from our vendor.  It was the source for physical data such as liquid density and concentrations of the three qualified components.  Since this data was supplied as a potential range of values all were assumed for the pur"

Also accounted for was the presence of a 5 foot high concrete containment dike as well as the outdoor release.  The software calculates the flammable endpoint of pentane and isopentane defined as the distance to an overpressure of 1 psi and by a radiative energy exposure of 5 kilowatts per square meter.  The resulting calculation indicated that this distance is less than 0.4 miles.  CAPS version 10C software from University of MO using 2010 US Census Bureau estimated that there are four residential receptors within this affected area.\r\nThe Alternate Worst Case Scenario is if a leak occurred while loading a rail tanker Car. The process is monitored by an Operator through out the entire process. If a leak did occurred, the containment pit at the loading station would minimize any expansion of a puddle. The Source Strength and Threat Zone were developed using ALOHA 5.4.7 and MARPLOT. The end point is less than .07 miles.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nNo accidental release has occurred in the past five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN AND EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\nUnited Ethanol, LLC has developed an emergency response plan and an emergency action plan that provides procedures for:\r\n\r\n(1)\tinforming the public and local emergency response agencies about an accidental release;\r\n(2)\tfirst aid and emergency medical treatment for employees;\r\n(3)\temergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\r\n(4)\tthe availability of emergency response equipment and its inspection, testing and maintenance;\r\n(5)\ttraining all employees in relevant procedures; and\r\n(6)\temergency response plan review and update.\r\n\r\nUnited Ethanol, LLC employees receive emergency response training annually.
