Huntington St.\nMemphis, MO. 63555\n\nFor further information contact:  Jodey Lancaster, Plant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\n? The owners, management, and employees of Kerr Grain & Seed, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n? The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed.\n? The maximum quantity stored would be 44,000 pounds in our one-1200 gallon storage tank.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario\n\nA:  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 44000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 2.3 miles.\n\nB:  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 3 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n? The facility has implemented the provisions of  \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History.\n\nA:  There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia i"

The Emergency Response Program.\n\n- Kerr Grain & Seed, Inc. has:\nA written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\nProvided state and local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\n- Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  We conduct Monthly Safety Meetings, Safety Equipment Checklist, Emergency Spill Equipment Procedures, and Anhydrous Ammonia Certification Tests.  There are no additional specific Anhydrous Ammonia safety recommendations at this time.\n\n\nKerr Grain & Seed INC,\nJodey Lancaster, President"
