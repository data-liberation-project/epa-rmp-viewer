This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the NGL transloading and storage system. \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nOccidental Permian Ltd. covered process is the equipment and piping associated with the NGL transloading and storage system located at 565 Gusher Road in Levelland, TX.  The regulated substances is pentane. The main operation is described below: \r\nNGLs are received through a truck unloading rack into bullet style storage tanks. Pumps are used to push the NGLs out of the storage tanks and into railcars. No reactions or conversion are taking place at Occidental Permian Ltd., therefore no process chemistry is in order and does not need to be accounted for.\r\nThe maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 2,300,000 pounds of pentane.  \r\n\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: One worst-case analysis has been defined for the covered process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment report, which is included as part of the RMP documentation.  \r\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: One alternative case release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment, which is included as part of the RMP documentation.  \r\n\r\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\r\nAlthough the storage and use of pentane has inherent potential risks and the worst-case release scenario can potentially reach the community, Occidental Permian Ltd. has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.
