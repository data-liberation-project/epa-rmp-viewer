We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u0015 A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\u0015 A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\u0015 An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\u0015 A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\u0015 An overview of our emergency response program\n\nThe Dupont New Johnsonville plant consist of 1500 acres located on the west border of Humphreys County, bordering the Tennessee River, and approximately 2 miles North of Hwy. 70 and the City of New Johnsonville Tennessee.  The Plant utilizes approximately 200 acres for it's manufacturing needs.  The remainder of the property is set aside as a wildlife habitat and location of the Employees Recreation area.\n\nOur facility produces titanium dioxide (TiO2) via the chloride process.  Titanium dioxide pigment is used to add whiteness and brightness to paint, paper, plastics, and other products.  In our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics                                          Use at Facility        \n\nChlorine                                       Produce  Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4 )\nTitanium Tetrachloride                 Intermediate for TiO2\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency plann"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios. \n\nWorstcase Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe worstcase release scenarios for the Johnsonville site  involve the failure of a chlorine barge storage tank released over a 10 minute time interval. With the weather conditions stipulated by the EPA, and no administrative controls or mitigation measures considered, public and environmental receptors could potenitally be impacted. Determinations were made using EPA off-site consequence Analysis guidance.     \n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe Alternate release scenarios involve the release of 300 pounds of chlorine and 4000 pounds of Titanium Tetrachloride from an oxidation reactor over a 10 minute time interval.  Average meteorological conditions provided by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for Nashville, Tennessee were used for New Johnsonville, TN.  Determinations were made using SAFER (TM) Trace 8.0 (b) atmospheric dispersion modeling software.  Impacted environmental receptors include wildlife sanctuaries and a state park.  Public receptors include industrial areas and the Tennessee River as a public recreational area. \n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful accident prevention programs including:"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases as well as all safety incidents that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of the only accidental chemical release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nOur plant had a release of liquid titanium tetrachloride in 1997, while maintenance men were breaking lines for process repairs, which involved  25 pounds of the substance.  No offsite consequences occurred, but 2 injuries occurred onsite.  Appropriate emergency response measures were taken during this event.  \n\nFor each of our safety incidents, we have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan, which meets all of the requirements as stated in the RMP rule.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan, and conduct annual community wide emergency drills."
