The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios. The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  \n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Weyerhaeuser.  These requirements are:\n\n* One worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, or sulfur dioxide, whichever has the greatest potential impact).\n\n* One alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process (i.e., chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, and sulfur dioxide).\n\nThe following information summarize"

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Weyerhaeuser Company in Longview, Washington (Weyerhaeuser) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Weyerhaeuser workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Weyerhaeuser has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Weyerhaeuser and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Weyerhaeuser.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Weyerhaeuser.\n\nThe risk management program at Weyerhaeuser consists of three elements:\n\n* A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5.\n\n* A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4.\n\n* An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nThe risk management program at Weyerhaeuser is only one component of the safety program at Weyerhaeuser.

Before using a hazardous substance at Weyerhaeuser, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at Weyerhaeuser, Weyerhaeuser considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect Weyerhaeuser workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nWeyerhaeuser reduces the inventory of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at Weyerhaeuser, Weyerhaeuser limits the inventory of this substance to the lowest practical level whenever possible. Weyerhaeuser has a formal Chemical Management program in place to support the limitation and reduction of hazardous substance inventories.  This program is designed to promote safe handling, storage, and use of chemicals as well as to limit the number and amount of chemicals stored on-site.\n\nWeyerhaeuser prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at Weyerhaeuser, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nWeyerhaeuser limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Weyerhaeuser trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  We have a fully staffed on-site Fire Department as well as hazardous materials technicians in the operating units.

We have implemented reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate hazards.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we work to control and contain the release in a manner that provides for the safety of workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  We provide response training to Weyerhaeuser personnel, designate an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinate response efforts with the local emergency response agencies.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, Weyerhaeuser established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety and the Risk Manager to oversee emergency response-related activities.\n\n\n1.2 The Weyerhaeuser Company and Regulated Substances\nWeyerhaeuser is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related finished paper products.

Compliance Audit.  Weyerhaeuser audits covered processes to be certain that the Weyerhaeuser prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of Weyerhaeuser operations.  Weyerhaeuser assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n9. Incident Investigation.  Weyerhaeuser investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar incidents can be prevented.  Weyerhaeuser trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n10. Employee Participation.  Weyerhaeuser developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of Weyerhaeuser workers are addressed.  Weyerhaeuser encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHA's and operating procedures.\n\n11. Hot"

      "SummaryText": "Work Permits.  Weyerhaeuser established a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Weyerhaeuser facility.  Weyerhaeuser reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor or designee reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the Weyerhaeuser safe work practices orientation.\n\n12. Contractors.  Weyerhaeuser established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the Weyerhaeuser facility are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that Weyerhaeuser only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  Weyerhaeuser explains to the contractor supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, Weyerhaeuser safe work practices, and Weyerhaeuser emergency response procedures.  Weyerhaeuser requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at Weyerhaeuser before that worker begins work at the Weyerhaeuser site.  Weyerhaeuser periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, Weyerhaeuser has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at Weyerhaeuser.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia.  Industry standards are followed at Weyerhaeuser to help ensure safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia vendor supplies anhydrous ammonia via a Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the anhydrou"

The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n* Informing the local emergency response agencies and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences.\n\n* Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances at Weyerhaeuser.\n\n* Controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment.\n\n* Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment.\n\n* Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan.\n\nWeyerhaeuser trains some employees to the Hazardous Technician level to use these emergency response procedures for on-site response.  All Weyerhaeuser personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  Weyerhaeuser periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local emergency response agencies.\n\nThe written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)) and has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local emergency response agencies.  Weyerhaeuser maintains a regular dialogue with the local emergency response agencies, and Weyerhaeuser provides appropriate information to these agencies.\n\n\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nWeyerhaeuser constantly strives to improve the safety to the processes at Weyerhaeuser through both the incident investigation program and by soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  The following changes to improve process safety are planned or have recently been completed.\n\n* Weyerhaeuser replaced two chlorine vaporizers with one smaller unit designed to Chlorine Institute standards and routed the safety valve on the new unit to a scrubbing system - these changes reduce the likelihood of a chlorine release caused by degraded equipment or process upsets\n\n* Weyerhaeuser"

The three 60 ton tanks will be filled from 90-ton rail cars supplied by an external vendor as required. \n\n* Weyerhaeuser is planning on routing the output from the perimeter chlorine sensors in the Chemical Supply process to the Communication Center so they can be monitored 24 hours a day independent of the operations.  Additionally, the internal area chlorine sensors are routed to the department control room.  These sensors provide early detection of chlorine releases, thus minimizing potential consequences. \n\n* Weyerhaeuser worked with the sulfur dioxide vendor to replace the sulfur dioxide storage tank - replacing the old tank will reduce the likelihood of a sulfur dioxide release caused by degraded equipment"
