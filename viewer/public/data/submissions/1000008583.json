If a release should occur, the facility is prepared to to cooperate and support the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate the release to minimize the effect of the release on the community.\n\nGeneral Operations;\nWe are located in a small rural communty.  Our business is selling fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, and related items to farmers in the surronding community.  We also provide custom application services of fertilizer and pesticides to our grower customers.  Our employess are trained and experienced in the proper and safe handling of hazardous materials.  New employees are trained by management and given on-the-job review by experienced employees.\n\nAmmonia:\nWe have an 18,000 gallon storage tank and several mobile tanks for delivery.  We do not mix or react ammonia.  Use is seasonal.  Most of ammonia handling occurs in April-June and a second use period occurs in October-November.\n\nAccident History:\nWe have had no accidents in the past five years.\n\nRisk Management:\nWe operate our installation under the supervision of the Ohio Department of Agriculture and depend upon their inspections as validation of our inspections, maintenance, and operations policies.\nThe scale of our operation is beyond our assets in people and material to respond to a sizable release.  We rely on the Pickaway County Local Emergency Planning Committee to be the major reactive resource.\n\n"
