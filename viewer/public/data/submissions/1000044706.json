Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of Safeway, El Monte DC to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Safeway, El Monte DC implements this policy toward chemical and general safety through ongoing employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  \r\n\r\nSafeway, El Monte DC's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  Safeway has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Safeway, El Monte DC was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.

The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas. The facility is manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia to provide refrigeration for several refrigerated warehouses.  There are two ammonia systems that operate independently and are located in separate buildings on the property; Meat Service Center (MSC) and Perishables (PER). The facility uses approximately 22,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system for the MSC system and 5,972 pounds of ammonia in the PER system. Each area has several evaporators used to keep various rooms cold.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tIIAR Bulletin 107, Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\r\n\u00bf\tIIAR Bulletin 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\r\n\u00bf\tIIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\r\n\u00bf\tIIAR Publication R 1, A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\r\n\r\nIn addition, Safeway, El Monte DC has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the Cal OSHA 5189 regulation since June 1995.

The PSM prevention programs included developing written operating and maintenance procedures as well as other policies and programs to manage the handling of ammonia at the facility (Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Employee Training, and Participation, etc.) \r\n\r\nEngineering Measures\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system employed by the Safeway, El Monte DC is equipped with a computer which monitors the system. The computer system is connected to controls and status indicators throughout the refrigeration system intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations. This monitoring system is comprised of liquid level controls, pressure and temperature controls and indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing the computer (or facility operators) to effectively monitor and control refrigeration operations. \r\n\r\nThe system is monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by refrigeration operators.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP regulation defines accident as the following:\r\n\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\r\n\u00bf\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\r\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis (October 8-9, 2013), revealed that there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (October 2008 - October 2013).

If a release of ammonia were to occur, the facility will determine the extent of the emergency. Supervisors will contact employees in their department to shut off equipment and evacuate to the designated meeting areas.  The public address system and blow horns will be used in the event that individual contact cannot be made. Some or all of these employees may need to be evacuated.  Additional evacuation instructions are posted inside each building for employee viewing which show locations of all emergency exits and also indicate where to assemble outside each facility for a roll call. Plant management will call 911 in order to reach the Los Angeles County Fire Department HazMat team who will respond to the ammonia release.  All employees are trained annually in the emergency evacuation/response plan. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.\r\n\r\nIf an ammonia release occurs, the employees will immediately notify their supervisor.  The supervisor will use the intercom system and/or telephone to inform the other employees and the Emergency Coordinator.
