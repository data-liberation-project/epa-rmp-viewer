If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \nB.\t\n1.\tFacility Information.\n\nThe maximum quantity of propane stored would be 188,700 pounds. It is sold at retail.\n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n          a.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of  the largest storage tank released as a gas. The maximum quantity released would be 94,400 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 1.0 pounds per square inch or psi) is 0.4 miles.  \n\n          b.\tThe alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 1.0 psi) is 0.03 miles.  \n     \n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of National Fire Protection Association Code NFPA - 58, 2nd Edition.\n\n5.\tFive-Year Accident History.\t\t\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\f\n6.\tEmergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has:\n\n\ta.\ta written action plan, in accorda"
