This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of out processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nPetrologistics Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant, located in Sulphur, Louisiana, uses a mixed hydrocarbon gas feed to produce several regulated flammables such as propane, butane, ethane, and pentane.  Chemicals maintained on site at the plant, listed on the EPA's list of flammable chemicals, and are above EPA's threshold quantity are propane, butane, and pentane.  Other regulated chemicals used in our process, which are stored below the threshold quantity, may be present but not subject to RMP.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the chemical complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the chemical complex.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).

Within this program, each process is systemically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant primarily used the What-if/Checklist method for future Process Hazard Analysis.

Oral review and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process.  The operators have been consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training.  Recommendations are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change \r\n\r\nThe Management of Change program for the Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for covered processes to help ensure that a change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.

The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) develop written procedures, (3) perform inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies and, (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in consistent manner and provides basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).
