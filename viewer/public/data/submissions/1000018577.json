This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of out processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nPetrologistics Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant, located in Sulphur, Louisiana, uses a mixed hydrocarbon gas feed to produce several regulated flammables such as propane, butane, ethane, and pentane.  Chemicals maintained on site at the plant, listed on the EPA's list of flammable chemicals, and are above EPA's threshold quantity are propane, butane, and pentane.  Other regulated chemicals used in our process, which are stored below the threshold quantity, may be present but not subject to RMP.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the chemical complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the chemical complex.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that address known corrosion concerns and known hazards associated within inadvertent mixing of specific chemicals.  For the different pro"

The chemical complex insures that the processes are maintained within the limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems, and highly trained personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant also maintains a database, this accessible by both the employees and contractor supervision, which provides information about the design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical classification, etc.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing  inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure the hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systemically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant primarily used the What-if/Checklist method for future Process Hazard Analysis.  The analysis is conducted using a tem of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards ofthe process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to people associated with the process until for comments and forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

These procedures define how tasks related to process operations and safely performed.  At the Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant, operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n- Steps for safely conducting activities\n\n- Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n\n- Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment required and steps to take if exposed to particular chemical.\n\n\n\nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training.\n\n\n\nAll new employees assigned as operators receive comprehensive training before being assigned to a specific operating area.  This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and compressors, general overview of the process, properties and hazard substances in the process, and detailed review of complex procedures, such as, safe work practices and of emergency response.

Oral review and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process.  The operators have been consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training.  Recommendations are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change \n\n\n\nThe Management of Change program for the Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for covered processes to help ensure that a change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through a full management of change program to help ensure process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the change.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Depropanizer Plant conducts a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed in service.

The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) develop written procedures, (3) perform inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies and, (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in consistent manner and provides basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, the equipment will be repaired in a timely manner.  All outstanding deficiencies are tracked until such time a final solution has been implemented and documented.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.
