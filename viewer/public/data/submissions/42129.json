The facility has 2 plants. Plant #1 was started in 1968 and Plant #2 in 2001.  Anhydrous ammonia is the RMP regulated substance which is used in the process as a refrigerant to cool and liquify CO2.  The site has 25 employees.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe Oregon CO2 facility is regulated by EPA RMP regulations and subject to OSHA PSM standard.  The summary below discusses some of the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAt the Oregon CO2 facility, employees are encouraged to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Specific ways an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan at the CO2 plant.  This plan includes the participation of employees in process hazard analysis (PHA), pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR), and being involved in incident investigations surrounding the plant.   Plant employees are trained on the plant Process Safety Information, to include at least the following: (1) information pertaining to the hazards of the hazardous chemicals in the process; (2) information pertaining to the technology of the process; and (3) information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  Plant employees are involved in the review of PSM/RMP covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are correct and recommend any necessary changes.  The employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety and employee safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Oregon CO2 facility keeps a variety of technical documents in the company's electronic document control system and on site, that are used to help maintain "

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters.  The plant manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provide in material safety data sheets (MSDSs) or in the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), Ammonia Data Book located in the plant managers office.  Information on the compatibility and reactivity of ammonia and additional hazards to be considered are also summarized in the IIAR data book.  While ammonia does react with some chemicals, these are not typically found in or around the CO2 plant or in the process.  The plant operating procedures provide information on the key operating limits for the process.  Plant operators are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these operating limits.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nAir Liquide America Corporation has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and control.  Within this program a PHA shall be completed for each new and/or major modified facility or process prior to the initial startup or re-start.  This action will help define and correct process safety deficiencies in a proposed design for a new project or changes to existing facilities.\nThe PHA for plant #1 was conducted in July 1997, and revalidated in April 2004.  The PHA for plant#2 was done in February 2001.\nThe PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the pr"

The plant manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the mitigation options. \n  \nOperating Procedures\nThe Oregon CO2 facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) Unit Startup, (2) Unit Normal Operation Procedures, (3) Unit Shut-Down, (4) Emergency Shutdown, (5) Vapor Ammonia Evacuation, (6) Anhydrous Ammonia Unloading Procedure, and (7) Liquid Ammonia Recovery. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are reviewed periodically by the operators and annually certified as current and accurate. \n\nTraining\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the Oregon CO2 plant has implemented a formal training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive training on general orientation, site rules and practices, familiarization with the site, use of safety procedures and equipment, accident investigation and emergency procedures.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.

Training is documented and tracked in a training matrix for each operator.  Means are used to verify that the operator understands the training.\n\nContractors\nThe Oregon CO2 facility uses contractors to supplement its own work force when maintenance activities exceed the capabilities or time available for their own operators.  Contractors are made aware of the potential dangers involved with a system covered by Process Safety Management (PSM).  Procedures are in place to make sure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform the CO2 plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

This procedure outlines the requirements for documenting, evaluating the impact and approving planned deviations from procedure.  The MOC system is a systematic process designed to help prevent inadvertent, unintended or unauthorized changes that may cause unsafe conditions, product quality problems, process hazards, unplanned outages, etc.  This standard also helps to ensure that changes are technically sound and that Quality and HSE safeguards originally designed into the facility are either maintained or enhanced.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAir Liquide America defines management systems and establishes the requirements for communicating, investigating and reporting of incidents at all facilities through the use of an Incident Investigation and Reporting procedure.

Incidents such as unusual or unexpected event including personnel injury (OSHA recordable), equipment damage, equipment or material failure, excursions outside specified operating ranges, interruptions in process operations, interlock activation, interlock failure or the production of product of an unacceptable quality are promptly investigated.  The plant manager is responsible for maintaining a log and track incidents and corrective actions through completion.   Results of findings and corrective actions are shared with employees who could be affected by the findings.  Reports are retained for at least 5 years to be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help insure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Oregon CO2 plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  A team knowledgeable about the facility must conduct the audit, but the majority of the team must not be involved in the day-to-day operations of the ammonia.  Recommendations and findings from the Audit team are resolved in a timely manner.  The plant manager is responsible for obtaining engineering support to correct or modify the system based on the recommendations.  Resolutions to the recommendations are documented.
