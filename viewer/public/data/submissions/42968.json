      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nUSEPA?s RMP regulation (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996 and updated in April of 2004, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP regulation applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under ?68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release.  Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.  Since public employees are covered under the state-delegated OSHA program, the Canal Road Station is subject to the OSHA PSM standard and is therefore subject to Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe Lafayette Water Works Canal Road Station utilizes more than the threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process.  Therefore, this facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in ?68.150.  The Lafayette Water Works Canal Road Station submitted their initial RMP by the original June 21, 1999 deadline as required.  To comply with the five-year update requirement, the offsite consequence analyses have been reviewed to determine whether the parameters and assumptions used are still valid and to make any necessary changes to update the RMP.\n\nUSEPA?s RMP regulation requires that covered facilities prepare an executive summary.  The following represents the executive summary, summarizing the items required as described "

The Prevention Plan contains safety information relating to chlorine and the chlorination system and establishes standard protocols for items such as system operations, maintenance, system changes, contractor safety, and incident investigation.  The Prevention Plan also describes training for employees on the safe operation of the chlorination systems. \n\nLafayette Water Works facilities are equipped with ambient chlorine detectors and audible alarms.  The 1-ton cylinders are equipped with vacuum regulators, through which chlorine gas flows to the injector under vacuum.  Loss of vacuum causes the vacuum-regulating valve to automatically shut off the gas supply at the source.  \n\nAll potential releases from Lafayette Water Works facilities will be responded to by the Lafayette Fire Department, whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine at the facilities and trained to respond to such emergencies.\n\n?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Canal Road Station facility. The Canal Road Station facility uses two 1-ton chlorine containers connected in parallel to supply chlorine to the pumped water.  The containers are delivered to the site to a location just outside the building.  The containers are then moved inside the building for use. One container is isolated by a vacuum automatic transfer valve.  An additional one to two 1-ton containers, which may be empty or full, are stored inside the building.  \n\nGaseous chlorine from the 1-ton containers is drawn by a vacuum to a c"

After being metered at the chlorinator, the gaseous chlorine is mixed with treated water (pumped to provide a higher pressure for injection) to form a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is then injected into well water, which is then distributed to Lafayette Water Works customers.\n\n?68.155? Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the regulation, one worst case and one alternative case release scenario were evaluated.  In November 2004, City of Lafayette and Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. reviewed and updated the offsite consequence analyses at the Canal Road Station.   Safety information and hazard analysis documentation were reviewed to determine whether the parameters and assumptions used in the 1999 analyses are still valid. The results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.  Any changes resulting from this review are reported in this resubmission.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined in accordance with the requirements in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c).  For the Canal Road Station facility, the worst-case scenario is a release from one of the 1-ton containers (greatest amount held in a single vessel) of chlorine.  It is assumed that the container ruptures and its contents escape in ten minutes.  The worst-case scenario requires a ground level release height.  It was assumed that the release occurred outside, and no mitigation measures were incorporated into the evaluation.  The USEPA RMP*Comp software was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario.  The toxic endpoint distance indicated that residential areas, parks, schools and a hospital could be impacted by a worst case release\n\nThe facility is also required to complete at least one alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario considered was completed in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.28.  The alte"

      "SummaryText": "rnative release scenario involved a leak from the connection at the chlorine container gas outlet valve.  This valve has an internal diameter of 5/16-inches.  A leak from this valve will result in a choked release of chlorine vapor (taken from the gas at the top of the chlorine container).  It is assumed that this leak occurs inside the building, and the mitigation provided by the building was incorporated into the evaluation.  As with the worst case scenario, the USEPA RMP*Comp software was used to determine the distance to toxic endpoint, and the resulting distance to the toxic endpoint was predicted to extend off-site.\n\n?68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Plan describes measures taken at the Lafayette Water Works facilities to prevent releases.  The Lafayette Water Works has a Prevention Program for the chlorine systems, which is documented in the Prevention Plan.  These prevention measures include elements such as employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, and compliance audits.\n\nMalcolm Pirnie, Inc., with the assistance of Canal Road Station management and staff familiar with the processes operation and maintenance, conducted a compliance audit as part of the RMP update in August 2004.  The results of this audit, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) of the chlorine system using the ?What-If? method was conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc., with the assistance of Canal Road station management and staff familiar with the process? operation and maintenance, in September, 2004.
