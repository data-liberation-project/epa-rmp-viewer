This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nQEP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  QEP's Clear Creek Gas Storage Central Facility has coordinated with the Evanston City Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nThe Clear Creek Gas Storage Central Facility is located approximately 12 miles northeast of the town of Evanston, Wyoming.\r\n\r\nClear Creek Gas Storage LLC. is a gas storage facility. Gas may be delivered to or received from Questar Pipeline, Northwest Pipeline, Overthrust Pipeline or Kern River Pipeline. Two Caterpillar 3608 engines coupled with JDG-4 compressors provide both injection and withdrawal compression services. The compressors are designed for single or two stage operation.\r\n\r\nWhen set to the injection mode, capacity of the facility is 35MMCF/D.\r\nGas is received from the pipeline or pipelines and sent to one or both compressors.\r\nAfter two stage compression the gas is delivered to one or both of the injection/withdrawal wells for storage. (44-4B and 35-4B)\r\n \r\nWhen set to the withdrawal mode, capacity of the facility is 50 MMCF/D.\r\nGas is received from the storage wells and enters an inlet separator through the Inlet Heater and Choke. Free water and condensate are separated from the gas stream. The water is injected into a water disposal well (32-9B) located adjacent to the site. The condensate is sent to the condensat"

The liquid condensate is then sent to one of two 400bbl atmospheric storage tank for sale by truck. \r\n\r\nThe gas stream then enters the 50MMCF/D JT Plant that provides hydrocarbon and water dewpoint control. Ethylene Glycol is injected into the inlet gas, or tube side of the Gas to Gas Exchanger to absorb water from the gas stream. The EG is separated in the Cold Separator and returned to the Glycol Reboiler for regeneration. The Glycol Reboiler also provides heat for the NGL Reboiler via pumps that circulate hot glycol through the Stabilizer Reboiler. \r\n\r\nNGL liquids are produced as a result of chilling the gas through a combination of the Gas to Gas exchanger and the JT Valve. NGL is dumped from the Cold Separator to the Stabilizer Tower, where is comes into contact with the Stabilizer Rebioler. Lighter vapors are sent through an overhead/NGL Heat Exchanger and collected by the Overhead Compressor and re-circulated. The NGL is sent through a fan operated NGL Air Cooler and then through the Overhead/NGL Heat Exchanger and then to the 50,000 gallon pressurized storage tank for sale by truck.\r\n\r\nThe gas stream exits the Cold Separator and enters the shell side of the Gas to Gas exchanger, then continues on to the Compressor Suction Header. After single stage compression, the gas is delivered to one or any combination of the connected pipelines. \r\n\r\nIf market conditions require, Clear Creek was designed to be able to take delivery from a pipeline and simultaneously inject a portion of the gas and redeliver the remaining volume to another pipeline. \r\n\r\nThe Clear Creek Plant is equipped with a high pressure Flare and a low pressure (LP) Flare, for environment purposes. The LP Flare is used to dispose of the various tank vents and other low pressure vents in the plant. The HP Flare is used to dispose of PSV vents and various other high pressure vents in the facility.\r\n\r\nCLEAR CREEK SAFET"
