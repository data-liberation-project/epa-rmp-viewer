Facility Information\n\n\n\nA? Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nA? The maximum quantity stored at this facility is 131,325 pounds in our 30,000 gallon tank and 78,795 pounds in our 18,000 gallon tank or 210,120 pounds combined. Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program, the 210,120 pounds is rounded to 210,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\n\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\nA? Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nA? To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\nb.
