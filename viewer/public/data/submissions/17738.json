The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released \u0005.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the largest vessel in the system with the greater amount of ammonia would release the entire inventory of 7,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would occur inside the compressor room, which is in direct contact with the outside. Although for modeling purposes, no mitigation was taken into account.  Although building mitigation was not used, the building containment would be a substantial mitigation factor.  Modeling was done by use of RMP-COMP.\n\nThe distance to the EPA end-point is off-site\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - For the alternative scenario, it was assumed that the system would loose its entire inventory through a 1 inch diameter short pipe (drain) at the bottom of the liquid receiver, without any mitigation.  Modeling was done by use of ALHOA (Aerial Location of Hazardous Atmospheres).\n\nThe distance to the EPA end-point is off-site\n\nBoth the worst-case and alternative scenarios are unlikely because Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. has employed the following control and mitigating measures.\n7 Industry standards and quality controls were followed in the design of this equipment and its manufacture.\n7 The facility insures only qualified personnel operate the system.\n7 The facility requires that all PSM elements as well as company maintenance policies are followed.\n7 The facility is located in Yakima County that has trained emergency response team to respond quickly to isolate and potential releases.\n7 Only trained and authorized personnel have access to the system.\n\nA more realistic scenario would be that of a pressure relief valve lifting, discharging ammonia vapor from ven"

The facility is located in Yakima County, on the Yakima Tribal Nation.  The plant property is fenced and Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. contracts with CWI security for 24-hour, on-site, security coverage.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere are 12,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in two (2) single, independent refrigeration systems on the facility and is the only process subject to the RMP program.  The system with the greater amount of ammonia has 7,400 pounds in its inventory; the other has 4,900 pounds.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n C.
