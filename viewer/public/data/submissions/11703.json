      "SummaryText": "\nSchwan's has historically placed a high priority on chemical \nsafety. The corporate environmental compliance manager has been \nassigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and \nfor ammonia refrigeration safety in particular since 1991. \nSchwan's maintains 3 - shift coverage of emergency responders \ntrained to the 24-hour technician level at all facilities with \nammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule.\n\nThe Salina, KS facility manufactures frozen pizza. Anhydrous \nammonia is used in the refrigeration system at this facility. \nAmmonia is the most efficient and environmentally compatible \nrefrigerant available. Although it is toxic at high concentration \nand is an irritating gas, it is not a cumulative metabolic poison, \ndoes not cause cancer or other dread diseases and does not cause \nlasting environmental damage. The refrigeration system at this \nfacility contains about 112,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nThe Salina, KS facility uses liquid propane as a back-up fuel for \nnatural gas-fired ovens. The inventory of 100,000 pounds of \npropane is normally in storage and is used only during periods of \nextremely cold weather.\n\nSchwan's calculates ammonia worst case release scenarios using the \nModel RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration, May 1996. All Schwan's \nmanufacturing facilities are located in areas that meet the \ndefinition of \"urban\". Schwan's has chosen to calculate worst case \nrelease poundage for the largest high-pressure receiver in the \nsystem, filled to full calculated hydraulic capacity. Reduced \nvolume for administrative controls was not used, since the \ndescribed scenario would probably occur only as a result of a \ncatastrophic vessel rupture caused by a total filling of the \nvessel, closure of all vessel block valves, failure of all \npressure relief valves, with a simultaneous increase in liquid \ntemperature sufficient to overpressure the vessel to the point of \nfailure.\n\nIt is the professional judgement of Schwans Environmental Health \nan"

The alternate case will be a release rate of 400 \npounds per minute. Both scenarios have off-site impacts.\n\nFor propane, worst case and alternate case scenarios were \ncalculated using RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, May \n1996, for flammable substances.\n\nWorst case assumes that the propane tank is 80% full. A vapor \ncloud explosion occurs involving 100% of the material in the tank. \nThe consequence distance is to an overpressure of 1.0 psi.\n\nAlternate case assumes that the propane tank is 80% full and that \nthe tank contents are released over a period of 10 minutes at a \nconstant rate. The consequence distance is to Lower Flammability \nLimit (LFL) of 35 mg./L., \"D\" atmospheric stability and wind speed \nof 3.0 m./sec. In order to achieve a more conservative result, \nrural conditions are used. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is covered by the OSHA Process \nSafety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nAlthough the Salina, KS facility has experienced 4 releases which \nwere reported under EPCRA Section 304 in the five years beginning \n21 June 1994, none was more than 500 pounds and none resulted in \nonsite or offsite casualties or off-site evacuations.\n\nThe Salina, KS facility maintains a 3-shift emergency response \nteam, trained at the 24-hour technician level. The team numbers 24 \nmembers. The training is conducted by the Corporate Environmental \nCompliance Manager. The training is designed with a heavy emphasis \non ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, personal protective \nequipment up to use of Level `A' suits and interaction with an \nincident command system (ICS).
