Six (6) chemicals in the amounts expected to be handled by our facility exceed the RMP Threshold Quantity (TQ).  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Evonik manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operation procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the safe design of the plant.\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER Standard.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\r\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\nThe facility will handle six (6) regulated substances above threshold quantities subject to the RMP regulation.  Acrylonitrile, Formaldehyde (solution), Propylene Oxide, and Ethylenediamine are on the RMP rule toxic chemicals list; Dimethylamine and Trimethylamine are on the flammable chemicals list.\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacture of specialty chemicals.  These specialty chemicals are used by our customers in a variety of applications.  Raw materials are received at our plant by railcar, bulk tank truck, and other containers to be used as feedstock.

All employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  All employees are trained to the First Responder Awareness Level and receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Additionally, the site has designated emergency coordinators that will execute the site emergency plan while providing general plant operations information to community responders.  In addition, emergency drills are conducted periodically.\r\n6.\tPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\nThe facility resolves recommendation from Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs) and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and/or operating procedures to improve safety."
