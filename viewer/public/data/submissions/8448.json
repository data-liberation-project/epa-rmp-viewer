The properties that make propane a valuable fuel source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it.  It is the policy of the Co-op and it's employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community.  Safety depends upon the competent training of our personnel, the manner in which we handle propane and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n     \nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n     The primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute propane to our customers as a fuel source, with it's primary use being for home heating.  Propane is received by truck (transports) and is stored in two (2) storage tanks.  Propane is distributed from this facility by delivery trucks (bobtails).  The facility has the necessary equipment to safely load and unload transports and bobtails.\n     Access to the tank controls and hoses are restricted, by the use of fencing and locked gates, to authorized employees and management personnel, along with authorized contractors hired to work on the facility.\n     The only regulated substance handled at this facility is propane.  The maximum amount stored at the site is 25,075 gallons or 106,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios:\n     The likely-hood of the loss of the total contents of the largest storage tank is extremely remote due to administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the amount of propane released.  However, if the largest storage tank were to totally fail when filled, there would be a release of 14,875 gallons or 62,475 pounds of propane.  Company polic"

      "SummaryText": "y limits the maximum filling of all tanks to 85% of the capacity at 60 degrees F.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a vapor that finds a source of ignition.  The distance to the end point of 1psi overpressure as a result of the explosion in the worst case scenario is 0.3 miles.  This would extend beyond the facility boundary, encompassing public receptors.\n     The alternative scenario would be a pull-away resulting in the failure of twenty-five (25) foot of four (4) inch hose.  As in the worst case scenario this has not occurred at this facility and if it were to happen the facility has excess flow valves in place to actively mitigate the gas release.  Again, if this event were to happen and the excess flow valves stopped the flow, the contents of the hose would be released.  The vapor would expand and find an ignition source and explode, creating a shockwave and an overpressure.  A 1 psi overpressure would extend one hundred and seventy-five feet, which is the end point for the alternative scenario.  This distance would extend beyond the facility boundary and encompass public receptors.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations.  The facility design and construction is in accordance with the National Fire Prevention Association's Standard 58 (NFPA-58).  It is formally inspected a minimum of twice a year for compliance to all applicable standards by an out-of-house person.  Employees that have propane responsibilities receive training to meet Federal and state requirements to handle hazardous materials along with additional training using the NPGA's Certified Employee Training Program (CETP) and guidelines.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n     This site has not experienced a reportable accidental release of propane in the five years pior to the date of submitting"

However, employees are familiar with the NPGA's LP-Gas Handbook, \"Guidelines for Developing Plant emergency Response Procedures\" and \"How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\"  This has been discussed with the local fire department and a representative of the fire department is familiar with the location.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n     This facility utilizes  NFPA Standard - 58 and OSHA standards as guidelines for the safe storage and handling of propane.  At this time there are no further plans to modify or change the facility."
