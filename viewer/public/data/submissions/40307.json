      "SummaryText": "City of Lake Jackson (herein referred to as the City) owns and operates a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Lake Jackson, Brazoria County, Texas. The City has reviewed its obligations under EPA?s Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act).  In response to these requirements, the City notes that there are two obligations incumbent on the operations at its facility:\n\n1. ?112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  The City takes this obligation very seriously, and intends to be not only a good neighbor but also a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness. \n\n2. Risk Management Plan ? The City operates a WWTP that stores and uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide in excess of thresholds specified in the RMP Rule. Even prior to the promulgation of the RMP Rule, the City management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by storage and use of chlorine, and has established programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for emergency response in the event of a release.  These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nChlorine is used to treat and disinfect municipal wastewater and sulfur dioxide is used to remove the chlorine.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are delivered as compressed gases in one-ton cylinders.  There are a maximum of four cylinders, or 8,000 pounds, of chlorine and three cylinders, or 6,000 pounds, of sulfur dioxide onsite at the WWTP at any one time.  \n\nThe City recently upgraded the WWTP from and increased it?s capacity from 4 million gallons per day (MGD) to 5.89 MGD.  The City?s original (June 23, 1999) RMP submittal to EPA included one Program 2 process involving chlorine.  In this "

      "SummaryText": "update, the City is reporting an increase in the maximum amount of chlorine onsite and the addition of a sulfur dioxide process.  \n\nThe RMP rule requires one hypothetical worst-case scenario (WCS) to represent all regulated toxic substances in Program 2 processes.  Additional WCSs are required if a release from a process could impact different offsite receptors.  A WCS for the sulfur dioxide process does not have to be reported since the impact of such a release would fall within that of the chlorine process system.  This WCS is reported in the updated RMP plan.\n\nIn addition to the WCS, the RMP rule requires one alternative release scenario (ARS) for each regulated toxic substance in Program 2 processes.  Therefore, two ARSs are included in this updated RMP.\n\nThe City has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate any chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases.  In addition, the City has maintenance, training, and inspection procedures currently in place.  The City has coordinated with local emergency responders, including The Lake Jackson Fire Department. \n\nThe City management is committed to:\n\n? Preventing accidents;\n? Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n? Providing leadership to the community with respect to emergency preparedness;\n? Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with facility operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n? Being a good corporate citizen of Brazoria County.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan provides information about the City?s management of the risks associated with the chlorine disinfection process and subsequent sulfur dioxide process for chlorine removal, but more importantly stresses the commitment to ensuring a safe operation for employees, visitors, and community."
