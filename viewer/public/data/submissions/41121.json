In\n\nresponse to the congressional mandate, EPA promulgated the Risk Management Program Rule\n\n(RMP Rule).\n\n     The RMP Rule identified covered facilities on the basis of use/storage of threshold\n\nquantities of any of a long list of chemicals (see 40 CFR Part 68.130, Table 1) and required those\n\nfacilities to submit to EPA a completed RMP by June 21, 1999.  Further, the RMP Rule requires\n\nthat all covered facilities must review all aspects of their respective plans and re-submit to EPA\n\nRMP updates every five years thereafter as long as a facility is covered by the Rule.\n\n\n\nFINDINGS (as of September, 2004)\n\n     A second compliance audit and a hazard review was completed in September, 2004 for\n\nSt. Bernard Parish, Violet wastewater treatment plant  as required by the RMP rule and the\n\nappropriate offsite consequence assessment (OCA) modeling was re-visit.   No significant\n\nproblems were noted by those efforts.  The OCA continues to predict a very small impact area\n\nsuch that area residents/occupants should have little to no concern relative to the subject facility.\n\n     A table-top rehearsal of the Associated Emergency Response Plan components will be\n\nheld before the end of this year (2004) with the St. Bernard Parish LEPC and others.  This is to\n\nensure that the first responders, e.g., local police and fire department personnel were properly\n\ntrained and coordinat"
