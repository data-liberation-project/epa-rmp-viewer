EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n         1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAt GEO Specialty Chemical's Plant in Cedartown, GA., we are committed to operating and\r\n\r\nmaintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and\r\n\r\nresponsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and\r\n\r\nemergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the\r\n\r\npublic as well as protection of the environment.  This section of the document provides a brief\r\n\r\noverview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and\r\n\r\nimplemented, including:\r\n\r\n\r\n A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n\r\n An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n\r\n A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n\r\n An overview of our emergency response program\r\n\r\n An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical\r\n\r\nreleases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n\r\n The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\r\n\r\n The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\r\n\r\n\r\n          2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nOur facility produces condensed naphthalene sulfonates under the trade name of LOMAR, alkyl\r\n\r\nnaphthalene sulfonates, defoamers and miscellaneous other organic chemicals.  In all, about 250\r\n\r\ndifferent products are manufactured at the Cedartown plant, using about 250  raw materials.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential\r\n\r\nto cause off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\n\r\nTOXICS\r\n\r\nOleum"

The plant also has a white mineral oil system that can be used to blanket the oleum,\r\n\r\ninhibiting the release of fumes from any spills inside the dike.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario   Regulated Toxic Chemical - Oleum"
