              "Description": "  Prevention Program 1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n Process safety information (PSI)\n\n Process hazard analysis\n\n Operating procedures\n\n Training\n\n Mechanical integrity\n\n Management of change\n\n Pre-startup review\n\n Compliance audits\n\n Incident investigation\n\n Employee participation\n\n Hot work permit\n\n Contractors\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our accident prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2.0 PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule, we systematically control the creation, updating, and retention of written documentation associated with our process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our risk management program.  We also use this information directly to ensure that our equipment is suitable for its intended use.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Process Safety Information Details\n\n\n\nWe maintain the following chemical process information for each regulated substance in a covered process as well as for other hazardous materials in both covered and noncovered processes:\n\n\n\n Toxicity information\n\n Permissible exposure limits\n\n Physical data\n\n Reactivity data\n\n Corrosivity data\n\n Thermal and chemical stability data\n\n Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foreseeably occur\n\n\n\nWe use safety data sheets (SDSs) to provide most of the process chemical information.  Whenever required information, such as corrosivity data or hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing, is not available in SDSs, we develop the missing data from other sources and provide it in separate documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe maintain the following required process technology information:\n\n\n\n Block flow or simplified process flow diagram\n\n Process chemistry\n\n Maximum intended inventory\n\n Safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, flow, or composition\n\n Evaluation of the consequences of deviations from established operating limits\n\n\n\nMost of this information comes from the engineering design documents for the processes, but in some cases, we have developed such information through special projects.  Additionally, operating limits, maximum intended inventories, and consequences of deviations not available from engineering design documentation were developed as part of PHAs.\n\n\n\nWe also maintain the following information pertaining to equipment in our regulated processes (as well as for many of our nonregulated processes):\n\n\n\n Materials of construction\n\n Piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs)\n\n Electrical classification\n\n Relief system design and design basis\n\n Ventilation system design\n\n Design codes and standards employed\n\n Material and energy balances for processes built after 6/21/99\n\n Safety systems (interlocks, detection, or suppression systems)\n\n\n\nAgain, most of this information comes from the engineering design documents for the processes as well as from our own maintenance files.  Whenever required information was not available, we obtained the information from equipment vendors, process designers, plant engineering, and/or research and development departments.  In conjunction with our equipment information collection efforts, we documented that our equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  For our older processes, where design information is obsolete, our Engineering Department evaluated the existing design against appropriate safety criteria and documented that the equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested and operated in a safe manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    3.0 PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule, we use process hazard analyses (PHAs) to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.  The most important products of our PHAs are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases.  We ensure that all recommendations from our PHAs are resolved appropriately, and we ensure that information from our PHAs (including recommendation resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Process Hazard Analysis Details\n\n\n\nWe have conducted systematic PHAs of our regulated processes and other hazardous processes at our facility.  We update/revalidate each PHA at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes).  We also conduct PHAs of all new processes before those processes are placed in service.\n\n\n\nWe primarily use the What If techniques to perform PHAs, although we may use other EPA-/OSHA-approved techniques when they are more appropriate for specific applications.  We conduct our PHAs consistent with the procedures presented in the American Institute of Chemical Engineer's (AIChE's) Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures - Second Edition with Worked Examples and address the following:\n\n\n\n Hazards of the process\n\n Identification of any previous incident that had a potential for catastrophic consequences\n\n Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships\n\n Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls\n\n Stationary source (plant) siting\n\n Human factors\n\n Qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls\n\n\n\nOur PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience, including at least one person who has knowledge and experience in the process to be evaluated and a PHA team leader trained in the application of the hazard evaluation technique used for the PHA.\n\n\n\nWe have a system in place to promptly resolve PHA team findings and recommendations, and we communicate findings/recommendation resolutions to potentially affected personnel.  PHAs are implemented in a written report for each analysis soon after the analysis meetings are completed.  Our managers review and resolve the PHA recommendations after receiving the report.  We maintain a written action plan tracking the resolution status of each recommendation, including an individual responsible for resolving each recommendation and a target completion date.  We document the final resolution of each recommendation, and we advise the PHA team of any recommendations that are rejected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    4.0 OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.69 of the RMP rule, we use operating procedures to define how process-related job tasks assigned to our personnel should be performed to avoid incidents.  We use these procedures to (1) train our employees before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, and (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Operating Procedure Details\n\n\n\nOur Area Superintendants, operators, and shift supervisors work together to develop and maintain our operating procedures for all phases of operations including:\n\n\n\n Initial startup\n\n Normal operations\n\n Temporary operations\n\n Emergency shutdown, including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required and assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n\n Emergency operations\n\n Normal shutdown\n\n Startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown\n\n\n\nOur development teams use PSI, information from process designers/equipment manufacturers, and their own experience to create and validate the procedures.\n\n\n\nOur procedures address the following information:\n\n\n\n Steps for safely conducting activities\n\n Safe operating limits\n\n Consequences of process deviations, as well as steps required to correct or avoid such deviations\n\n Safety and health considerations including (1) properties of, and hazards presented by, the chemicals used in the process, (2) precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment, (3) control measures to be taken if physical contact or airborne exposure occurs, (4) quality control for raw materials and control of regulated substance inventory levels, and (5) any special or unique hazards\n\n Safety systems and their functions\n\n\n\nIn addition to our process-specific procedures, we also develop and maintain more widely applicable safe work practices addressing issues such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control of access to processes.  These safe work practices apply to our employees and our contractors.\n\n\n\nWe have a formal review process to approve procedures and changes to procedures.  Furthermore, we annually review existing operating procedures, make any needed revisions, and certify these procedures as current and accurate.  We keep our procedures in locations that are readily accessible to employees who may need the procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    5.0 TRAINING\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.71 of the RMP rule, we train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process/equipment changes are made.  As part of our training, we include provisions for ensuring that employees understand the training (written tests, field demonstrations, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Training Details\n\n\n\nWe provide our operators with initial and refresher training, which includes a general overview of the process, properties of chemicals in the process, and safety and health hazards, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  We provide initial training to new hires or newly assigned employees before they are allowed to work independently as operators.\n\n\n\nPeriodically, at least every eighteen months, we provide our operators with refresher training that, depending on job classification, can include operating procedure training, equipment-specific training, and/or advanced (beyond HAZCOM) chemical-specific training.  Our refresher training courses emphasize process overview information, safe work practices, operating procedures that are rarely used such as emergency shutdown, emergency operation and startup following an emergency shutdown, and any operating issues requested by the shift group.  Our operators are consulted on the frequency of refresher training, and their input is documented and considered when preparing training schedules.\n\n\n\nAll training is accompanied by written tests.  We review the information missed by an employee who does not pass all testing requirements, and we do not allow resumption of work until minimum testing requirements are met.\n\n\n\nAll training is documented and includes the employee's name and date of training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    6.0 MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.73 of the RMP rule, we maintain the mechanical integrity (MI) of our process equipment using an inspection and testing program and a quality assurance program, and we ensure that our equipment is designed and installed correctly so that it operates properly.  We train our maintenance personnel in the hazards of the process, and we also provide additional training on procedures for maintaining the ongoing integrity of our process equipment so that job tasks are performed safely.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 Mechanical Integrity Details\n\n\n\nWe consider all process-related equipment and safety systems that are critical for preventing and/or mitigating releases of regulated substances to be covered by our MI program.  Examples include:\n\n\n\n Pressure vessels and storage tanks\n\n Piping systems including valves\n\n Relief and vent systems and devices\n\n Emergency shutdown systems\n\n Controls such as monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks\n\n Pumps\n\n\n\nOur computerized MI program (Dynastar) uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that is deteriorating and needs repair or replacement before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return deteriorated equipment to acceptable specifications.  We maintain written procedures that support our MI program as follows:\n\n\n\n Our maintenance procedures specify functional tests that operators must perform on specific equipment, as well as procedures to remove equipment from operation for maintenance or return equipment to service following maintenance.\n\n\n\n Our standard maintenance procedures describe the methods that mechanics use to perform repairs, replacements, and installations.\n\n\n\n Our procedures for safe work practices and safety policies specify safe practices for performing maintenance tasks such as lockout/tagout, hot work, confined space entry, line or equipment opening, and control over entry/exit for a covered facility by plant and/or contract maintenance personnel.\n\n\n\n Our inspection, test, and preventive maintenance procedures describe the methods used by mechanics to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks on process equipment.  These procedures follow generally accepted good engineering practices.  The equipment inspection and test frequency is based on information provided by the manufacturer, adjusted by our own experience.\n\n\n\nWe document all inspection, test, and preventive maintenance activities including:\n\n\n\n Date of inspection, test, or preventive maintenance\n\n Person performing the activity\n\n Equipment identifier\n\n Description of the activity performed\n\n Results of the activity (including any deficiencies noted)\n\n\n\nWe identify equipment deficiencies through our inspection, test, and preventive maintenance activities or from routine operating and maintenance tasks and correct them promptly.  If we cannot immediately correct identified equipment deficiencies, we implement protective measures to ensure safe operation until repairs can be made.\n\n\n\nWe have a quality assurance program that addresses new facilities, equipment, maintenance materials, and spare parts.  Our program seeks to verify proper fabrication of new equipment, proper installation of new or repaired/replaced equipment, and use of suitable maintenance materials and spare parts in the preventive maintenance and repair tasks.\n\n\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program covering all MI issues.  Our program uses the procedures described previously.  For example, all mechanics are trained on hazards for all RMP-covered processes and on safe work practices.  Our maintenance personnel also receive training on safe maintenance procedures, preventive maintenance practices, and special skills requiring craft certification.  All training, as described above, occurs before employees perform tasks in RMP-covered areas independently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    7.0 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.75 of the RMP rule, we evaluate and approve all proposed changes (i.e., modifications that are not replacements in kind) to covered process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures prior to implementation through our management of change (MOC) program.  This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that our employees and contract employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes.  We use this close scrutiny of all changes to help ensure that changes do not adversely impact employees, public safety, or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1 Management of Change Details\n\n\n\nWe analyze each proposed change and confirm that:\n\n\n\n The technical basis for the change is appropriate\n\n The safety and health impacts of the change are understood and appropriate controls are in place\n\n The procedures are modified as appropriate for the change\n\n The permissible time period is established for temporary changes\n\n The change is authorized by appropriate personnel\n\n\n\nOur MOC procedure contains a step-by-step description of the confirmation process.  It defines and provides examples of changes and replacements in kind.  Also, it describes in detail the requirement for each confirmation step based on the type of change being considered.  We use a Request for Change Review and Approval Form to document each step in the confirmation process.  Changes that pass the confirmation criteria are communicated to our employees and contract employees who are affected by the change before the change is implemented.  When approved changes require updates to our process safety information and/or operating procedures, we revise these documents and train employees on these changes before operations resume.  All training is documented as formal operator training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    8.0 PRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.77 of the RMP rule, we perform a pre-startup review as a final check to ensure the safety of a new or modified process before it is placed in service.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1 Pre-Startup Review Details\n\n\n\nWe perform pre-startup reviews on new stationary sources and on modified stationary sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  Our pre-startup review is completed before regulated substances are brought into the process and only after we have confirmed that:\n\n\n\n Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\n Safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate\n\n PHAs have been performed on new stationary sources and all recommendations have been resolved\n\n MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes\n\n Training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees\n\n\n\nWe use a Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form as an aid in documenting the performance of our pre-startup reviews.  Our checklist contains a list of safety questions covering process considerations that must be addressed prior to startup.  The person responsible for the project or maintenance task prepares the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form and provides the names of the reviewer responsible for confirmation of each of the pre-startup review safety questions.  Each reviewer signs off on the checklist and approval form when satisfied that all assigned safety questions are complete and no problems exist.  All reviewers must sign off on the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form before startup can be authorized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    9.0 COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.79 of the RMP rule, we audit our RMP-covered processes to be certain that our prevention programs are effective.  Our compliance audit program seeks to confirm that RMP prevention program practices for the covered process are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1 Compliance Audit Details\n\n\n\nWe conduct and certify compliance audits of the prevention programs for RMP-covered processes at least every three years.  We integrate these audits into PSM audits.  Our audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the size and complexity of the processes to be audited.  The audit team collectively possesses the following skills and knowledge:\n\n\n\n Ability to understand the prevention program requirements of the RMP regulation (49 CFR Part 68)\n\n Capability to conduct interviews and collect audit data\n\n Capability to document audit results\n\n Knowledge of the process to be audited\n\n\n\nOur audit team members receive training in RMP regulatory requirements, interview techniques, and methods for data collection before participating in an audit.  They use a protocol or a checksheet that contains a series of questions that systematically address each requirement of the RMP regulation.  The team leader assigns each auditor specific RMP elements to cover in the audit.  Information obtained through field observations, interviews, and document reviews is documented, and weaknesses or noncompliances are identified.  At the conclusion of the audit, our audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.\n\n\n\nWe have a plant management committee that promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and assigns a target completion date.  The corrective actions are placed in a tracking system and progress is monitored quarterly until open issues are resolved.  We retain the two most recent audit reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    10.0 INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.81 of the RMP rule, we perform incident investigations to help ensure that incidents with catastrophic magnitude or potential are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1 Incident Investigation Details\n\n\n\nWe investigate all incidents (including near misses) that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a large uncontrolled release of a regulated substance, serious injuries to our employees or the public, and/or damage to the environment.  We train our employees to identify occurrences requiring investigation and to notify the appropriate person should such an event occur.  If the incident meets RMP-classification criteria, we initiate an investigation within 48 hours.  We assemble an investigation team consisting of:\n\n\n\n At least one person knowledgeable in the process or activity involved\n\n A contract employee if the incident or near miss incident involved the work of a contractor or had acute, adverse health effects on contract employees\n\n Others with appropriate knowledge and skills to thoroughly investigate and analyze the event  \n\nWe train our investigation team leaders in investigation techniques, including root cause analysis.  The investigation team follows a written investigation protocol that addresses the key steps of fact finding, determination of cause, and development of recommendations/actions to be taken.  From the raw data collected, the incident investigation team prepares the text for an incident summary report, which contains:\n\n\n\n Date and time of the event\n\n Date and time the investigation started\n\n Description of the event\n\n Identification of contributing factors\n\n Recommendations from the investigation\n\n\n\nWe resolve the report recommendations and develop action plans that are tracked to completion.  We review the incident investigation report and action plan items with employees (and contract employees, as appropriate) who work in the affected area and/or perform job tasks relevant to the investigation findings.  We accomplish this review by routing a copy of the approved report to potentially affected employees (and contract employees) and by discussing the event at the next safety meeting.  We retain incident reports for at least five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    11.0 EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.83 of the RMP rule, our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing RMP.\n\n\n\n11.1 Employee Participation Details\n\n\n\nWe have a written employee participation program that meets RMP requirements.  In this document, we describe in detail the many different ways that employees participate in each element of the RMP regulations.  We periodically update this document as changes occur.\n\n\n\nWe consult with the employees and their representatives on ways to improve participation in the RMP.  Periodically, in our safety meetings, we review results of PHAs and resolutions of their recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    12.0 HOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.85 of the RMP rule, we use our hot work permit program to ensure that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near an RMP-covered process.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1 Hot Work Permit Details\n\n\n\nWe studied OSHA's fire prevention and protection regulation 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and developed a procedure that addresses these requirements.  We also created a Hot Work Permit Form to document job requirements, the dates for the hot work, and the object on which the work is to be performed.  We distributed the Hot Work Procedure and Sample Hot Work Permit Forms to employees in safety meetings and used a workshop approach to train all employees who may use or enforce a hot work permit activity.  New maintenance employees are trained on the hot work permit procedure as part of the safe work practices orientation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    13.0 CONTRACTORS\n\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.87 of the RMP rule, we have a contractor screening procedure to help ensure that we hire and use only contractors who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of our plant employees, the public, or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1 Contractor Details\n\n\n\nWe have a detailed contractor safety program that applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to an RMP-covered process.  This program does not apply to contractors providing incidental services that do not influence process safety.\n\n\n\nWe select contractors based on prior site work history and on information that they are required to provide as part of the bid process.  The bid information includes their current safety programs (i.e., safety organization, employee education and training, and accident prevention program) and their prior safety performance (i.e., OSHA injury rates, property loss experience, regulatory compliance history, and worker's compensation insurance experience).  Bidders that do not provide all of the requested information, that do not have the desired skills, or that have an unsatisfactory safety record are dropped from further consideration.  Contractors that meet the minimum safety requirements are then judged on who can do a quality job at the lowest cost.  If a contractor currently working in our plant is under consideration, we review recent safety audits and contact our people on the job site to verify satisfactory job performance before we authorize the purchase order.\n\n\n\nWe provide a safety orientation for Contractor Supervisors before they begin work on site.  (We require these Contractor Supervisors to provide this same safety orientation to their employees who will work in our plant.)  We use the orientation meeting to familiarize contractors with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be working.  We show a videotape that describes (1) the plant's hazardous chemicals, including toxic, fire/explosion, physical, and chemical properties, (2) safe work practices in use at our facility, and (3) actions they must take in the event of a plant emergency.  We provide copies of our Contractor Safety Manual, which contains plant safety rules/policies, safe work practices, a material hazards summary, and an outline of emergency actions for contractors.  We provide MSDSs for our hazardous materials that may affect the contractor work area, copies of plant safe work practices and policies, and emergency response actions associated with the contractor's work.\n\n\n\nWe then take the Contractor Supervisors on a tour of the job site to point out the hazards we discussed in the meeting, introduce our personnel with whom they will communicate, identify break and restricted areas, note locations of alarm boxes, and show where medical attention may be provided.\n\n\n\nWe require our contractors to perform the following tasks to help ensure process safety:\n\n\n\n Train each of their employees in the work practices necessary to safely perform the contracted work\n\n Provide each of their employees with the same safety orientation that we provide for contractors and supervisors\n\n Train each of their employees on our plant's safe work practices\n\n Document that each of their employees has received and understands the training noted above\n\n Ensure that each of their employees follows our plant safety rules and safe work practices\n\n Report to our staff any hazards created or found by their employees at the job site\n\n Provide access and responses to our personnel who may appear at the job site to evaluate contractor safety performance\n\n Provide information on contract employee job site injuries/illnesses to our designated representative",

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\n\n\nAt GEO Specialty Chemical's Plant in Cedartown, GA., we are committed to operating and\n\n\n\nmaintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and\n\n\n\nresponsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and\n\n\n\nemergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the\n\n\n\npublic as well as protection of the environment.  This section of the document provides a brief\n\n\n\noverview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and\n\n\n\nimplemented, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n\n\n An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n\n\n A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n\n\n An overview of our emergency response program\n\n\n\n An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical\n\n\n\nreleases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\n The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n\n\n The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n\n\n\n          2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\n\n\nOur facility produces condensed naphthalene sulfonates under the trade name of LOMAR, alkyl\n\n\n\nnaphthalene sulfonates, defoamers and miscellaneous other organic chemicals.  In all, about 250\n\n\n\ndifferent products are manufactured at the Cedartown plant, using about 250  raw materials.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential\n\n\n\nto cause off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\n\n\nTOXICS\n\n\n\nOleum       "
