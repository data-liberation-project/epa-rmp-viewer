      "SummaryText": "Coastal Products & Chemicals (CP&C) produces chemicals which are used to clarify and purify the public waters of the Southwest.  As part of being a good neighbor to the community it serves with its chemicals, CP&C had implemented a number of policies, procedures and systems to help ensure the chemicals do not adversely effect the outside community.  The following serves as a brief overview of these policies, procedures, and systems.\n\nIn Choctaw Oklahoma, CP&C had a warehouse that serves as a distribution facility for chlorine 2000 lb. containers and 150 lb. cylinders.  These containers and cylinders are distributed to customers in Oklahoma and Northern parts of Texas.  \n\nThe handling of chlorine containers and cylinders in Choctaw Oklahoma gives the potential of effecting the outside community.  It is this chemcial which is the driving force behind the policies, procedures, and systems which govern this facility.  Under OSHA 29CFR1910.119 (Process Safety Management) CP&C developed a thirteen section manual that helps prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic release of chlorine.  Training is one of the most important sections of PSM.  CP&C employees at the Choctaw facility receive 24-hour awareness training.  We have established Environmental Management Inc., to be our first responders at this facility in the event a problem arrises.\n\nCoastal Products & Chemicals Emergency Response Plan (ERP) was updated in 1999.  The ERP is divided into thirteen sections ranging from administration, policies, duties, chemical information, notifications, evacuations, drills and communications.  Drills are an important learning tool for CP&C employees.\n\nAs part of any good analysis, CP&C also wanted to review the worst possible scenario, which might occur, and the impacts it would cause.  With guidance and models from the EPA, CP&C detemined the worst possible scenario would be a total release of a 2000 lb. container of chlorine in a 10-minute period. The effected resident"

      "SummaryText": "ial population would be 2,854.  CP&C believes with its safety procedures in place the likely occurrence of this happening is small.  In addition, with EPA guidance, the alternate case scenario would be the release of 100 pounds of chlorine in twenty minutes.  The effected residential population would be 204.   \n\nAs Coastal Products & Chemicals grows, we are continually looking for new and improved methods to ensure safety of our personnel and our community.  These changes can only occur with continued input and support of our personnel, regulatory agencies, and our community."
