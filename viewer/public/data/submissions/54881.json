Calpine sells electricity to Dow and to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). In addition, the Plant sells steam to Dow and to USS\u001ePOSCO Industries\u00bf nearby steel mill. \r\n1.3.2\tDescription of the Ammonia Storage System\r\nThe Plant is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments, also referred to as the federal RMP and the CalARP Program, due to on-site ammonia storage in excess of the 10,000-pound RMP applicability threshold in a process. The legal authority for the federal RMP program is\u00a0Title 40 of the\u00a0Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. The legal authority for the\u00a0CalARP Program is the California Health and Safety Code (H&SC), Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2 (commencing with Section 25531). The\u00a0California Office of Emergency Services has issued implementation regulations under Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  \r\nThe Plant\u00bfs CalARP-covered process is the ammonia storage system that provides an ammonia source for the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system (stationary source). The SCR unit is required to control air emissions.  The stationary source-covered process consists of one 15,000\u001egallon tank storing a maximum of 12,750 gallons (72,548 pounds) [United States Env"

Table 1-1 provides program applicability of the covered process. Figure 1-1 shows a simplified process flow diagram.  \r\nRefrigerant-grade anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the Plant by truck and loaded into the holding tank, T-2. Ammonia is vaporized by heaters H-2A and H-2B to maintain pressure in T-2. The vaporizers are located underneath the T-2 ammonia tank and each vaporizer has four heating elements. The suction line to the vaporizers is at the bottom of T-2 and the\u00a0return line is located at the top of T-2. There are pressure switches on\u00a0the vaporizer return line that turn on and off each heater. In addition, there are pressure and temperature switches on each heater that provide override protection in case the heaters are blocked in and turned on.  \r\nAmmonia vapor is discharged from T-2 to the ammonia injection skids. The pressurized ammonia vapor from T-2 is reduced to 80 pounds per square inch gage (psig) by a regulator. This pressure drop helps to create a few degrees of superheat in\u00a0the ammonia vapor to keep it from condensing. It\u00a0also acts as a pressure step down for the regulator at the ammonia skid to\u00a0improve flow control.

A mixing tee is provided where the ammonia is injected into the blower air stream. A static mixer is located downstream of the mixing tee to ensure that the ammonia and air are completely mixed.  \r\nThe injection grid consists of twelve 2-inch stainless-steel pipes located upstream of the low-pressure steam section. The 12 pipes are split into six\u00a0pairs. Each pair has an adjusting valve and differential pressure meter. The adjusting valves have been adjusted to compensate for any distribution problems encountered in the SCR system. The injection grid\u00a0is located upstream of the low-pressure steam section to allow for additional mixing of the flue gas and the ammonia. The ammonia is compatible with the carbon steel piping of the low-pressure steam section.  \r\nAt the injection skid, the ammonia flow rate is adjusted to achieve the desired nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission set point. The ammonia is then mixed with blower-supplied air. The ammonia/air mixture is injected into the HRSG upstream of the low-pressure steam section for the units and into a mixing box prior to the catalyst bed for the auxiliary boiler. Turbine exhaust gas that has bypassed the HRSG by going through the bypass duct enters the HRSG downstream of the low-pressure steam section and is mixed with ammonia-laden HRSG flue gas. Combined exhaust streams enter the catalyst bed where the ammonia is deposited on the catalyst. NOx in the flue gas reacts with ammonia on the catalyst surface to form water and nitrogen. A Continuous Emission Monitor (CEM) measures the NOx level of the flue gas leaving the catalyst. This measurement is used by the Tri-sen to adjust the ammonia injection rate and also for reports"

To ensure that hot work is done safely, a hot work permit program must be developed that requires that a permit be issued before hot work is performed.  The site shall utilize hot work permit procedures as defined in SHP-11, Hot Work. The purpose of this section is to summarize the process described in SHP-11 that will be used for hot work permitting at CPPP.  The Hot Work Permit Program has been written  to provide accountability and documentation necessary for ensuring the safe performance of hot work during normal operations, maintenance and construction operations. Hot work permits document that the fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations.  The hot work permits program also applies to any contractor work conducted at this facility.  \r\nThe fire prevention and protect"
