Calpine sells electricity to Dow and to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). In addition, the Plant sells steam to Dow and to USSPOSCO Industries? nearby steel mill. \n\n1.3.2    Description of the Ammonia Storage System\n\nThe Plant is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments, also referred to as the federal RMP and the CalARP Program, due to on-site ammonia storage in excess of the 10,000-pound RMP applicability threshold in a process. The legal authority for the federal RMP program is Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. The legal authority for the CalARP Program is the California Health and Safety Code (H&SC), Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2 (commencing with Section 25531). The California Office of Emergency Services has issued implementation regulations under Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  \n\nThe Plant?s CalARP-covered process is the ammonia storage system that provides an ammonia source for the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system (stationary source). The SCR unit is required to control air emissions.  The stationary source-covered process consists of one 15,000gallon tank storing a maximum of 12,750 gallons (72,548 pounds) [United States Env"

Table 1-1 provides program applicability of the covered process. Figure 1-1 shows a simplified process flow diagram.  \n\nRefrigerant-grade anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the Plant by truck and loaded into the holding tank, T-2. Ammonia is vaporized by heaters H-2A and H-2B to maintain pressure in T-2. The vaporizers are located underneath the T-2 ammonia tank and each vaporizer has four heating elements. The suction line to the vaporizers is at the bottom of T-2 and the return line is located at the top of T-2. There are pressure switches on the vaporizer return line that turn on and off each heater. In addition, there are pressure and temperature switches on each heater that provide override protection in case the heaters are blocked in and turned on.  \n\nAmmonia vapor is discharged from T-2 to the ammonia injection skids. The pressurized ammonia vapor from T-2 is reduced to 80 pounds per square inch gage (psig) by a regulator. This pressure drop helps to create a few degrees of superheat in the ammonia vapor to keep it from condensing. It also acts as a pressure step down for the regulator at the ammonia skid to improve flow control. Steam tracing is provided along the ammonia line from the regulator to the skid to ensure that the ammonia in the line always stays vaporized. \n\nThe major components of the injection skid include blowers C1/2/3-A/B for the turbine units and blowers 103/104 for the auxiliary boiler, a flow control meter and valve, a mixing tee, a static mixer, and an injection grid. The blowers provide the air that is to be mixed with the ammonia prior to injection into the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG). The mass flow meter is located on the ammonia injection skid to measure ammonia flow to the unit. This signal goes to the flow controller algorithm in a Tri-sen fuel controller for the units "

An automatic block valve is located downstream of the control valve. Both valves are operated by the Tri-sen fuel control for the units and by the Allen Bradley controller for the auxiliary boiler. A mixing tee is provided where the ammonia is injected into the blower air stream. A static mixer is located downstream of the mixing tee to ensure that the ammonia and air are completely mixed.  \n\nThe injection grid consists of twelve 2-inch stainless-steel pipes located upstream of the low-pressure steam section. The 12 pipes are split into six pairs. Each pair has an adjusting valve and differential pressure meter. The adjusting valves have been adjusted to compensate for any distribution problems encountered in the SCR system. The injection grid is located upstream of the low-pressure steam section to allow for additional mixing of the flue gas and the ammonia. The ammonia is compatible with the carbon steel piping of the low-pressure steam section.  \n\nAt the injection skid, the ammonia flow rate is adjusted to achieve the desired nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission set point. The ammonia is then mixed with blower-supplied air. The ammonia/air mixture is injected into the HRSG upstream of the low-pressure steam section for the units and into a mixing box prior to the catalyst bed for the auxiliary boiler. Turbine exhaust gas that has bypassed the HRSG by going through the bypass duct enters the HRSG downstream of the low-pressure steam section and is mixed with ammonia-laden HRSG flue gas. Combined exhaust streams enter the catalyst bed where the ammonia is deposited on the catalyst. NOx in the flue gas reacts with ammonia on the catalyst surface to form water and nitrogen. A Continuous Emission Monitor (CEM) measures the NOx level of the flue gas leaving the catalyst. This measurement is used by the Tri-sen to adjust the ammonia injection rate and also for reports "

The Plant facility, under ownership of Dow, performed a PHA on the ammonia storage vessel with the objectives of: \n\n* Identifying hazards;\n\n* Identifying credible human errors and/or equipment failures that could lead to any accidental release;\n\n* Evaluating the likelihood and/or consequence of various scenarios;\n\n* Determining if existing chemical-specific prevention steps/controls were adequate; and \n\n* Where existing controls were inadequate, identifying additional steps that could be taken to control the hazard.\n\nIn accordance with Section 2760 of the CalARP regulations, the Plant consulted with CCCHSD and determined that the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methodology was the approach best-suited for the PHA of the ammonia storage vessel.  This methodology was chosen due to the relatively complex design of the ammonia storage and transfer system, as well as the facility?s belief that HAZOPs provide a high level of detail for analysis of this system.  The HAZOP methodology, in addition to all other policies, procedures and operations, was adopted by Calpine upon acquisition of CPPP. \n\nA HAZOP study is a simple, structured methodology for hazard identification.

A revalidation of the PHA was performed in July 2007.\n\nRecommendations or action items identified during a PHA are documented and resolved through the application of MOC procedures.  The MOC procedures are also used to revalidate and update the PHA procedures.  Currently, there have been no changes as a result of the PHA process.
