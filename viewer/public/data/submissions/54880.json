This \r\nprocess combines monomers along with other chemicals in a specified vessel to form the \r\nfinished adhesive product.  \r\n\r\n2.0\tRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nVinyl acetate monomer (VAM) is the only chemical listed in the Clean Air Act 112 (r) \r\nand used above its threshold value at this site.  VAM is transported to the site primarily \r\nthrough railcars and, occasionally, tanker trucks.  Two dedicated tanks located within a \r\nsecondary containment are used to store the VAM.  This raw material is introduced into \r\nthe process through piping, pumps, and intermediate vessels prior to being metered into \r\nthe reactors where it is polymerized into the finished product.\r\n\r\n3.0\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nChemical releases are minimized through a variety of means including operator training, \r\nequipment design and installation, initial startup, operating procedures, and maintenance \r\nprocedures.  It is the policy of the Blue Ash facility to identify the potential for chemical \r\nreleases and address their causes.  In the unlikely event a release occurs the facility \r\npersonnel are trained in operational parameters to minimize the effects without \r\ncompromising their own safety.\r\n\r\n4.0\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\r\n\r\nThis facility has taken the steps identified in 40 CFR 68 to reduce or minimize the effects \r\nof any accidental release.  These processes which use VAM are also subject to the \r\nrequirements of the Process Safety Management regulations found in 29 CFR 1910.119.  \r\nThe following paragraphs briefly describe the current release prevention program for the \r\nprocess which polymerizes VAM.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThis information describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment \r\ndesign for the associated processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis"

      "SummaryText": "This is a systematic review of the process by a cross functional team used to ensure the \r\nhazards of the process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used in \r\nthese analyses is the HAZOP technique.  The identified recommendations are reviewed, \r\nprioritized and implemented in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nOperating procedures are used to safely produce products in an effective and repeatable \r\nmanner.  These procedures address the  various stages of the operation including initial \r\nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal \r\nshutdown, emergency shutdown, process sequencing, and startup after a shutdown.  The \r\nprocedures are periodically reviewed and are readily accessible to the operators.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nMaintenance of the equipment requires a variety of methodology.  Testing and studies are \r\nperformed equipment such as vessels and piping to determine that it continues to meet its \r\ndesign capabilities; inspections are performed on devices such as rupture disks and vents \r\nto ensure they are operational; periodic maintenance is used on that equipment (pumps, \r\ncontrols, valves, etc.) which is used regularly.  Qualified personnel are used to perform \r\nthese maintenance operations.  Should a deficiency be identified during any one of these \r\nprocesses it is addressed in a timely and safe manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nChanges in the process are proposed, described, and reviewed with through written \r\nprocedures.  Changes can be a change in chemical, technology, equipment or procedure.  \r\nThose affected by the change are notified and trained, if necessary.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Review\r\nPrior to a new process startup the installation, equipment, operating and maintenance \r\nprocedures are reviewed to ensure they are suitable for safe operations.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audit\r\nAudits are used to identify any shortcomings in the existing program in comparison to the \r\nregulations and allow for contin"
