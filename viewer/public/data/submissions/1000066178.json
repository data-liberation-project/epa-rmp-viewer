Two Rivers Terminal receives anhydrous ammonia by railcar. The railcar is temporarily parked on the Facilities rail spur or property in anticipation of the anhydrous ammonia being reacted by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (See Fertilizer Reacting Process). It is anticipated that a single 34,000-gallon railcar would be delivered for reacting. The Facility Manager implements the Risk Management Program while the railcar is parked on the Facility property, at break times during the reacting process, and when the\n\nreaction process is complete and residual anhydrous ammonia may remain in the railcar. The Risk Management Program includes an Accident Prevention Program/PSM that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractor requirements.",

The IFRC is responsible to Two Rivers Terminal for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation when its equipment is connected to the railcar. At a minimum, the IFRC must (1) have in place and certify compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management Plan (PSM), (2) make available to Two Rivers Terminal and EPA upon request any documentation necessary to comply with the PSM and RMP, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading and reactor operations and that its PSM support programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. The Two Rivers Terminal Safety Manager is responsible for evaluating the IFRC's past performance under the PSM program. Further, Two Rivers Terminal will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its IFRC for review and implementation of emergency notifications procedures and a copy of its PSM/RMP Program Document upon request.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Two Rivers Terminal, LLC (Two Rivers Terminal) Pasco Facility (A.K.A. Selph Landing) has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of\n\nanhydrous ammonia from the Pasco Facility located at 1910 Selph Landing Rd, Pasco, WA 99301. The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Pasco Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Pasco Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and\n\ntimely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nTwo Rivers Terminal filed its First Time Submission of the RMP registration with EPA in August 2011, and before operations began.  During a recent EPA Audit (9/15/17), Two Rivers Terminal discovered that it had made a typographical error when entering the Physical Address (i.e. 1670 vs. 1910 Selph Landing, Pasco, WA 99301) on the First Time Submission.  Two Rivers Terminal is filing this First Time Submission to correct the physical address.  Both the EPA RMP and the RMP Manaul have been updated to reflect this change.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Pasco Facility is an agricultural chemical blending and distribution facility. Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via railcar that is temporarily stored on the property until the anhydrous ammonia is reacted with phosphoric acid in a mobile pipe reactor and then diluted with water. Two Rivers Terminal does not own or operate the reacting process. The reacting process and ancillary railcar unloading procedures are performed by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC). After the reacting process is complete, any residual anhydrous ammonia is stored in the railcar until the railcar owner re"

      "SummaryText": "moves the railcar from the Two Rivers Terminal Facility.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for both the ammonia storage process and the reacting process. The worst case release scenario is the same for the both the ammonia storage and the reacting process. The worst case scenario release for the Pasco Facility assumes that all the contents of the largest single vessel (a single railcar) are released. The release was modeled as if the railcar was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet. \n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are different for the two processes. The ammonia storage alternative consequence analysis assumed that a vapor valve is leaking or is not fully closed. The reacting process alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 2-inch liquid transfer hose is severed during the reacting process.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Facility Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Two Rivers Terminal Facility. The Facility Manager is assisted by other Two Rivers Terminal staff, as directed. The ammonia storage prevention program is implemented by Two Rivers Terminal employees. Two Rivers Terminal employees inspect the markings on railcar to ensure that the railcar is operated within the U.S. DOT required inspection requirements and they inspect the Bill of Lading to ensure that the railcar is not overfilled. Two Rivers Terminal employees also inspect the railcar for leaking valves and fittings when receiving, during storage, and when releasing the railcar.\n\n\n\nThe reacting process prevention program is implemented by the IFRC because Two Rivers Terminal does not own or operate the reacting process. Two Rivers Terminal requires the IFRC to certify its compliance with a Process Safety Management Plan and it reviews the contractor's PSM documentation (e.g. maint"

Two Rivers Terminal has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department. Two Rivers Terminal has a written Contingency Plan that includes procedures to notify local emergency response agencies in event of a significant ammonia release. Two Rivers Terminal employees will not, under any circumstance, serve as first responders to a significant release of \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Pasco Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Two Rivers Terminal at the Pasco Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Pasco Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Franklin County LEPC.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Pasco Facility."
