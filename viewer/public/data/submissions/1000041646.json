GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM and CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS- The Russell Stephenson WWTF is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68. The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule. A process hazard analysis was conducted at this facility using a what-if analysis. Process controls in use include a vent, relief valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, alarms and procedures, and emergency power. Mitigation systems in use includes enclosure of the chlorinator system. Monitoring/detection systems include a process area detector.
