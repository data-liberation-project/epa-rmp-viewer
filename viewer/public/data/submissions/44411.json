      "SummaryText": "investigation and follow-up procedures \n\nRelease Scenario Data\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is the failure of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank assuming complete loss of the tank contents in a 10-minute period.  This scenario results in the release of approximately 127,491 pounds of ammonia. The distance to the toxic endpoint is approximately 7.8 km or 4.8 miles and may affect approximately 56,464 individuals within the zone of impact radius in accordance to Landview 6.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the rupture of the railcar unloading hose with the spill contents being discharged to existing ground surfaces. This scenario results in the release of approximately 420 pounds of ammonia. The distance to the toxic endpoint is 200 m.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for aqua ammonia assumes release of the entire contents of one 20,000-gallon storage tank.  This scenario results in the release of approximately 10,000 pounds of aqua ammonia.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is approximately 2.6 km or 1.6 miles and may affect approximately 60 individuals within the zone of impact radius in accordance to Landview 6.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for aqua ammonia was rupture of the unloading hose.  This scenario results in the release of approximately 56 pounds of aqua ammonia.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 54 m and will likely not affect any individuals within the impact radius.\n\nThe piping and distribution network for anhydrous and aqua ammonia is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves, which effectively limit the amount and duration of any accidental release. In addition, the tank areas are equipped with emergency eyewash and safety showers.  The pesticides are stored within a warehouse, which will contain a liquid release of pesticide and control the dispersion.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is comprised of the following elements:\n\n* Proper maintenance of all system equipment.\n\n* Proper oper"

The Dixon Fire Department will be the first responder in an ammonia emergency.  Tremont Group personnel will perform \"awareness\" duties only, which simply means that once the ammonia spill or release is discovered, Tremont Group personnel will make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. In the event of a major release, The Tremont Group may join forces with Dixon FD and State/County OES personnel in a \"unified command effort\" until the emergency has been mitigated.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Elements\n\nChemical specific prevention measures are summarized as follows:\n\n* Periodic inspection of ammonia tank, containment area, pumps, and piping network.\n\n* Monitoring of anhydrous ammonia storage tank and system pressures and temperatures.\n\n* Monitoring of unloading/delivery procedures.\n\n* Provide all required safety and response equipment.\n\n* Provide a chemical specific training program.\n\n* Access to The Tremont Group Dixon Facility is controlled, and the facility is fenced.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    Presently, The Tremont Group is operating a number of similar facilities in Northern California.

The following data is typically gathered by the incident investigation team subsequent to the incident:\n\n* Date and time of the ?incident? or ?near miss?\n\n* Timeliness of incident report to the responding agency\n\n* Timeliness of public awareness and/or evacuation measures\n\n* Description of the incident or ?near miss?\n\n* An evaluation of the events that resulted in the incident or ?near miss?\n\n* Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the incident\n\nThe incident investigation policy is delineated in the safety procedures. The investigation results, including the implementation of all recommendations, are reviewed with facility staff whose job responsibilities are relevant to the findings. Copies of the investigation reports are maintained on site for a minimum of five years, and are used during the periodic PHA re-evaluations.\n\nRMP Change Management\n\nOperati"

      "SummaryText": "onal, safety, and environmental issues must be addressed whenever a change occurs at a facility, which involves an affected process or substance. Quite often a change made in one aspect of the process may affect other parts of the process due to facility system integration. Such changes must be reviewed prior to initiation, to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The facility RMPCM procedures are used to evaluate all changes to the following types of systems:\n\n* Process chemicals (delivery, storage, handling)\n\n* Control technology systems (operation rates, chemicals used, by-products or wastes produced)\n\n* Equipment design and construction\n\n* Operations and maintenance procedures\n\n* Other changes to facility equipment or processes\n\nThe current RMPCM procedures, developed by The Tremont Group and Dixon facility staff, are used for the Dixon facility to track changes in equipment or processes as identified or planned by facility personnel. Facility staff evaluate the potential impact(s) of the change on operational safety and worker health via a checklist for minor changes or a design review for major changes. The following steps are taken to ensure the safe implementation of the change.\n\n* Prior to startup, process safety information is updated as required. Revised process safety information is placed in the operations, safety, and maintenance manuals.\n\n* Operating procedures are revised in accordance with the new or modified equipment or process design and operations specifications. Updated procedures are placed in the appropriate operations, safety, and maintenance manuals.\n\n* Employees affected by the change (job classification basis) receive training in accordance with the specific training program prior to startup of the process. The employees training records are updated.\n\nThe operations staff, in conjunction with the RMP team, is responsible f"
