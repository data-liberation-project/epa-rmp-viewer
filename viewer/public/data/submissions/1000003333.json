Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 15 states.  Fifteen processing facilities produce about 56 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 12 largest US grain companies.  In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\nThe Perdue Farms Milford Food Plant (P-1318) is located at 255 North Rehoboth Boulevard, Milford, Delaware. This facility processes broilers (fryers) and other valued-added poultry products.  Perdue Farms purchased this facility and started operations in October 1995.  The facility is sited on about 25 acres, on the north side of town, east of Route 113.  It is bounded by some residences, industries and farmland.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is onsite and is regulated under CFR Part 68.  It is used for refrigeration. The Perdue Milford facility has one system containing 26,785 pounds of ammonia.  It is distributed throughout the components  (compressors, condensers, evaporators, etc.).  The system has equipment both inside and outside of the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Perdue facilities are located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously. All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe working conditions and safe practices.  PerdueA?s policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to "

The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Vice President of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to its staff.\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program\nPerdue Milford has complied with DelawareA?s Extremely Hazardous Substance Risk Management Act (EHSRMA) since its promulgation in 1989 and the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 of 1992.  Up-to-date process information, such as equipment information, piping and instrument diagrams and Material Safety Data Sheets, are kept onsite.  Employee participation includes operation and maintenance procedures development, review and training.  Contractors are required to submit qualification statements of competency.  Process hazard analyses with recommendations have been done, and corrective actions taken. Annual mechanical integrity inspections are scheduled.  In addition, Perdue performs internal audits on its PSM substances. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no on-site accidents involving ammonia at the Perdue Milford facility that have resulted in death, injuries, property damage or environmental damage.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\nPerdue Milford has implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM regulations.

The State of Delaware and DEMA (Delaware Emergency Management Agency) have instituted the First Alert Telephone Notification System that allows for a A?reverse 911A? procedure for notification of communities in the event of a chemical release or other emergency.   The system can be activated by the Fire Company Incident Commander, Manager of Kent LEPC or the SERT (State Emergency Response Team).\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThere are two RETA (Refrigeration Engineering Technician Association) Level A Certified operators at the facility.  Perdue continues its five-year PRV replacement program. In April 2009 a new rechiller was installed.  We have replaced new oil pots on all four recirculators.  Have improved the relief valve discharge pipes.  A new ammonia detection system was installed that expanded the protection area.  In 2008 a new hazwoper trailer was bought and supplied with new equipment.  There was a new condenser bought and installed during the 2008 year.  Also during 2008 a new condenser coil was installed. A  cell phone was issued to improve on-site communications with operator to management.\nAs part of Perdue FarmsA? continual improvement philosophy, the Perdue M"
