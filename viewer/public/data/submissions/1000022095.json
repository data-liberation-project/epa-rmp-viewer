      "SummaryText": "FNG Lake Wales: RMP Executive Summary\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\nCitrus World, Inc. d.b.a. Florida's Natural Growers is a citrus juice processing and packaging facility (NAICS Code 311411) using one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the facility's refrigeration process.  The refrigeration process is an integral part of processing, storing and preserving the facility's juice products.\n \nFresh citrus fruit arrives at the facility via trucks from local citrus growers during the normal citrus harvesting season.  Juice is extracted from the fruit and held in chilled storage for processing and packaging.  The juice is then processed and packaged into finished product and stored in chilled warehouses to await shipment to customers.\n\nThe facility's refrigeration process is divided into three separate systems.  The largest of the three systems (Process 1) provides refrigeration for the processing and packing functions at the facility.  This system has a maximum intended inventory of the regulated substance above the threshold quantity.  The second and third systems provide refrigeration for the facility's chilled warehouse space.  The second system's (Process 2) maximum intended inventory is also above the threshold quantity, however the third system's inventory is below the threshold quantity.  All three systems are operated and maintained to the same level of safety and in compliance with Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Procedures:\nThe facility has proactive safety programs, including an extensive Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.  The facility works diligently to provide a safe working environment for its employees and to prevent any accidental release of the regulated substance that may impact the faci"

The facility's ARP program combines and satisfies both the requirements of RMP and PSM.\n\nThe ARP program ensures that the processes are designed, installed, maintained, modified and operated in a safe manner.  Participation by the facility's employees is a key ingredient in the development, implementation and maintenance of each of the ARP program's elements.  The program elements include policies and procedures regarding employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training employees on procedures, contractors' safety, pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, permitting for hot work, management of process changes, emergency planning and response, compliance audits and offsite consequence analysis.\n\nTrained employees perform routine monitoring and maintenance of the systems to ensure that system deviations are quickly addressed.  All employees and contractors that work on or around the covered process are trained in the hazards of the processes.  Contractors are pre-approved by the Safety Department to ensure safe work standards are followed at any work site within the facility.\n\nThe facility has installed safety devices to reduce the risk of an accidental release of the regulated substance and to minimize the impact should an accidental release occur.   One of the safety devices is an automated control system that can automatically shutdown the system in the event of a system deviation that may result in a release.  Another safety feature of the facility's process is an ammonia leak detection system with sensors installed throughout key areas of the facility to provide early warning of a release.  The detection system is connected to a control system, which sounds an alarm to notify employees.  The facility has also installed a public address and alarm system to notify employees of a plant evacuation in the event it is required.\n\nEmergency Response Policies and Procedures:\nTh"

      "SummaryText": "e facility has implemented an Emergency Contingency Plan in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38 and disseminated to facility personnel.  The facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  The facility's emergency contingency plan consists of employee notification (alarm) and evacuation, followed by notification of the appropriate local and national emergency agencies.  A facility evacuation plan has been developed, disseminated to facility employees and included in the Emergency Contingency Plan documentation.\n\nThe facility has established an Emergency Response Team (ERT) to assist refrigeration personnel in containing an accidental release of ammonia.  ERT members and refrigeration personnel receive hazardous material training to the technician level in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(iii) and key management personnel receive hazardous material training to the incident commander level in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 (q)(v).  \n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThe facility has had no accidental releases in the past five years.   The facility has not had any accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, significant property damage, off-site injuries, off-site property damage or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Process Safety Improvements:\nThe facility is continuously refining its safety and ARP programs.  The facility routinely holds process safety management meetings to discuss results of mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigations and proposed changes to the process.  \n\nFuture plans at the facility to improve process safety include installation of additional ammonia detection systems in the processing and warehousing areas of the facility.  The facility also plans to streamline systems and removing excess piping and equipment to reduce the maximum intended inventory of the regulated substance.  Control system and procedure improvements are in development and are to be implemented in the near future."
