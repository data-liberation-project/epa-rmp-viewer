Spent geothermal fluid is injected back into the subsurface reservoir via three injection wells.\r\n\r\nWild Rose is operated by Ormat's Eastern Nevada Operations Group (ENOP). ENOP is comprised of management, administration, maintenance, engineering and operations personnel.  They operate three eastern Nevada power generation facilities owned by Ormat in addition to Wild Rose.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Rose facility operates continuously, 24 hours per day and 365 days per year (excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or plant upsets).  During the initial startup phase, the plant is staffed full time, but will eventually be operated remotely from the McGinness Hills Geothermal Power Plant Control Room, which is central to all ENOP-operated facilities.  During remote operation, two full time employees will be dedicated to provide routine field monitoring and preventative maintenance.  12 additional part time employees will provide the equivalent of four more full time employees to bring the total number of full time employees to six.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substance Handled\r\nWild Rose utilizes n-butane (CAS # 106-97-8) as the motive fluid in the OEC unit. In addition to the inventory present in the OEC, the plant has three n-butane storage tanks.  Each tank has a nominal capacity of 36,000 gallons each (maximum fill capacity of 32,400 gallons).  The maximum total projected amount of n-butane to be stored on site is 530,878 pounds (reflects the inventory in the operational OEC and one storage tank containing two, full truck-loads of n-butane which is approximately 18,000 gallons). The use of n-butane in a process in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires compliance with PSM (29CFR1910.119), RMP (40CFR68) and CAPP (Nevada Administrative Code 459.952 to 459.95528).  The n-butane is projected to first be stored on the site in November, 2013.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been"

However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been initiated at the Wild Rose\r\nfacility. The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC system at Wild Rose. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals.\r\n\r\nAlarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufacturer's recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices. The Standard Maintenance Procedures (SMP's) will identify system maintenance procedures, frequencies and recommended spare parts.\r\n\r\nTraining: Initial training for personnel is given before that employee is allowed to either handle n-butane,\r\noperate or work in the facility's process area or on process equipment.

Contracted employees, shall be trained in the requirements of the EAP procedure prior to working at the Wild Rose site. Training will include the following items, but is not limited to: (a) Location and sounds of the stand down, and evacuation alarms; (b) Expectations of response to injuries and emergencies by personnel on site; and (c) Evacuation routes and locations. Refresher training for all personnel shall be conducted annually at a minimum.\r\n\r\nSafety Training: Some equipment at the Wild Rose Geothermal Power Plant poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include Emergency Action Plan (EAP), motive fluid hazards, fire prevention and hot work, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, confined space, hearing conservation, personal protective equipment, accident, injury and incident reporting. Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Standard Safety Procedures.\r\n\r\nn-butane system: Deviation from the design limits of operation for the n-butane transfer system will not normally occur since the individual components are rated beyond the highest achievable values of pressure, temperature, and flow within the system.\r\n\r\nOEC Unit: The OEC unit is controlled and monitored by its own dedicated Programmable Logic\r\nController (PLC).

All parameters needed for proper operation of the OEC units, such as pressure, temperature, voltage, current, power, speed, etc. are measured by the proper measuring instruments. Deviation from the operating parameters will immediately be detected by the PLC and the PLC will initiate correction or automatic shutdown of the related OEC unit. Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. Appropriate manual override is provided.\r\n\r\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the n-butane storage tanks and on the OEC vaporizers and condensers. Each pressure relief valve relieves directly to atmosphere. Additionally, each pressure relief valve is installed immediately above a rupture disk designed to fail at the relief pressure of its corresponding relief valve. Individual relief valve locations are equipped with \"telltale\" gauges in between the relief valve and its rupture disk to allow easy identification of leaking or blown rupture disks. The following list summarizes the system relief set points:\r\n\r\n  n-butane Storage Tank Relief: 120 psig\r\n  Condenser: 120 psig\r\n  Vaporizer: 400 psig\r\n\r\nVentilation System Design: All components of the n-butane transfer and storage systems and the OEC units are located outdoors.\r\n\r\nSafety Systems: Beyond the relief system the Wild Rose, the OEC unit has extensive fire protection, gas and flame detection, and alarm systems.
