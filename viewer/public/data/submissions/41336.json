Tyco Healthcare will develop, manufacture, use, distribute, and dispose of chemical products safely and in a manner that ensures protection of health and the environment.

The facility is located on a 40-acre parcel in St. Louis, MO and is comprised of about 50 buildings containing manufacturing operations, research and development, utility services, and warehousing.\n\nThe EPA-regulated product is chlorine. Chlorine is utilized to manufacture the contract media agents.  Chlorine is staged and then delivered one cylinder at a time for usage in a reaction to manufacture the contrast media.\n\n\nKEY OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS PROGRAMS\n\nThe models were run using EPA's RMP offsite consequence analysis guide (OCAG) for toxics.  In the worst case scenarios, a catastrophic failure of one of the cylinders over a ten minute duration was considered and modeled at a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec in \"F\" class atmospheric conditions.\n\nToxics\nWorst Case Release Scenario -Chlorine  \nThe worst case release scenario is considered to be a catastrophic failure of one chlorine cylinder releasing the entire inventory of that cylinder.  The cylinder discharges it's entire 2000 lb. quantity in 10 minutes.  No emergency response is enacted, no safety devices function, and all of the material evaporates.  The EPA modeling techniques indicate a plume extending up to 1.3 miles for 2000 lbs. of chlorine released.  There are approximately 14,000 residents in the included area.  Only a fraction of these residents would be affected in this unlikely event due to plume effects.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - Chlorine\nA rupture disc leaks due to mechanical failure.  The release continues for 60 minutes until the emergency response team responds with the emergency response chlorine repair kit.   2000 lbs are released.  The release plume is substantively reduced through the efforts of the response team, in combination with monitor nozzles.  The potentially effected radius under \"D\" class conditions and average temperatures is 0.2 mile.  There "

There have been no incidents which have involved deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on or off-site, and there are no instances of adverse impact to the employees, community, or the environment in the past five years.\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nMallinckrodt Tyco/Healthcare has a robust emergency response program that includes administrative and operational response procedures, training, and drills.  The program meets the requirements of OSHA and EPA for protection of the safety of our employees and the community and provides for the protection of the environment.    Our emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  This program includes interface with the LEPC and St. Louis St. Fire Department and has been audited by state and federal agencies many times.  Mallinckrodt Tyco Healthcare works closely with the local response organizations, has included representatives as drill observers, and supports responder training through the loan of equipment and facilities for training purposes.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMallinckrodt/Tyco Healthcare uses a variety of means to prevent accidental releases.  These include written procedures and training, preventive maintenance, change management and permitting procedures, incident investigations, inspections, audits and drills.  Furthermore, there are many engineering controls in place that include, automatic shutdown systems, pressure relief systems, spill containment, and water and foam vapor suppression systems that provide multiple layers of protection. Active process safety engineering practices, various internal leadership teams and audits by corporate, local, state, and federal agencies further insure an environ"
