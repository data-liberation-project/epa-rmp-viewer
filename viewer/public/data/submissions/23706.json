      "SummaryText": "1.0 SOURCE\nThe Jennie-O Foods West Central Turkey, Inc. (JOWCT) facility in Pelican Rapids, Minnesota is a processing facility consisting of the slaughter, evisceration, deboning, blending, stuffing, cooking, packaging, warehousing and shipping of turkey.  The JOWCT facility is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulations (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for turkey processing and packaging.  The entire system contains approximately 105,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high-pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 13,500 pounds of liquid ammonia, assuming a 90 percent fill volume.  However, during typical operation, the vessel holds only 3,400 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers and some piping are located outdoors.  \n\n2.0 POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nAs required by the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative-case release) were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the ammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (the \"Model Plan\"), dated May 2000.  \n\n2.1 Worst-case Release\nThe worst-case release is defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the contents of the largest vessel and associated piping (approximately 13,500 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the \"Model Plan\" and assuming the facility is"

      "SummaryText": " located in a rural area, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release extends beyond the facility boundary.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the high pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs annually by a Hartford Steam Boiler and Insurance Company's inspector.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with dual safety relief valves (SRVs) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRVs continued to function.  Actuation of the SRVs would result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative release scenario.  The SRVs are replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\n* An ammonia detector exists in the compressor room;\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessels;\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated b"

Because the building can serve as a passive mitigator to this release, passive mitigation was used to reduce the release rate or the distance to the endpoint.\n\nUsing the specified meteorology contained in the \"Model Plan\", the distance to the endpoint for the \"more likely\" release scenario extends beyond the facility boundary.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system;\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and\n* The facility has emergency response procedures, which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing isolation valves in the liquid lines.\n\n3.0 PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios described in Section 2.0.

The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n* The development of an employee participation program, which includes JOWCT facility employees from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using a \"What-If\" Analysis.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  Since the initial PHA, significant modifications to the system have also triggered a formal PHA.  The PHAs have resulted in recommendations to improve the safety and operation of the refrigeration system.  The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\n* Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards part"

This includes regular inspection of major powered equipment, including compressors, pumps and large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechanical failure. The program also includes regular inspection and calibration of liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches and shutdown devices that have safety implications.\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\n* Events that might cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\n* Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\n* Planning with the local fire department to ensure a rapid response to potential incidents with the system or external events, such as floods or tornadoes.\n* Prevention program compliance audits are performed every three years to veri"
