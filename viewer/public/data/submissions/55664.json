This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System and the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System.  The facility\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n2.\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored at the site. The facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity to 85% of the fill capacity for both covered processes. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 243,100 pounds.\nAqua ammonia (20% of ammonia by weight) is stored in eight above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 477,000 gallons of solution. The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 20% active ingredient by weight, is 734,580 pounds. \n \n3.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and one worst case has been defined for the Aqueous Ammonia Storage.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and one alternative case has been defined for the Aqu"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation  \nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an anhydrous or aqueous ammonia release.  The facility utilizes a pressure relief valve, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutdown systems.  The facility also only stores anhydrous ammonia during a brief period of the year when conversion is taking place.  During most of the year, there is no anhydrous ammonia onsite. \n \n4.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 2 and Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. Prevention elements for each program are listed below.\n\nAqueous Ammonia Storage Prevention Program 2 Elements\n2755.1\tSafety Information\n2755.2\tHazard Review\n2755.3\tOperating Procedures\n2755.4\tTraining\n2755.5\tMaintenance\n2755.6\tCompliance Audits\n2755.7\tIncident Investigation\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Storage Prevention Program 3 Elements\n2760.1\tProcess Safety Information\n2760.2\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n2760.3\tOperating Procedures\n2760.4\tTrain"
