      "SummaryText": "American Spraytech owns the facility located at 25 ImClone in Branchburg, NJ. The previous owner, Falcon Safety Products, stopped their operations in September 2023. Please note that the facility is NOT CURRENTLY IN OPERATION. All chemical tanks have been emptied and there are no regulated substances under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act present in quantities above their thresholds. The dates of audits, PHA updates, and other required compliance dates have not been changed since last submittal, but all occurred within 5 years of the stopping of Falcon\u0092s operations.\n\nWhile not subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program per 40 CFR Part 68, American Spraytech, with guidance from the USEPA and NJDEP, have made the determination to re-submit the RMP for 25 ImClone instead of terminating it. This is due to two major reasons: (1) American Spraytech plans to restart operations in the second quarter of 2025 (2025 Q2), and (2) there would be a lengthy application and approval process to issue a new NJRMP, per NJDEP TCPA regulations.\n\nTherefore, American Spraytech is re-submitting the RMP with hazardous substance quantities estimated for when operations begin. The basic operation of the facility, including quantity and types of chemicals used (difluoroethane), storage systems, and safety equipment is currently predicted to be similar to Falcon Safety Products\u0092 operation.\n\nOnce exact chemical quantities and systems are finalized, American Spraytech will re-submit this RMP with updated information, including PHAs, emergency response protocols, and all other items listed below.\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention Policies:\nIn addition to 25 ImClone, American Spraytech also owns and operates facilities located at 181 and 205 Meister Avenue in Branchburg, NJ which are currently subject to the RMP requirements of Part 68. The facilities handle Liquefied Petroleum Gases (propane, isobutane, normal butane, difluoroethane and methyl ether) that are considered hazardou"

      "SummaryText": "s by the EPA. These are flammable gases, so it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent human exposure and reduce health threats to our workers and the nearby community.\n\nCurrently the 25 ImClone facility is NOT IN OPERATION. Before operations resume (predicted 2025 Q2), the 25 ImClone facility will develop and implement a comprehensive accidental release prevention program compliant consistent with other American Spraytech facilities.\n\nSafety depends on:\n(1) The manner in which we handle these products;\n(2) The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility;\n(3) Operating and maintenance procedures; and\n(4) Employee training. The President has overall authority for the safety program at the Branchburg facility.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances handled: Currently there are no regulated substances handled. Beginning 2025 Q2 (estimated), the primary purpose of this facility will be to receive and store Liquefied Petroleum Gases (difluoroethane) and then use these materials as propellants in aerosol containers. These Liquefied Petroleum Gases are the only materials that will be handled at the facility that are subject to the EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps: The facility had developed a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the hydrocarbon systems that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation. Currently the facility is not in operation. When operations begin (2025 Q2 estimated), all elements of the prevention program, including specific prevention steps, will be re-evaluated and updated.\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n(1) Employee Participation Program\n(2) Process Safety Information\n(3) Process Hazard Analysis\n(4) Operating Procedures\n(5) Training Program\n(6) Contractor Safety Program\n(7) Pre-Startup Safety Review Pr"

Five-Year Accident History There have not been any accidents in the previous five years at the Branchburg facility that resulted in significant onsite or offsite consequences.\n\n5. The Emergence Action Program: The emergency action plan for this facility, once in operation, will consist of evacuating personnel to a designated assembly area. Our emergency action plan will detail employee actions and includes procedures for notification of the local Fire Department and the local LEPC. If the release is beyond the capabilities of facility personnel, representatives from the Fire Department would be called to respond to the incident. The emergency action plan, once finalized prior to beginning of operations, will be coordinated with the Fire Department\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Process Hazard Analyses, operating procedures, facility-specific training, and all other elements of American Spraytech\u0092s comprehensive accidental release prevention program, will be evaluated, updated, and re-submitted prior to beginning of operations in 2025 Q2."
