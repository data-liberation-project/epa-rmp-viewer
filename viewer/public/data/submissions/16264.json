      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Butane Storage\nBuckeye Refining Company, LLC\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe primary function of Buckeye Refining Company is to process pipeline interface back into gasoline and fuel oil.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  We are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Safety at our facility depends upon the manner in which we handle butane as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of our equipment.  Furthermore, comprehensive training received by our employees upon hiring adds to the inherent safety of our distribution facility.\n\nOur emergency response program was developed in 1985 by an outside consulting firm and updated in 1998 internally.  In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release does occur, we are coordinated with Indianola Volunteer Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to store butane for blending with gasoline for rvp and octane enhancement.  Butane arrives at our facility via transport and is stored in one (1) storage tank.  This facility has equipment for unloading transports.  Transports being off-loaded are done so with the assistance of a company employee.  Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is butane.  The maximum amount of butane that can be stored at this p"

The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\nWe have calculated worst case release scenarios based on the NPGA-EPA approved TNO-Multi energy method.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for butane involves a catastrophic release from butane storage resulting in a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion, or BLEVE.  The scenario involves the release of 126772 lb. of butane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor that finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather, the maximum distance of 0.40 miles was obtained corresponding to a flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nAn alternative release scenario involves a release from butane from piping at the transport stanchion, due to a pullaway, resulting in a Vapor Cloud Fire.  In this scenario 81 lb. of butane is released in 10 minutes.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include positive shutoff valves, excess flow valves, back flow check valves, and an emergency shutoff valve with mechanical, thermal, and remote capability.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability limit is approximately 0.02 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1979 Editio"

The reviews focus on operating procedures, equipment functions and handling practices to identify possible hazards including employee participation, contractor safety, hot work permitting, and management of change.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with extensive knowledge of facility operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Buckeye Refining Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nBuckeye Refining Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision for three months or until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis by experienced company personnel.  \n\nMaintenance\nBuckeye Refining Company carries"

Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified personnel from an outside firm with previous training in these practices.  Furthermore, personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\nBuckeye Refining Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  \n\nIncident Investigation\nBuckeye Refining Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of propane. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History                                                                                                                            Buckeye Refining Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.  \n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\nBuckeye Refining Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of butane.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nOur facility's emergency response plan is based upon the oil pollution prevention act of 1990.
