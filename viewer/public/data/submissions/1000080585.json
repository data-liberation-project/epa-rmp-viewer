Employees have access to all information generated from the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters including specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for each unit's process parameters, including Safe Upper and Lower Limit and Consequence of Deviation tables.   Operating parameters are also documented in operating procedures, in the electronic control systems, and in equipment Safety Information Sheets (SIS).  The process parameters include temperature, level, composition and pressure.

These reviews include not only the original study data, but they include process changes in the last five years that have been made through the MOC process and they include a review of incidents both in the unit and in other similar units throughout industry.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  Operating procedures cover critical and infrequently performed tasks and provides a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The management of change (MOC) process includes steps to update and modify procedures to reflect changes made in the plants.    \r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chevron Salt Lake Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the plant operation, plant specific operating procedures, and they again review all changes made and any incidents that have occurred in the specific units.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including testing and coaching to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, ensuring the competency of the contractors and their employees is critical to the safe operations of the facility.  The refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  \r\n\r\nSalt Lake Refinery has a comprehensive Contractor Health, Safety & Environment Management (CHESM) process to assess and pre-qualify contractors before they can work in the refinery.

To ensure a continued safe work environment, the Chevron Salt Lake Refinery systematically evaluates contractor safety programs and performance.  \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that all variables such as procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for a safe startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team, consisting of both employees and contractors, uses checklists to verify various aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe and reliable operating condition.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable operating limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified or if equipment is found to be approaching end of life, the risk is assessed and plans are put in place to mitigate the risk and/or correct the deficiency and remove the equipment from service before the equipment becomes a hazard.  \r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Chevron Salt Lake Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  These processes include the refinery's Positive Material Identification (PMI) process, vendor selection process and design standards.  These processes help ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry, presence and exit of support personnel from the process unit, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e"

These and other procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to mitigate any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Through the MOC process, any affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all affected operating and maintenance personnel are provided training on the change in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire or explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental release, or personal injury.  Incident investigations follow written guidelines to determine the root causes and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings and develops recommended solutions or corrective actions to prevent a recurrence. All solutions are entered into a database for tracking completion and for management verification and validation.

These compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years or more frequently as changes in operations occur.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  Quarterly updates are required by Chevron Management.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nChevron Salt Lake Refinery uses administrative controls and work processes to identify hazards that must be managed and mitigated to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP-covered process at the Chevron Salt Lake Refinery. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Chevron Salt Lake Refinery has installed engineering controls as  safety features to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release (mitigate).
