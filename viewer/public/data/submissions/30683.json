Three water cannons and sprinkler system are present to supress fire and vapor release.  \n\nThe temperature of the EO railcar is monitored twice a day.  A catch plate is postioned under the EO railcar contain small leaks.  \n\nThe centifugal pumps have double mechanical seals with a low barrier fluid shutoff, a high and low amperage shutoff, and a high temperture shutoff. \n\nBulk EO storage tank (T-22) and Bulk storage tank (T-19) have high and low level alarms, high and low pressure alarms, and a high temperature alarm.  T-22 is positioned in a concrete bunker and is also equipped with its own water deluge system.  T-19 is positoned within a concrete diked area.  \n\nIntermediate storage vessels are equipped with high and low pressure alarms and high temperature alarms.  These vessels are also protected with a water sprinkler system.  \n\nPumps to the reactors are equipped with bypasses that operate automatically should the pumps experience high pressure.  \n\nReactors are positioned on load cells and are equipped with high temperature and high pressure alarms.  \n\nPiping used for EO and PO is schedule 80 pipe capable of withstanding corrosion.  The piping is painted and in open areas insultated as well to protect the piping from the heat of the sun.",

Whatever its form, it may present a potentially serious threat to company operations, health and safety of employees and the surrounding community.  Some emergencies are governed by strict federal, state and local regulations.  Therefore it is essential that all employees working at this site be aware of potential emergency situations, to plan for them, and to follow emergency procedures should an emergency occur.\n\nThe purpose of these procedures are to provide information and establish guidelines for responding to emergencies.  Our procedures include requirements for emergency notification to outside agencies, emergency communications within the plant, evacuation plans, and steps for implementing response activities.  \n\nThe procedures are divided into separate sections for quick reference and easy access to vital information.  These sections include plan implementation, emergency equipment and personnel responsibilities, facility layout, emergency procedures, emergency contacts and communication, and spill management.  All employees are expected to become familiar with emergency procedures and are trained on the procedures on an annual basis.\n\nThe Janesville plant is seriously committed to operating safely.  The plant has a comprehensive set of emergency response procedures.  We have a fully trained emergency response team on hand capable of responding to chemical releases.  We also participate as an active member of the county LEPC.  Site officials work closely with the local fire department and safety and environmental consultants to help insure the facility complies with all permits and environmental regulations.\n\nFacility operations:\n\nThe facility is known as a manufacturer of surfactants.  The principal products include food ingredients, Kosher specialty oils, fabric softeners, and specialty surfactants.  These ingredients are used in food, cosmeti"

As a result we have written operating procedures that are used to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  The equipment used to process with these regulated substances is equipped with alarms for pressure, temperature, and hazardous vapors to alert personnel of emergency conditions.  These alarms allow personnel to safely and quickly respond to conditions like a chemical release before a release has off-site consequences.  The facilty has an active security program and works closely with the local authorities in preplanning and prevention of chemical releases.  \n\nFive year accident history:\n\nThere have been no releases from this site in the past 5 years that have resulted in off-site consequences.\n\nEmergency response program:\n\nOur facility has a highly trained emergency response team that equipped to quickly control and mitigate small releases of regulated substances at the facility before releases become too big.  Team members practice responding to potential  response scenarios of regulated substances as part of their annual training requirement.  This training is led by the on-site Health, Safety and Environmental Manager.  Emergency drills are conducted and detailed training on the facility contingency plan is provided to all employees.  The Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Manager serves as a member of the Rock County LEPC.
