The ammonium nitrate produced is mixed with the liquid urea produced to result in a final urea-ammonium nitrate solution product.  These products are primarily used as agricultural fertilizers.\n\nAlthough initial construction and operation of the Lawrence facility was in 1954, numerous changes, additions, and improvements have resulted in the facilities and final products as noted above.  The existing ammonia unit was completed in 1972 and replaced the original 1954 ammonia facility.\n\nThe facility produces, handles, and stores large quantities of anhydrous ammonia in its operations.  The ammonia units use natural gas, air, and water for the production of ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with by product carbon dioxide to produce liquid urea. Nitric acid is produced using ammonia and air and is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate. The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product.  A limited amount of ammonia is combined with water to produce a 25% aqua ammonia product.\n\nEach of these production units along with product ammonia storage and handling constitute the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management Program rule.  Regulated substances include anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  In addition, flammable substances as a class, and methane (natural gas) and hydrogen produced as an intermediate in ammonia production specifically, are regulated under Risk Management.

All of these accidents have resulted in injuries to plant employees requiring medical treatment. In general, the injuries were burns from either flammables, aqua ammonia, or anhydrous ammonia.  In only one instance, was the accidental release of a quantity sufficient to require reporting of the release under other regulations.  On another occasion there was an incident that resulted in an off-site consequence when a nearby business voluntarily evacuated its building.  Investigation of the building found the ammonia concentration to be less than 10 ppm. \n\nDetails of these accidents are provided elsewhere in this Risk Management submittal.\n\nSynopsis of Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management Plan rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility, the regulated substances include anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and chlorine as regulated toxics, and flammables as a class which include methane and hydrogen.  Worse case analysis were done for all three toxics.  The ammonia case was found to have the greatest distance to the endpoint.  Th"

Alternate scenarios, which are more reasonably likely events, for each regulated toxic and flammables in general must also be presented.\n\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release-Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor, and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals. It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air. Some of this ammonia is chilled to a liquid for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer which conditions the soil to produce higher yields and better quality crops. A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with other compounds to produce urea, ammonium nitrate, and urea/ammonium solution fertilizers. More than 80 percent of manufactured ammonia is used as fertilizer.\n\nBecause of the seasonal nature of fertilizer use and application in agriculture, large quantities of the ammonia produced at this facility must be stored until needed by the ultimate consumer.  The RMP rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst case event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nFor this facility, the largest single quantity of anhydrous ammonia is held in the two diked atmospheric storage tanks.  Each tank holds 7500 tons.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire amount is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of  one tank.  This unlikely event was modeled by a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release events.  Details of the results of this modeling are provide"

This distance does take into account the passive mitigation of the earthen dike that exist around the ammonia storage tank thus reducing the release rate to 52.25 kg/s.  These storage tanks are inspected on a regular frequency as part of our mechanical integrity program.\n\nTo assure that the event indicated above was, in fact, the worst case as the rule defines it; failure of ammonia storage present at the site where ammonia is stored at higher pressure, but much lower quantities was also modeled.  In addition, a worst case failure of a chlorine cylinder was similarly modeled.  Also, the failure of one of the aqua ammonia storage tanks was analyzed under worse case conditions.  Neither of these resulted in a distance greater than the circumstance noted above. \n\nIt should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst case is so low as to be non-existent.  Many identical and similar tanks are in existence all over the world and have been in service for many years.  We are not aware of any such failure of these tanks or even failures of a lesser nature that would allow accidental releases of smaller quantities of ammonia.  Analysis of this scenario is required by the rule, and, as such, was completed.  Facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including these, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nWorst Case Flammable\n\nAs the rule requires, the largest quantity flammable release and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion must be analyzed as the worst case for these substances.  In this facility, a failure releasing the entire contents of the ammonia conversion loop constitutes the largest flammable release.  This quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document (Equation C-1).  Details "

Impact distance is relatively limited as a result, but it does have off-site impact.\n\nAlternate Case Toxics \n\n    Ammonia\n\nMore reasonably likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Significantly lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards are present as they are through out the plant, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.  Such events can include failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario, modeled using DEGADIS, for this facility is the\nfailure of a 4 inch loading hose that requires 10 minutes to secure and stop the flow. Details of the results of this modeling are provided in the Risk Management Plan Submittal. The 10 minute time frame is longer than what we feel would actually be required, but we used 10 minutes in an attempt to be conservative.  Modeled impact distance is substantially lower for this more reasonable, but not necessarily likely, release events.  This scenario will have an off-site impact. \n\n    Aqua Ammonia\n\nAqua Ammonia is another nitrogen-based fertilizer made by combining ammonia with water. Our product contains 25 percent ammonia and is either directly applied or used to manufacture phosphate fertilizers.  Aqua Ammonia is also known as ammonia water, ammonium hydroxide and household ammonia. It is a colorless liquid with a strong characteristic odor.\n\nThe alternate release scenario, modeled using DEGADIS, for this facility is the failure of a 4 inch loading hose"

This scenario will have an off-site impact.\n  \n    Chlorine\n\nChlorine is used at several locations in this plant as a biocidal agent for cooling water systems, much as it is also used in swimming pools.  It is used as a gas from one ton chlorine cylinders through an injection system to the circulating cooling water.\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumed is failure of the 0.5 inch connecting tubing from the cylinder resulting in the release of gaseous chlorine.  This release was modeled using the DEGADIS dispersion program. Details of the results of this modeling are provided in the Risk Management Plan Submittal.  This scenario will have an off-site impact.\n    \n    Flammables\n\nLarge volumes of flammable gases are handled throughout the plant, even though actual physical inventory is relatively low especially considering the quantity of inert gases and steam mixed with the flammable gases.  More likely flammable release events include failures of smaller pipes and lines in comparison to the large release contemplated in the worst case analysis.\n\nThe alternate release scenario chosen was to have an event that resulted in the relief valve on the discharge of the 103-J synthesis relieving gas for four minutes and this quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document (Equation C-1). Details of the results of this modeling are provided in the Risk Management Plan Submittal. This type of event is not likely to occur, but since the worse case scenario reached a receptor the regulations require that the alternate case reaches a public receptor thus this is a very conservative scenario.  Most more reasonable and likely events result in minimal impact distances.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitate"
