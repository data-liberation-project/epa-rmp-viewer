This publication has specific guidance requirements and calculation procedures for Wastewater Treatment Plants regulated under section 112 of the Clean Air Act.\n\nIt has been determined that the City of Lancaster Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility has to comply with Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\n\"The phrase \"risk management program\" refers to all of the requirements of part 68, which must be implemented on an on-going basis.  The phrase \"risk management plan \" refers to the document summarizing the risk management program that you must submit to EPA.\"\n \nDue to the fact that the WWTP is covered under this regulation, the following activities must be undertaken:\n    \n\"Covered facilities must develop and implement a RMP and maintain documentation of the program at the site.  The RMP will include and analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\" \n\n\"Covered facilities also must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan, which includes registration information, to EPA no later than June 21, 1999, or the date on which the facility first has more than a threshold quantity in a process, whichever is later.  The Risk Management Plan provides a summary of the Risk Management Program.  The RMP will be available to federal, state, and local government agencies and the public.\"\n\n\"Covered facilities also must continue to implement the RMP and update their RMPs periodically or when processes change, as required by the rule.\"\n\n\nThe WWTP is covered because it is a stationary source that stores chlorine above the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds in a single process.\n\n    Process:    Any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance c"

The maximum quantity stored on site is ten (10) full cylinders.  Of these ten (10) cylinders, six (6) full cylinders are stored inside and four (4) are stored outside.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored outside is four (4) full cylinders.  Once cylinders become empty, they are moved from inside the chlorination building to the outside storage area.\n\n\"In general, if you have two or more vessels containing a regulated substance that are connected through piping or hoses for the transfer of the regulated substance, you must consider the total quantity of a regulated substance in all the connected vessels and piping when determining if you have a threshold quantity in a process.\" (1-6)\n\nIf only one cylinder was used at a time, the City's WWTP would not be required to develop a Risk Management Program because they would be under the 2,500 pound threshold quantity.  Due to the amount of wastewater chlorinated at the Lancaster WWTP, it is necessary to manifold two chlorine cylinders together. \n\n\n    Flow Diagram:  Two cylinders---> vacuum regulator --->  chlorinator ---> chlorine ejector\n\nAs the diagram above shows, two cylinders are connected together resulting in a threshold quantity over the 2,500 pound limit.  Interconnecting the two vessels together creates a single process.  Thus, the WWTP must develop a Risk Management Program.\n\n\"The third possibility you must consider is whether you have separate vessels that contain the same regulated substance that are located such that they could be involved in a single release.  If so, You must add together the total quantity in all such vessels to determine if you have more than a threshold quantity.\" (1-7)\n\nThe possibility of an acci"

The outside storage area is a brick and steel structure capable of withstanding fire, earthquake, and collision hazards.  Pillions made of steel and cement protect the area from collisions and the escape of cylinders.  A release from one chlorine cylinder would not lead to a release from another cylinder located next to it.\nIt has been determined that the two cylinders connected together are considered to be a single process.  The associated piping is also considered to be a part of that process.\n\n    \nWhen does the process end?   \n\n    \"The process ends when the concentration of chlorine in the wastestream is no longer above one percent, unless other regulated substances are present above their threshold quantities or the vessel is otherwise considered part of the process because it could cause a release of the covered vessels holding regulated substances or hinder a response to such a release.\"\n\n    Process ends when the Cl2 mixes with the process water.\n    * 150 gal/min of process water\n    * 1000 LB/day maximum Cl2 input\n\n1.8 million LB/day of process water to 1000 LB/ day Cl2 creates a .05 % chlorine solution.  \n\n\n\"If your process consists of two or more interconnected vessels, you must determine the maximum quantity for each vessel and the connecting pipes or hoses.  The maximum for each individual vessel and pipe is added together to determine the maximum for the process.\"\n\nStandard operating procedure at the Lancaster WWTP directs personnel to only change chlorine when all chlorine is removed from the network by vacuum.  After all chlorine is drained for the system, two new cylinders are connected to the manifold.  At no time is there more than 4,000 pounds of chlorine within the process.\n\nSince it has been determined that the Lancaster WWTP has to develop a RMP and it falls under the classification of a Program 2, the following is required:\n\n\n(1) Hazard Assessment\n    (a) Worst-case analysis\n"

Other scenarios were examined but determined to be less likely of ever occurring.  The outside diameter of the chlorine cylinder valve is one inch.  The actual opening inside the valve for chlorine to escape is only 3/8 inch.  \n\nThe alternative scenario will be modeled as if it where to occur outside.  This scenario is used to represent an event in which the building doors are open, the building in not leak-tight, or the ventilation system is on.

OSHA defines emergency response as \"a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders... to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.\"  The key factor here is that responders are designated for such tasks by their employer.  This definition excludes \"responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release are, or by maintenance personnel\"  as well as \" responses to releases of hazardous substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard (i.e., fire, explosion, or chemical exposure).\"  Thus, if you expect your employees to take action to end a small leak (e.g., shutting a valve) or clean up a spill that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard, this action could be considered an incidental response and you would not need to develop an emergency response program if your employees are limited to such activities.\" (8-2)\n\nDue to the"

Due to the amount of wastewater chlorinated at the Lancaster WWTP, it is necessary to manifold two chlorine cylinders together. \n\n\n    Flow Diagram:  Two cylinders---> vacuum regulator --->  chlorinator ---> chlorine ejector\n\nAs the diagram above shows, two cylinders are connected together resulting in a threshold quantity over the 2,500 pound limit.  Interconnecting the two vessels together creates a single process.  Thus, the WWTP must develop a Risk Management Program.\n\n\"The third possibility you must consider is whether you have separate vessels that contain the same regulated substance that are located such that they could be involved in a single release.  If so, You must add together the total quantity in all such vessels to determine if you have more than a threshold quantity.\" (1-7)\n\nThe possibility of an accident effecting two or more full chlorine cylinders stored outside is nonexistent.

Where such instructions are not available, you will need to develop them.\" (6-22)\n\nContained in this RMP are manufacturers' recommended maintenance procedures for equipment used in the chlorination process.  Inspection and testing information was also obtained from the Operation of Wastewater Treatment Plants; Volume 2.  \n\nAt the Lancaster WWTP, procedures used to maintain the mechanical integrity of the chlorination process are followed.  Maintenance procedures are based on manufacturers' recommendations, prior operating experience, and industry standards.\n\n\"In the RMP, you are required to report on the date of the most recent review or revision of your maintenance procedures and the date of the most recent equipment inspection or test and equipment inspected or tested.  You must keep on site your written procedures and schedules as well as any agreements you have with contractors.\"  (6-24)\n\nAt the Lancaster WWTP, the Maintenance Supervisor has a computer system that automatically generates work orders.

A maintenance log will be developed to document work performed on the chlorination system.  \n\nThe last overview of the maintenance program was completed in April 1999.\n\nAlong with the manufacturers' maintenance procedures, documents published by The Chlorine Institute will be purchased to supplement the maintenance information.  \n\n\"You must establish a schedule for inspecting and testing equipment associated with covered processes.  The frequency of inspections and tests must be consistent with manufacture's recommendations, industry standards or codes, good engineering practices, and your prior operating experience.\" (6-24)\n\n\n(6)Incident Investigation \n\n\"You must investigate each incident which resulted in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  A catastrophic release is one that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.  Exhibit 6-10 briefly summarizes the steps you must take for investigation incidents.  You should also consider investigating minor accidents or near misses because they may help you identify problems that could lead to more serious accident; however, you are not required to do so under part 68.\"    (6-29)\n\nThe Lancaster WWTP will investigate all incidences that result in the release of chlorine within 48 hours.  All findings will be summarized in a report that will include the following information:\n* Factors contributing to the incident\n* Recommendation for corrective actions\n\nModifications, if applicable, will be made to the chlorination system and RMP to prevent further incidents.  All incident investigation reports will be kept on file for five years.\n\nThe Lancaster WWTP will use an Incident Investigation Report to document each incident that occurs.\n\n\n(7)Compliance Audits\n\n\"Any risk management program should be reviewed periodically to ensure that employees and contractors are i"

An audit reviews each of the prevention program elements to ensure that they are up-to-date and are being implemented and will help you identify problem areas and take corrective actions.\" (6-26)\n\nDuring the months of  January 1999 to May 1999, the RMP for the Lancaster WWTP was developed.  All information pertaining to the RMP was collected, organized, and revised.\n\nAll aspects of the fully developed RMP will be reevaluated within two years by supervisory staff knowledgeable in the chlorination process. \n\n\"You must keep a written record of audit findings and your response to those findings and documents that deficiencies have been corrected.  You must keep the two most recent audit reports, but you need not keep a report that is more than five years old.  You may also want to keep a record of who conducted the audit, but you are not required to do this.\" (6-27)\n\nExhibit 6-9 was reviewed and found to be an appropriate checklist for completing an audit of the safety information and hazard review contained in the RMP.  Based on the responses, operational changes and equipment purchases will be made.  All changes will be documented.  \n\nThe Lancaster WWTP will keep the two most recent audit reports within the prior five-year period.\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\"If you have at least one Program 2 or Program 3 at you facility, then part 68 may require you to implement an emergency response program, consisting of an emergency response plan, emergency response equipment procedures, employee training, and procedures to ensure the program is up-to-date.  This requirement applies if your employees will respond to some releases involving regulated substances.\" (8-1)\n\nWhat is a response?\n\n\"EPA interprets \"response\" to be consistent with the definition of response specified under OSHA's HAZWOPER Standard.  OSHA defines emergency response as"

      "SummaryText": " \"a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders... to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.\"  The key factor here is that responders are designated for such tasks by their employer.  This definition excludes \"responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release are, or by maintenance personnel\"  as well as \" responses to releases of hazardous substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard (i.e., fire, explosion, or chemical exposure).\"  Thus, if you expect your employees to take action to end a small leak (e.g., shutting a valve) or clean up a spill that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard, this action could be considered an incidental response and you would not need to develop an emergency response program if your employees are limited to such activities.\" (8-2)\n\nDue to the fact that employees at the Lancaster WWTP will only respond to small leaks that can be contained by shutting a valve, the WWTP is not required to develop a full blown Emergency Response Program in the RMP.\n\nUnder the RMP requirements, the WWTP is required to coordinate with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the facility.\n\nCoordination with local responders entails the following steps:\n\n* Ensure that you have set up a way to notify emergency responders when there is a need.\n* If you have a covered process with a regulated toxic, work with the local emergency planning entity to ensure that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA regarding a response.\n\nThe Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of Lancaster County is currently has an Off-Site Response Plan in place for the chlorination operation at the "
