One Chloralert leak detector is located in the chlorine cylinder room and the other is located in the chlorinator room.  If these sensors detect a leak, a highly visible light located outside the building is triggered to alert personal of a leak.  These leak detectors are also connected to the WWTP's computer system.  When the sensors are triggered, an alarm message will display on the operations computers and digital display located in the control room. \n\nTwo self contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA) are located outside the chorine cylinder room.

The maximum amount of chlorine stored outside is four (4) full cylinders.  Once cylinders become empty, they are moved from inside the chlorination building to the outside storage area.\n\nIn general, if you have two or more vessels containing a regulated substance that are connected through piping or hoses for the transfer of the regulated substance, you must consider the total quantity of a regulated substance in all the connected vessels and piping when determining if you have a threshold quantity in a process. (1-6)\n\nIf only one cylinder was used at a time, the City's WWTP would not be required to develop a Risk Management Program because they would be under the 2,500 pound threshold quantity.  Due to the amount of wastewater chlorinated at the Lancaster WWTP, it is necessary to manifold two chlorine cylinders together. \n\n\n\tFlow Diagram:  Two cylinders---> vacuum regulator --->  chlorinator ---> chlorine ejector\n\nAs the diagram above shows, two cylinders are connected together resulting in a threshold quantity over the 2,500 pound limit.  Interconnecting the two vessels together creates a single process.  Thus, the WWTP must develop a Risk Management Program.\n\nThe third possibility you must consider is whether you have separate vessels that contain the same regulated substance that are located such that they could be involved in a single release.  If so, You must add together the total quantity in all such vessels to determine if you have more than a threshold quantity. (1-7)\n\nThe possibility of an acci"

The associated piping is also considered to be a part of that process.\n\n\t\nWhen does the process end?   \n\n\tThe process ends when the concentration of chlorine in the wastestream is no longer above one percent, unless other regulated substances are present above their threshold quantities or the vessel is otherwise considered part of the process because it could cause a release of the covered vessels holding regulated substances or hinder a response to such a release.\n\n\tProcess ends when the Cl2 mixes with the process water.\n\t* 150 gal/min of process water\n\t* 1000 LB/day maximum Cl2 input\n\n1.8 million LB/day of process water to 1000 LB/ day Cl2 creates a .05 % chlorine solution.  \n\n\nIf your process consists of two or more interconnected vessels, you must determine the maximum quantity for each vessel and the connecting pipes or hoses.

Due to the amount of wastewater chlorinated at the Lancaster WWTP, it is necessary to manifold two chlorine cylinders together. \n\n\n\tFlow Diagram:  Two cylinders---> vacuum regulator --->  chlorinator ---> chlorine ejector\n\nAs the diagram above shows, two cylinders are connected together resulting in a threshold quantity over the 2,500 pound limit.  Interconnecting the two vessels together creates a single process.  Thus, the WWTP must develop a Risk Management Program.\n\nThe third possibility you must consider is whether you have separate vessels that contain the same regulated substance that are located such that they could be involved in a single release.  If so, You must add together the total quantity in all such vessels to determine if you have more than a threshold quantity.

The outside storage area is a brick and steel structure capable of withstanding fire, earthquake, and collision hazards.

Written standard operating procedures were developed for the safe handling of chlorine for the given circumstances mentioned above.\n\nAdditional safety and operating procedures were taken from the Operation of Wastewater Treatment Plants; Volume 2.  This training manual contains pertinent information pertaining to the operations at the Lancaster WWTP, and pages of this manual are included with the RMP.\n\nSafety and training videos published by The Chorine Institute are used to help educate the WWTP operators.\n\nStandard operating procedures were reviewed and revised on April 16, 1999.\n\n\n\t\n\tStandard Operating Procedures for the Safe Handling of Chlorine\n\t\t\t\tApril-1999\n\nChlorine is an extremely toxic chemical and must be handled with extreme care and caution.\n\n1) Storage\n\n\ta) Temperature in the chlorine cylinder storage room should be approximately 600F or slightly warmer.\n\n\tb) Temperature in the chlorinator room should be maintained at a normal indoor temperature of about 680F.\n\n\tc) A maximum of six cylinders can be stored inside the chlorination building and eight cylinders can be stored in the outside storage area.\n\n\td) The maximum administrative limit for full chlorine cylinders is 10 full cylinders.\n\n\t\ti) Of the 10 cylinders, 6 full cylinders are stored inside the chlorination building and four full cylinders will be stored outside.  As cylinders are used, the empties are moved from the inside to the outside, and the full cylinders are moved from the outside to the inside.  \n\n\te) Eight chlorine cylinders are ordered when the final two full cylinders are connected and in use.  \n\n\tf) Full cylinders must be brought into the chlorination building approximately 24 hours or more before using so that the temperature of the contents can become equalized with the room temperature.\n\n\tg) All storage area"

The ventilation fan to the building must be on, and the doors to the cylinder building must be securely fastened in the open position.\n\n\te) When an empty container is removed from service the valve must be closed, valve end cap replaced, and the valve protective hood reinstalled to prevent moisture form entering the container.\n\n3) Cylinder Use\n\n\ta) Before chlorine handling is commenced, the employees performing the activities must verify that the safety equipment is present and in good working order.\n\n\tb) Ton cylinders must be chocked in a horizontal position and the valves must be in a vertical line.  Gas is withdrawn from the upper valve.\n\n\tc) Never use containers that are warmer than the room in which the chlorinator is located.  If the cylinder is warmer than the room, gas can condense into a liquid in the gas supply piping and this liquid could possibly enter the chlorinator.  Liquid chlorine will damage equipment, cause faulty operation, and possible cause failure of the process.\n\n\td) The ventilation fans to the cylinder room and the chlorinator room should be on during any periods in which either room is occupied.\n\n\te) Due to the amount of chlorine consumed, it is necessary to manifold two chlorine cylinders together and discharge them simultaneously.\n\n\ti) The temperature of all containers connected to the header must be equal and remain equal during use.  If containers are of unequal temperatures, gas will flow from the warmer con"
