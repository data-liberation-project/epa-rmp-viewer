The facility started up in 2008 and was purchased from Hawkeye Shell Rock, LLC by FHR in 2010. \n\n  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nFHR is committed to worker and public safety.  FHR management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety is the number one consideration in the handling of regulated substances; our goal is to prevent accidental releases through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel.  The Facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices based on company and industry experience developed over the years.  FHR's practice is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained plant personnel will respond to help control and contain the release within their training and qualifications.  The local Fire Department will be contacted for additional response.  \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The Facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the presence in excess of threshold quantities of Denaturant (natural gasoline), which is considered a flammable mixture and used to make the ethanol an undrinkable mixture.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nFHR is subject to and has programs in place to address accidental release prevention meas"

General prevention program align with RMP elements and are:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFHR encourages employees to participate in safety management and accident prevention.  The Facility has developed an employee participation program as part of the RMP program.  Process Safety Information (PSI), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\n\nAn initial PHA was completed in September 2008.  The PHA is revalidated at least every five years.  The controlled copy of the PHA is maintained at the Facility and details the study methodology used, items reviewed (hazards of the process, facility siting, etc.), study team composition requirements, and the system used to address study findings and recommendations.  The last PHA revalidation was completed in December 2015.\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains documents describing PSI, including safety data sheets.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\nFacility Management is responsible for developing and implementing written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the PSI.  The operating procedures that have been developed have been prepared as a guide for those involved with initial start-up, normal operation, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown of the process.  The Facility has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in facility operations.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nPrior to awarding contracts, an FHR representative evaluates the prior safety performance of any prospective contrac"

At that time, FHR reviews known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards that are related to the contractor's work and the covered process.  The contract employer representative is also informed of the applicable provisions of the emergency action plan, conditions regarding entrance to the process and the applicable safe work practices that must be followed in order to work at the site.  Because contractors may work on or near the process equipment, the Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, and are aware of the hazards in their workplace.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nAs part of the MOC process, whenever a modification to the existing chemical process is planned, either temporary or permanent, a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is required.  The PSSR confirms that, prior to putting into service, the construction and equipment being used is in accordance with design specifications or the technical basis for any deviation to a design specification.  The PSSR also confirms that the safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate training for each involved employee has been completed.  A PSSR includes field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention measures are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nA mechanical integrity program has been developed as part of PSM that defines requirements for ensuring the integrity of process equipment.  Written procedures help ensure the safe implementation of maintenance activities thus promoting the reliability and integrity of process equipment.  This program also includes training, regular inspections and equipment testing.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practi"

These safety standards control entry into work areas and confined spaces, specify procedures to follow for isolating energy sources by lockout/tag-out and describe the permitting process for completing work in the Facility.  Safety standards and work procedures are reviewed annually.  \n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe Facility has a hot work permit program that details areas which require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.  A permit is required in process areas for cutting, welding, spark-producing equipment, etc., except in designated areas.  The procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot work until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with the hot work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Facility has a Management of Change (MOC) program that reviews proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change.  Changes are reviewed by an interdisciplinary team to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nFHR has procedures to promptly investigate incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a release of a regulated substance, fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental damage, or personal injury.  The procedures establish the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of events that could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases.

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Facility regularly conducts audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standards are adequate and are being followed.  A compliance audit of each program is conducted every three years.  The audits include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Facility management for resolution.  Findings and corrective actions taken in response to each finding are tracked until completion.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Facility include hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The RMP Program elements summarized previously apply to the Denaturant processes.  Program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.  In addition to RMP, the Facility has instrumentation and equipment to detect, contain, and reduce the consequences of a release, including:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n-    Monitoring equipment to detect density, temperature, level, and pressure changes\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n-    Atmospheric relief devices\n\n-    Valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n-    Automated shutdown systems\n\n-    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e., uninterruptible power supply for the process control system)\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n-    Containment to contain liquid releases\n\n-    Fire Hydrants and Fire Monitors\n\n-    Trained emergency response personnel\n\n-    Emergency response equipment located on-site\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the preceding five years, there were no accidental releases with on-site or off-site consequences meeting EPA criteria for inclusion in th"
