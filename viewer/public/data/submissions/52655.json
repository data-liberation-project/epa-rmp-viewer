The plant primarily manufactures anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions.  As a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex, this facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require that facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of those substances.  The plan requirements include hazard assessments defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facility?s accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for the Coffeyville Nitrogen Plant.\n\nFacility Overview\n\nThe Coffeyville Nitrogen Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex producing anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions.  The complex produces for market approximately 670,000 tons of UAN and 145,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia annually for use as agricultural fertilizers.  The design of the facility, which started production in January 2001, incorporates state-of-art safety and environmental controls for the protection of the employees and the surrounding community.  \n\nThe facility consists of an air separation unit, a gasification unit, an ammonia synthesis unit, and an UAN unit.  The air separation unit, while located on the Coffeyville Nitrogen site, is independently owned and operated by BOC Gases.  The air separation unit makes high purity oxygen and nitrogen for use "

      "SummaryText": "in the gasification unit.  In addition, BOC markets these gases along with argon to off-site customers. \n\nThe gasification unit produces hydrogen gas using the GE Energy Hydrogen Generation Process.  The gasifier produces raw hydrogen and carbon oxides by the partial oxidation of petroleum coke with oxygen in the presence of water.  The petroleum coke is provided primarily by the neighboring Coffeyville Resources refinery and supplemented with coke from other locations.  The hydrogen is purified by shift conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, the removal of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, and pressure swing absorption of trace contaminants.  \n\nIn the ammonia synthesis unit the hydrogen from the gasification unit reacts with nitrogen from the air separation unit to make anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is either sold for direct fertilizer applications or upgraded for UAN solutions.  Ammonia along with by-product carbon dioxide from the gasification unit is used to produce liquid urea in the UAN plant.  Ammonia and air in the same plant are used to produce weak nitric acid solution that is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate.  The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product. Ammonia and UAN solutions can be shipped to the farmers by both truck and railcar.  On-site storage tanks have been constructed to safely hold the ammonia and UAN products until the farmers are ready to apply the fertilizers.\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nCoffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations.  We are pursuing elimination or reduction of our use of toxic substances and minimizing our use of energy and the generation of all wastes to the extent technically and economically feasible.

By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace, and improve the environment.\n\nThe above goals were applied to the design and construction of the Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers Plant.  The gasification process substitutes high grade feedstock, natural gas, with a low-grade feedstock, petroleum coke.  Petroleum coke is the end product from the condensation process in oil cracking.  Refineries have difficulties finding a market for their coke due to its poor fuel characteristics.  A conventional natural gas based ammonia plant would consume 28,000 cubic feet for every ton of ammonia produced.  Coffeyville Nitrogen chose to utilize the GE Energy Hydrogen Generation Process using coke as a feedstock.  Substituting coke for natural gas conserves over 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, which can be used for home heating, electrical power generation, or in the production of other materials.  Constructing the facility next to a refinery that produces a large volume of coke provides a reliable source of raw material, reduces the energy required to transport the coke, and allows for the potential return of energy or raw materials to the refinery.\n\nThe environmental design objective for this plant was to achieve significant emission reduction compared to the conventional nitrogen plant.  No hazardous solids are produced during normal operations.  The water effluent is sufficiently clean to enter the Coffeyville's municipal water treatment system.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe gasification unit, ammonia synthesis unit, and the UAN solution unit, along with the associated product ammonia storage and handling areas, constitute the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management Program rule.

In addition, flammable substances as a class, such as hydrogen produced by coke gasification, are regulated under Risk Management.  Finally, chlorine is also present in regulated threshold quantities on the site.  It is used as a biological control agent in the cooling water systems associated with the production units.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases.  It is this facility?s policy to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substance, in particular hazardous and regulated substances, as well as strive to eliminate to the extent possible even minor and inconsequential releases of any type.  Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of this plant, to the safety of its employees, and to the safety of the general public.\n\nTo achieve these goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\n\n* A knowledgeable, highly trained, and motivated employee group\n* A well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n* Improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention where appropriate\n* A superior safety and accident record as consequence of an excellent safety program\n* Preparation and training for emergency response and mitigation\n\nThe Coffeyville Nitrogen Plant has a written Emergency Response Plan and is committed to response and mitigation any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community, and environment.  The response plan is coordinated with the Coffeyville Resources Refinery, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and emergency response agencies.  Employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and in response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency."

Procedures and policies for work permits and maintenance and operating actions are in place for accident prevention.\n\n* Management of Change ? No changes are allowed in the process or procedures without review and authorization.  Safety impacts, technical basis, required procedure modification, and training are all considered in the review.  The procedure is used to verify the safety of the change and to prevent unintended consequences as a result of change.\n\n* Incident Investigation ? Any incident which results in a significant chemical release, or could have reasonably resulted in such a release, is promptly investigated by a facility team.  Findings of the investigation and recommendations for corrective action are documented as are the resolution of the recommendations and corrective actions.\n\n* Emergency Planning and Response ? The Process Safety Management/Prevention Program includes the facility Emergency Response Plan.\n\n* Compliance Audit ? Compliance with the program is audited at least every three years to verify compliance with these procedures.  Findings, if any, of the audit are documented and any deficiencies are corrected and documented.  The audit is conducted by persons knowledgeable of the facility processes, but not directly connected with the facility.\n\nThe facility is diligent in adhering to and maintaining its Process Safety/Prevention Program.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Coffeyville Nitrogen Plant has a written Emergency Response Program as required by the Risk Management Plan rule and other Environmental Protection Agency and OSHA rules.  This Plan is coordinated with Coffeyville Resources Refinery, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and is available to the responding agencies.  Emergency planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III has been provided to "

      "SummaryText": "the State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other appropriate agencies such as the local fire department.\n\nThe facility is an active participant in the Local Emergency Planning Committee and interacts with various local agencies in its emergency planning such as local fire departments; law enforcement agencies such as the police, highway patrol, and sheriff?s office; and hospitals.\n\nEmployees will receive annual training in the response plan and also receive various safety training, both in general, and in the competencies relative to their required roles in the plan.  Periodically the plan will be practiced in a tabletop classroom type setting and also tested in mock emergencies including participation by outside responding agencies.\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility investigated one accidental release during the past five years that met this definition and had a potential RMP off-site impact.  This release resulted in several contract employees from the adjacent refinery being treated for exposure to ammonia.  An incident investigation was conducted and actions taken on identified correctable opportunities.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements will be a continual and ongoing process at the facility that is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.   Some of the planned initiatives for continuing improvement of the safety/environmental/RMP programs include:\n?    Training in incident investigation methods for identified personnel;\n?    Additional audits of Management of Change (MOC) documentation by the PSM Coordinator;\n?    Potentially scheduling a formal process hazard anal"
