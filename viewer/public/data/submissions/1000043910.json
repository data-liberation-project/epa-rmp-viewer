Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\r\n\r\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Central Farm Service, Bricelyn, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and all other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia would be approximately 200,000 pounds in our two 12,000 and one 18,000 gallon storage tanks; and approximately 120,000 pounds available capacity in various nurse tanks ranging in capacity from 1,000 gallons to 1,450 gallons. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis facility is not constantly manned every work day.  There are approximately six employees who may work on the site periodically throughout the year, computing to one employee on site part-time.  At a minimum, the site would have a daily visual check. \r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload eq"
