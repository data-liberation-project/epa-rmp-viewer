The maximum quantity of chlorine onsite at any one time is estimated to be 36,000 pounds. \nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has multiple processes, which contain H2S and  SO2.  The maximum quantity of H2S and  SO2 on site does not exceed 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.  Therefore, these compounds do not meet RMP threshold levels.  However, we do have prevention and safety programs in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program.\n\nHazard Assessment Results \n\nWorst Case Scenario-Flammables:  The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest tank containing C4 Mixture. Tank 668 has a capacity of 30,000 bbls and is also the closest tank to an offsite receptor.  For the WCS, the full tank inventory of 6,000,000 pounds is assumed to release, completely vaporize and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 1.5 miles (as calculated by RMP*Comp). Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, we took not credit for passive mitigation measures in evaluating the WCS. It is important to note the WCS is based upon the simultaneous occurrence of several highly unlikely events, therefore the probability of the WCS actually occurring is extremely low.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario-Flammables:  The alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery is based upon the failure of a flexible hose used to load butane into tank trucks.  For this scenario, the quantity of butane released was based upon the maximum pump capacity of 305 gpm over a 60 minute interval or 92,000 lbs.  As with the WCS, we assumed all liquid would vaporize and ignite resulting in a VCE.  The distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.2 mile (as calculated by RMP*Comp).\n\nWorst Case Scenario-Toxics:  The WCS associated"

It is important to note the WCS is based upon highly unlikely events, therefore the probability of the WCS actually occurring is extremely low.\nAlternative Release Scenario-Flammables:  The ARS for toxic substances at the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery is based upon the mechanical failure of a thermal plug which is located in the dished-head of the chlorine bullet tank.  For this scenario, the release rate of chlorine is based upon the maximum flowrate through the thermal plug orfice.  For modeling purposes, this flowrate was maintained until the bullet tank was emptied. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for this ARS is 1.0 miles (as calculated by DEGADIS).\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has not had any RMP-defined accidents. While releases have been documented, none have been of threshold substances, nor have these releases had offsite consequences. After each release, we investigated what happened, recorded the recommendations, and made changes to our processes, procedures, or safety systems to mitigate and eliminate future problems. \nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery.
