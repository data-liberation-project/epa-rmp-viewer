      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nSuperValu, Inc. Is commited to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from any hazardous substances used in the refrigerated warehouse operation specifically the anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration process.  It is the policy of SuperValu, Inc. To comply with all Federal, State and Local laws.\n\nFacility description and regulated substance handled\n\nSuperValu, Inc. Owns and operates a refrigerated warehouse freezer facility at 101 Jefferson Avenue South and a warehouse perishable foods facility at 715 South 5th Street.  Both facilities are located in Hopkins, Minnesota.  The refrigeration systems at both facilities use anhydrous ammonia in a closed circuit charge configuration.  The total amount on anhydrous ammonia at the freezer facility is 27,000 pounds.  (RMP filed June 2004).  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia at the perishable foods facility is 48,214 pounds.  The Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the perishable foods facility since it is over the 10,000 pound threshold limited established by the EPA.  The refrigeration systems are operated and maintained by Palen Kimball Company who specializes in anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario defined by the EPA RMP Guidance is a failure of the refrigeration system resulting in the entire amount of 48,214 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia, which immediately vaporizes.  Under these conditions the look up tables in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration document (EPA-B-98-014) indicate that the distance to the toxic endpoint is 3.4 miles.  Based on the current (2000) census data the population density for the city of Hopkins, Minnesota is 2003.9 people per square mile.  This density rate provides the basis for a calculated population of 72,775 people within a 3.4 mile radius of the the site.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario\n\nThe alternate case scena"

      "SummaryText": "rio is defined by the EPA as a release that is significantly more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  For the SuperValu, Inc. Perishable foods facility this release is the failure of a one inch diameter liquid anhydrous ammonia pipeline which has a pressure of 55 pounds per square inch and the failure occurs over a ten minute period.  The look up tables in the same guidance document used for the worst case scenario indicate that the distance to the toxic endpoint for a 2,100 pounds per minute release is 0.81 miles.  The calculated population density within a 0.81 mile radius is 4,130 people.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP SuperValu, Inc. has complied with all the EPA requirements under 40 CFR 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on site.  Periodic functions such as hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP are conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive year accident history\n\nSuperValu, Inc. has not had an ammonia accident causing deaths, injuries, environmentaled or property damage, evacuations or in place sheltering in the last five years at the perishable foods facility.\n\nThe emergency response program\n\nSuperValu, Inc. Has developed an emergency action plan to deal with accidental ammonia releases.  In the event of an emergency it is the policy of SuperValu, Inc. To notify the local (City of Hopkins) Fire Department and to evacuate all employees from the facility.  Palen Kimball Company is prepared to respond to accidental releases to  the extent allowable under the established emergency response procedures."
