Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes, and operations facilities.  ConocoPhillips's policies and dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help to prevent accidental releases.  If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with the plant's Incident Response Plan.  \n \nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator, located at 68 El Paso Circle, Gallup, New Mexico, is owned and operated by ConocoPhillips Inc.  Wingate Fractinator is a natural gas liquids processing plant that receives raw product by pipeline.  The facility operates one fractionation train, which separates hydrocarbon liquids in the raw product streams.  Wingate Fractionator includes fractionation, product storage and loading equipment.  Products are transported from the facility via pipeline, truck, and railcar.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the Wingate Fractionator's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were on the plant site in quantities above the threshold quantities.  [Note: The term threshold quantity is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the plant in quantities ab"

[Note:  Natural gasoline is exempt from threshold determination based on its National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 3.]  There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These policies and procedures include and embrace the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements of the Risk Management Program that are currently in operation at the Wingate Fractionator.
