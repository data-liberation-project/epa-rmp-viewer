Tropicana has operated in Bradenton Florida for over 50 years and is a proven leader in the juice industry.\n\n\n\nTropicana's chilled juices require constant refrigeration to maintain their high quality and freshness.  Our cooling system utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  We use ammonia instead of other refrigerants because ammonia has several advantages over the available alternatives.  Ammonia is a very energy efficient refrigerant, does not cause damage to the ozone, and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.\n\n\n\nTropicana has proactively implemented many safety and emergency response programs to prevent the possibility of an accidental ammonia release.  These programs have been developed as part of our Prevention Plan and the Emergency Response Plan.  The Prevention Plan includes programs such as Process Safety Management (PSM), Planned Maintenance, Training, and written Operating Procedures.  The Emergency Response Plan includes the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), Hazardous Materials Response Team, Emergency Operations Center, and an Inclement Weather Plan.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Management was established by OSHA to prevent releases of hazardous chemicals.  Tropicana uses PSM to properly design, operate, and maintain the ammonia refrigeration system.  A comprehensive maintenance and training program has been established to ensure the integrity of all systems.  Tropicana established a Hazardous Materials Response team over 15 years ago.  This team is made up of approximately 65 employees all trained and prepared to react to any on-site emergency.  An Emergency Operations Center can be established at any time needed, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Our EOC and Hazmat teams are highly trained, experienced, and prepared for immediate action.  Tropicana maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan for the Bradent"

This system provides safe and standardized procedures for the control and mitigation of hazardous emergency situations.\n\n\n\nTropicana's corporate policy requires that all emergency response activities follow the procedures, organization, and guidance outlined within the ICP.  Tropicana's ICP includes coordination with local, state and federal emergency response agencies. Tropicana performs a Unified Command Drill annually with local fire departments and EMS to ensure successful emergency response.  \n\n\n\nTropicana is dedicated to the safety of our employees and the surrounding communities.  We apply health & safety and PSM/RMP practices, in order to comply with company standards and other requirements.  We conduct regular audits to verify compliance. Over the previous five years, Tropicana has had no ammonia releases that resulted in any off-site impacts.\n\n\n\nTropicana has and will continue to be a leader in the industry for safe operations of ammonia refrigeration systems.  Our commitment to Process Safety Management and Emergency Response is embraced at all levels of the organization.  Tropicana's goal is for continuous improvement in all aspects of the Risk Management Program to greatly reduce or eliminate the possibility of an ammonia release."
