The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this resubmission is to reflect changes in: ownership and company name; change to titles; and change to dates of accident prevention elements that were affected by the Management of Change and Pre-Startup Review.  A Management of Change was implemented in response to the PHA Review performed on 5.19.2020.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  The covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\no    Covered Process 1: Storage & Handling (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending (Ammonium Polyphosphate)\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is transported to this Facility by a Contractor owned and operated commercial tanker truck.  The Contractor transfers anhydrous ammonia from the commercial tanker truck to a single 30,000-gallon stationary PV.  \n\n\n\nThe Facility hires a Contactor (A.K.A. Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor - IFRC) to transfer and blend anhydrous ammonia with super phosphoric acid and water to make ammonium polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer.  The APP liquid fertilizer is blended in a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by the Contractor.  The APP liquid fertilizer is not subject to the PSM/RMP rules.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and altern"

      "FacilityID": 1000091326,
      "SummaryText": "ative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes.  The worst case release scenario is the same for the both covered processes because the largest vessel (i.e. a 30,000-gallon pressure vessel) is common to both covered processes when connected, and the MPR is not capable of storing anhydrous ammonia.  The worst case release scenario assumes that all the content in the largest vessel is released.   The release scenario consists of the pressure vessel being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are also the same for the two covered processes because the Commercial Tanker Truck and MPR are both connected to the stationary pressure vessel by a transfer hose.  The alternative consequence analysis for the Transport Truck and MPR assumes that a 3-inch liquid transfer hose fails during a transfer and/or blending process.  The alternative scenario for the Transport Truck and MPR considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. emergency shutoff valves and excess flow valve on the Truck or MPR, and excess flow valves on the pressure vessel side of the bulkhead), and operating procedures that the Facility and Contractor implement to safeguard against ammonia releases from transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe General Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The General Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The General Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Accident Prevention Program elements.  The General Manager is responsible for managing the Contractor in accordance with the Facility PSM/RMP Contractor management program.  The Contractor is responsible for training its personnel in the implementation of its OSHA PSM.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is a non-responding "
