The facility handles quantities of propane in excess of the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Planning (RMP) threshold planning quantity for a flammable substance. The facility is considered a RMP program 3 facility.\n\nThe facility receives propane via a U.S. Department of Transportation-regulated pipeline, stores propane in eleven 75,000 gallon \"bullet\" tanks (\"water\" capacity), and loads propane onto highway trucks using two truck loading racks and product pumps. The facility also has storage capacity for up to 12,000 pounds of ethyl mercaptan, an odorant that is injected into the propane for safety.\n\nThe facility is subject to and complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) regulations, including the process safety management (PSM) requirements.  The facility also prepares and provides annual SARA Tier II Chemical Inventory reports to the State Emergency Planning Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and local fire department.  \n\nThe facility has process controls in place, including: automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment.  In addition, the facility has UV/IR fire detection \"eyes\" process area detectors. A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted every five years as part of the OSHA PSM requirements. \n\nFacility personnel undergo operations competency training and testing, and emergency response training. The facility is inspected and audited on a compliance schedule.\n\nThe maximum quantity of propane that could be stored on site is 734,000 gallons (3,127,000 pounds).  The worst case release scenario is failure of one \"bullet\" tank of propane filled to the greatest amount allowed, 66,700 gallons (284,100 pounds), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst case scenario vapor cloud explosion would potentially affect nearby public recep"
