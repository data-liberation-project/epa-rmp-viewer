      "SummaryText": "1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe following Risk Management Program / Accidental Release Prevention Plan has been\nprepared for the E.F. Oxnard, Inc. (E.F. Oxnard) facility located at 550 Diaz Avenue in Oxnard\n(see Figure 1).  This facility is engaged in energy production and distribution and operates two\nammonia systems.  This RMP has been prepared pursuant to Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5\nof the California Code of Regulations.\n\nThis RMP covers two anhydrous ammonia systems. The first system is a selective catalytic\noxidizer (SCR) unit that uses ammonia to control nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the\nnatural gas fired turbine and the HRSG duct.  The ammonia for this system is stored in a\n12,000 gallon tank and gravity fed to a vaporizer where it is conveyed to the SCR unit. The\nmaximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this system is 10,500 gallons, or 54,220\npounds as specified in the facility PSM document.  \n\nThe second system is the Aqua Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration Plant (AAARP). In this\nsystem, steam from the turbine is used to power a refrigeration cycle.  The ammonia process\npiping of the AAARP is connected to the Boskovich Farms, Inc. (Boskovich) refrigeration\nsystem and runs independently from the SCR ammonia process.  Although this system is\nphysically located to the south on the neighboring Boskovich property, it is included in this\nRMP because E.F. Oxnard owns and operates the AAARP and leases the land on which the\nsystem is located from Boskovich. The AAARP system contains approximately 2,000 gallons\n(10,300 lb) of aqueous ammonia at various concentrations. \n\nBecause more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia is used in a single process, this facility is\nsubject to Program 3 requirements.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTo prevent the accidental release of ammonia, E.F. Oxnard has developed the following: \n\n- Maintenance procedures to ensure that equipment is properly maintained and functioning\nproperly.\n- Operat"

This scenario\nwas chosen so that the maximum risk posed by each system could be compared based on\nequivalent analyses.\n\nAlternate Scenario 3 (A3):    Small leak from a pump seal in high pressure anhydrous portion\nof AAARP equipment.\n\nIn order to reduce the severity of an accidental release, the following administrative controls\nand mitigation measures are in place at E.F. Oxnard:\n\n- Maintenance procedures to ensure that equipment is properly maintained and functioning\nproperly.\n- Operating procedures to ensure that equipment is operated in a manner that minimizes the\npossibility of an ammonia release.\n- Employee training to ensure that operators know how to properly use the equipment and\nnon-operators are aware of the dangers of ammonia and the necessary steps to take in the\nevent of an ammonia release.\n- Fencing around the site to minimize the possibility of a third party damaging equipment or\nreleasing ammonia.\n- Ammonia sensors to detect ammonia releases. \n\nDetails regarding the Offsite Consequence Analysis for the worst case and alternative release\nscenarios can be found in Section 3.0 of this document.\n\f1.4  General Accidental Release Prevention Program Components and Substance Specific\nPrevention Steps\n\nThe following components are contained in the following sections of this Risk Management\nPlan document:\n\n- Registration\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis\n- Five-year Accident History\n- Program Specific Component\n- Emergency Response Program\n- Certification\n- Update Procedure\n\nIn order to further mitigate the effects of an ammonia release, the following risk management\ncomponents are in place:\n\n- Maintenance and standard operating procedures for the ammonia systems.\n- The site is prevented from being accessed by trespassers with the use of fencing and\n24-hour"

Oxnard has had one incident in the past five years from the ammonia system that resulted\nin off site injuries that required medical attention.  It is estimated that approximately 10\ngallons (51.5 lb) of aqueous ammonia vapor was released through a pressure safety valve.\nThis incident is discussed in Section 4.0.\n\n1.6  Emergency Response Plan Components\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the E.F. Oxnard facility, titled Hazardous Substances\nControl Plan, has been prepared and contains information for responding to an ammonia\nrelease.  The general emergency response policy for the site when ammonia is released is to\nevacuate to an area upwind of the release (if necessary) and notify the appropriate personnel\nand authorities.\n\n1.7  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn the original process hazard analysis (PHA) there were several recommendations made to\nimprove safety at the facility. These changes are summarized in Section 5 of this document.\nThe original recommendations have been implemented and there are no new planned changes\nto improve safety at this time.\n\nThe facility was constructed according to Uniform Building Code (UBC) Level 4 Seismic design criteria.  Current guidance from the CalARP Program Seismic Guidance Committee dated September 1998 and approved by the Region 1 Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) on January 1, 1999 indicates that more stringent requirements of newer UBC versions may apply.  To ensure adequate seismic safeguards are in place at the facility, a seismic study will be conducted within the next year."
