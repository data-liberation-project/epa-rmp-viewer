Waters, President & Owner\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\n\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Wen Mar Farms, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for the use of the owner and for sale to local farmers.\n\n\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 160,000 pounds in our two-18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi trailer holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\n     A.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 80,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 5.1 miles.\n\n\n\n     B.  The alternative release scenario based on five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the America"

The Five-year Accident History (either a or b).\n\n\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n     - to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n\n\n     - The facility has:\n\n\n\n     a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\n     b.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. We revised our operating procedures to include steps for maintenance safety and shutdown instructions.  There are no other additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations or implementation at this time."
