We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the risk for all stakeholders. This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to prevent and mitigate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response   personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release. We also coordinate with the Houston Ship Channel Area's Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) organization, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nThe site has installed new equipment to purify isobutylene in the Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether process.  A new isobutylene storage sphere and railcar loading facilities will be installed and operational in the third quarter of 2014.  This submittal includes predictive filing for the increased storage and railcar inventories.  As part of the overall review of the re-submission, the regulated substances and inventories were reviewed and modifications have been made accordingly.  \n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOur facility produces a number of products that include Propylene Oxide (PO), Styrene Monomer (SM), Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), Ethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (ETBE), Polyether Polyols (Polyols), and an assortment of products from the Butanediols (BDO) unit, including Allyl Alcohol (AA).

EO is a primary feedstock of the Polyols unit.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia (NH3): Approximately 67,000 lbs. of NH3 are stored on-site to be utilized in the control of Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) in the Utilities area.\n\n\n\nFlammables - \n\n\n\nPropylene: Approximately 257,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site. Propylene is the primary feedstock for both of the PO units.\n\n\n\nEthylene: Approximately 32,000 lbs. are contained in a pipeline and is used as a primary feedstock for the production of Ethylbenzene in the two PO/SM units.\n\n\n\nIsobutylene: Approximately 9.2 million lbs. will be contained in the new storage sphere, railcars and within the process of the RTBE unit. Isobutylene is an intermediate chemical used in the production of RTBE and with the new equipment, is purified for selling as finished product.\n\n\n\nFlammable Mixtures:  Approximately 13 million lbs. of flammable mixtures are stored and processed through-out the PO/SM, BDO, and RTBE units and (un)loading areas.

Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews and recommend corrective actions to prevent accidents.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly thru a review during any operator training opportunity.  They are also reviewed every five years.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified as a result of management of change activities or after completed of a process PHA. Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a process unit.\n\n\n\nOperator Training / Qualification Program: A training and testing program is in place to ensure that operators have the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.
