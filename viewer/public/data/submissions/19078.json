If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primar activity at the facility is the storage and transfer from our storage tank into nurse tanks. This product is used as a crop nutrient by our farmer customers. The maximum quanity stored at this facility is 79,000 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nThe worst case release scenatio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 79,000, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.89 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on th five year accident history is a release from a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\nThe facility has made every attempt to comply with the state regulations regarding anhydrous ammonia. The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture inspects our facility on a regular basis. We have completed training according to industry standards and using quality  training materials designed to help us understand proper operating procedures, emergency procedures and maintenance procedures.\n\nOn 8-26-98 we had an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia which caused injury to one of our employees. The ammount released was less than 5 pounds and was less than 1 minute long. Operator mistakes led to this unfortunate accident.  Training and review of proper procedures were implemented after this accident. There were no offsight consequences from this accidental release.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan which inclu"
