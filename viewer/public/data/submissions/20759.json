Although the amount released was very small we did have an employee that was injured in the accident.  There were no offsite injuries or evacuations that occurred.  \nOur emergency response program is coordinated with the local LEPC and through our local 911 system.  This will notify all local emergency responders.  All employees that work with chlorine have had training.  They have had Chlorine Awareness Classes, Operational Classes, and Technical Training for the handling of chlorine gas.  With these classes the employees have completed the level of training as a Hazardous Materials Technician which would make them our first responders in the event of an accident.  In 1999 they received a refresher course which the city requires.  The city has had 3 emergency drills hel"

In our policy at the plant and on file with the LEPC is the evacuation areas for 8 different release scenarios.\nBy the end of the year 2000 the city wil not be usiing chlorine gas as a disinfection agent.  We will switch our process to sodium hypochlorite for disinfection and sodium bisulfite for dechlorination."
