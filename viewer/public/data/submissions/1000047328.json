Subsidiary concerns are minimization of damage to the environment or Knouse Foods equipment, property and product as well as compliance with the regulations.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System Cold Storage No. 1\n\nKnouse Foods, Peach Glen Plant is a process and storage facility for apples. The facility is equipped with an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system serving coolers, freezers, and production water chillers. The total system capacity of refrigerant is 12,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was calculated to be the failure of the largest single ammonia storage vessel in the refrigeration system. The vessel holds 12,000 pounds of ammonia during normal operating charge. 12,000 pounds would be released for a worst-case scenario. The off-site consequences analysis for the worst-case release scenario was modeled using the EPA's browser-based program RMP*Comp. The release duration was 10 minutes with a release rate 660 pounds per minute (lbs/min). Mitigation measures considered included release into the building. The results of the modeling indicated that the toxic endpoint of 0.14 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of ammonia would be reached at a distance of 1.0 miles from the release point.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumed that a leak develops in the piping system of the refrigeration system. Based on the current ammonia detection systems and procedures for quickly responding to the alarm, it was assumed that 250 pounds of ammonia would be released. The off-site consequences a"

Mitigation measures considered included release into the building. The results of the modeling indicated that the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia would be reached at less than 0.1 mile from the release point.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nKnouse Foods has developed and implemented a PSMP in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Standard 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, for operation of the ammonia refrigeration system at Knouse Foods, Peach Glen Plant. The PSMP has been revised to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations, 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe PSMP and RMP for the Knouse Foods, Peach Glen Plant includes detailed sections on the following:\n\n\n\n    Employee Participation\n\n    Process Safety Information\n\n    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n    Operating Procedures\n\n    Training\n\n    Contractor Safety\n\n    Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n    Mechanical Integrity\n\n    Hot Work\n\n    Management of Change\n\n    Incident Investigation\n\n    Emergency Planning and Response\n\n    Compliance Audits\n\n    Off-site Consequences Analysis.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the PSMP and RMP, Knouse Foods maintains the following documents as part of the safety program at Knouse Foods, Peach Glen Plant:\n\n\n\n    On-site Emergency Response Plan, Peach Glen , Pa.

There have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the system in the last five years.  \n\n \n\n"
