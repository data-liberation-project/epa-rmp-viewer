ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\n\n\nThe emergency response procedures are detailed in the TLC/Sara Lee Northeast Mixing Center Emergency and Hazardous Materials Response Plans and Procedures. These manuals were designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n                                     \n\n1) To save lives.\n\n2) To minimize and avoid injuries. \n\n3) To protect the environment and the public.\n\n4) To minimize property damage. \n\n  \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan and Procedures provides the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation. All employees are trained in their specific roles when responding to an emergency. The manuals are kept in strategic locations throughout the facilities and are readily available to all employees. \n\n\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE  \n\n \n\n The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of vessels, interconnecting piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment. \n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its te"

Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is latter removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from 5\" hg on the low side to 150 psig on the high side. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process. \n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 12,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nC.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY    \n\n\n\nThere have been no reported releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years (new facility ammonia chargered 10/10/07).\n\n\n\nE. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nTLC's Emergency Response Program is described in their Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Ryder Northeast Mixing Center. \n\nThis plan includes planned responses and procedures for evacuation.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThere have been numerous changes to the facility to improve process chemical safety as a result of PSM and RMP implementation. TLC/Sara Lee Northeast Mixing Center will maintain PSM /RMP programs for continued process safety improvement. This will be accomplished through audits, PHA revalidations, training, mechanical integrity testing and inspections. The facility is in the process of  guarding evaporators and correcting P&ID's."
