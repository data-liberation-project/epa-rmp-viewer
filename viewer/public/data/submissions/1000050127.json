WACKER Charleston continually strives to meet or exceed all applicable Environmental, Health, Safety and Security laws, regulations and other requirements in all of its operations at all of its facilities.\n\n\n\nAt the WACKER Charleston, TN site, we seek to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances through a combination of robustly engineered equipment, use of proven, highly reliable chemical processes and advanced technology that minimizes reliance on human responses.  WACKER's approach also involves extensive training of our chemical operations team members in the many detailed operating procedures that have been developed.  We inspect our facility thoroughly on a frequent and regular basis to ensure that any issues that are found are addressed before they become significant concerns.\n\n\n\nWACKER's commitment to protecting people and the environment extends to its approach to emergency preparedness and response.  To ensure that the effects of any releases that do occur are minimized, Wacker has established a full-time, fully trained professional fire department and emergency response team equipped with \"state-of-the-art\" response equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nB)  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Wacker Charleston Site is a chemical manufacturing facility that produces hyper-pure crystalline polysilicon for the solar energy and semi-conductor industries.  The site operates on a continuous basis, seven days per week.  The highly integrated and interconnected process is divided into production units with specific functions that operate independently.  \n\n\n\nWACKER uses several regulated substances above threshold quantities to manufacture polysilicon.  \n\n\n\nIn compliance with RMP requirements, Wacker has conducted "

EPA 40 CFR 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (Risk Management Plans)\n\n? OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n\n? OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120(q) - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response (Emergency response program to hazardous substance releases)\n\n? Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n\n? Recognized and generally accepted engineering practices, codes and standards, and\n\n? WACKER Environmental, Health, Safety and Security standard procedures\n\n\n\nThe chemical accident prevention / process safety management program includes the following elements:\n\n- Employee Participation\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n- Operating Procedures\n\n- Process Operations & Maintenance Procedures Training\n\n- Contractor Safety\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\n\n- Safe Work Permit system that includes Hot Work, Lockout/Tagout, Opening of Pipelines and Confined Space Entry\n\n- Management of Change\n\n- Incident Investigation\n\n- Emergency Preparedness and Response\n\n- Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nThe following engineering and administrative controls help prevent releases of regulated substances:\n\n- the regulated substances, in both liquid and gaseous forms, are produced, stored, used and recovered within dedicated process equipment \n\n- bulk quantities of flammable liquids awaiting further processing are contained in double-wall tanks installed below ground to protect them from impact or other hazards (e.g., fire); \n\n- there are alarms and sensors installed within equipment that prevent overfilling of process vessels and tanks by "

The Fire Department employs site Emergency Action Plans when responding to any type of site emergency.  The Emergency Action Plans take into account different types of emergencies that could foreseeably occur.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency requiring assistance from outside agencies, WACKER personnel will make all required notifications.  The Wacker Fire Department staff, working in conjunction with the applicable local, state and federal agency representatives, will jointly decide on how to ensure neighboring communities and property are protected.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release of one or more of the regulated substances or other hazardous material, our facility Fire Department would use chemical-specific and unit-specific response plans and procedures to address the emergency at the earliest stage possible so as to prevent escalation of the incident.  In plant locations where there is recognized fire potential, automatic fire protection systems ha"

We work with the Bradley County Fire and Rescue Department to conduct facility tours for personnel who may one day have to respond, to support required facility inspections and to provide opportunities for joint training exercises.\n\n\n\nProfessional technicians test our fire protection system on a monthly basis, including signals, alarms and sprinkler protection of specified processing areas.  Similarly, service technicians perform monthly inspections and service on our respiratory protection equipment, and annual inspections on all fire extinguishers.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel test our fire pumps, safety showers and eyewash stations on a weekly basis.  Facility personnel also conduct regular testing of the uninterruptable power supply and emergency power generators, which will allow the facility to operate in a limited capacity to maintain process safety in the event of a major electrical power interruption from our supplier.\n\n\n\nSite personnel who are members of the Fire Department participate in frequent training and drills.  They also receive training on emergency response procedures and the proper use of protective and response equipment.   The Fire Department will maintain both the chemical protective clothing and response equipment.\n\n\n\nF) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWacker Charleston continually seeks to improve its processes through advancements in technology and automation.  The newly constructed hyper-pure polysilicon facility is state of the art and represents the culmination of 50 years of polysilicon manufacturing experience.  With every project, Wacker still seeks further to improve quality and enhance safety and environmental protection.  Following the release incident in September 2017 which led to the temporary sh"
