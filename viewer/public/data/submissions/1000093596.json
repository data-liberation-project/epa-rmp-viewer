(RSI) - Hempstead Facility was constructed and began chemical blending operations in 1998. RSI is a specialty chemical manufacturer and oilfield service provider. The company formulates and manufactures treatment chemicals for the oilfield industry, which includes upstream exploration and production (E&P) facilities, distribution networks (gathering systems and pipelines), and gas plants, as well as downstream segments such as storage terminals and refineries.\r\n \r\nRSI places a strong emphasis on safety and environmental leadership. The company employs a proactive approach to managing environment, health and safety (EHS) throughout its operations to ensure that RSI employees work safely, workplace/job site hazards are mitigated or eliminated, environmental impacts are minimized, and that each facility remains in full compliance with applicable federal, state, county, and local laws and regulations. RSI is also committed to environmental stewardship within the communities it serves.\r\n \r\n2) Description of the Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\r\n \r\nThe Refinery Specialties Inc. - Hempstead Facility is subject to Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r) Accidental Release Prevention/Risk Management Plan Rule requirements under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68) due to the use of formaldehyde in a manufacturing process. The facility exceeds the qualifying threshold of 15,000 pounds of this chemical on-site for a single process.\r\n \r\nBulk formaldehyde solution (34 - 37% concentration by weight) is delivered to the facility via tanker truck. The formaldehyde is off-loaded and stored as a liquid in one of three 5000-gallon stainless steel storage tanks. The maximum inventory of formaldehyde stored at the facility is approximately 51,000 lbs. The formal"

The formaldehyde storage tanks and two dedicated reactor vessels are plumbed together in such a way as to create a closed-loop system, with storage tank vents and pressure relief valves (PRVs) routed to a scrubber system. The reactor vessels have capacities of 5000-gallons and 8600-gallons, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe formaldehyde and bulk tank storage areas, which are partially enclosed and completely under roof, are equipped with dedicated secondary containment (12 and 18 concrete dike walls, respectively) that both minimizes the surface area of a potential spill and provides adequate containment. In addition, a 6 curb extends around the perimeter of the Building 4 footprint, and incorporates personnel and vehicle/forklift access points. The floor surface near each external roll-up door is sloped upwards. This area provides additional spill containment for both in-process material and finished product, and serves as primary secondary containment in the event of an accidental spill or release at the either of the reactor vessels. \r\n\r\nAs a result of these design features, employee training, and routine inspections, as well as the nature of the regulated process itself (relatively low temperature and low/negative pressure when in operation), RSI has not experienced an accidental release of formaldehyde since process start-up. Off-site first responders for emergencies include the community fire department and contract spill response services, as required.\r\n \r\n3) Brief Description of the Worst Case Scenario, including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for each Reported Scenario.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is based on the release of the greatest amount of chemical held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity stored. The EPA has developed accident assessment methods in coop"

Trade/industry associations such as the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), and the American Petroleum Institute (API) have also contributed to the joint development of release evaluation methods.\r\n\r\nThe current recommended release evaluation methodology is contained in the EPA RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis dated March 2009 (OCA Guideline). The OCA Guideline specifies the performance of an accidental release analysis as part of an RMP Plan prepared for facilities with total hazardous material quantities on site in excess of EPA thresholds. The threshold quantity for formaldehyde solution is 15,000 pounds. The OCA Guideline is used for this analysis.  Under a worst-case scenario, a single vessel containing 5,000 gallons of 37% formaldehyde is assumed to release with complete indoor containment in the production building housing the regulated process, i.e. within Building 4. \r\n\r\nThe RMP*Comp software requires the user to input the scenario type, chemical concentration, liquid temperature, quantity released, and surrounding terrain type. The scenario type was selected to be worst case. The chemical concentration is 37% formaldehyde in water. The liquid temperature is ambient (specified to be 77 degrees Fahrenheit). The quantity released is the total amount of formaldehyde in 5000-gallons of 37% formaldehyde solution, calculated to be 17,057 pounds. The facility is located in a predominantly rural area that is generally free of significant vertical obstacles, therefore the terrain type was selected to be rural.
