This Risk Management Plan has been developed for The City of Breaux Bridge's Waste Water Treatment Plant in accordance with 40 CFR part 68.  This facility is subject to the requirements of this program due to the usage and storage of chlorine in an amount greater than 2,500 lbs.\n\nThe facility is located within the city limits of Breaux Bridge, LA at the end of Begnaud St. The area to the northeast of the plant is residential and the remaining area is swampland and farmland.  The latitude and longitude of the facility was obtained using a hand-held  Garmin 75 GPS device with an accuracy of +/- 100 meters.  The facility is easily visible on the USGS quadrangle map entitled Breaux Bridge, LA.\n\nThe facility treats waste water from residential and commercial entities in Breaux Bridge.  This treatment includes the chlorination of the water supply prior to being disposed of into the nearby swampland.  A continuous rate of chlorine is mixed with water in the injection room.  Once the chlorine is injected into the water it is diluted to an amount which is less than 1% chlorine by weight.  The chlorine-water mixture is then routed to the contact chamber where the waste water is treated.  The process that is subject to the RMP requirements begins with the chlorine supply (2-1 ton cylinders) and ends at the point where it is mixed with the water.  The facility uses approximately one cylinder of chlorine each week.  The waste water plant stores a maximum of two-one ton cylinders and five 150 lbs. cylinders (4,750 lbs.) at any one time. The one ton cylinders are located behind the control room under a metal shed.  The 150 lb cylinders are used as backup when needed and are stored in the control room.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would involve the release of the greatest amount from a single vessel as required by 40 CFR part 68.25 (b)-Determination of worst-case release quantity. This type of release may occur as a result of"

      "SummaryText": "catastrophic natural or other unforeseen disaster.  A release of 2,000 lbs. for a duration of 10 minutes results in a 1.3 mile distance to the toxic endpoint.  This endpoint, developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association, is the location where minimal effects of exposure to the toxic substance are likely to occur.  This distance encompasses approximately three-fourths of the city of Breaux Bridge from Hwy 31 at Hebert Ave. to Cormier Dr. and from the water treatment plant on Washington St. to 1.3 miles into the swamp to the southwest of the plant.  According to a January 1999 letter from the Treasurer of the State of Louisiana the population of Breaux Bridge is approximately 7,600.  It is estimated that the worst-case circle encompasses 75% of the population (5700). \n\nAn alternative case or a more likely release of chlorine could occur as a result of a valve, regulator seal, or gasket leak.  The plant is equipped with a leak detection system that has sensors located near the chlorine cylinders and in the injection room.  The injection system is also equipped with a device that automatically closes the valves at the cylinders if a loss in pressure within the injection line is detected.  If a 1 ppm leak is detected an alarm will sound and according to facility personnel, it would take less than 1 minute for on-site personnel to respond by closing the flow valve and thus stopping the leak.  Assuming the chlorine flashes to the atmosphere at a rate of 0.5 ft3/min for a maximum of 5 minutes (0.5 lbs. of chlorine) the distance to the toxic endpoint is less than 0.1 mile.  The area within 0.1 mile of the facility consist mostly of the sewage disposal ponds and partial coverage of Alva Dr. and Goldie Dr.  Based on a  maximum population density of 8,268 p/mi2, the population within 0.1 mile of the facility is approximately 65.

      "SummaryText": "n the alternative-case release circle is approximately 20.  This type of release is only expected to impact those persons in the immediate vicinity of the chlorine cylinders. \n\nThe facility has not experienced a release which caused on or off site injury, death or property damage within the past five years.  \n\nFacility employees are properly trained in the operating and maintenance procedures.  These procedures are kept on-site in the O & M Manuals developed by Domingue-Szabo & Associates, Inc.  Records of inspections, testing, and maintenance are also kept on file at the facility.  In addition to the leak detection system the process is also equipped with an automatic shut-off system.  If a change in pressure within the injection line is detected the system automatically closes the flow valve at  the chlorine tank.\n\nWritten emergency response procedures are kept on file at the facility.  The emergency response procedures describe actions for incidental response for facility personnel in the event of a relatively small leak or release that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  If incidental response activities do not halt the release or the release poses an immediate safety or health hazard, specially trained response personnel are contacted to take over response activities.  In the event of a chlorine leak or release, employees are instructed to asses the situation and to determine if it is safe to discontinue the leak without the help of emergency responders.  If there are any doubts as to the safety of the release, the employees are to initiate the written notification procedures.\n\nCurrent safety features installed at the facility include the leak detection system and metal shed to protect the cylinders from the heating effects of direct sunlight.  Inspections of the process and associated equipment are conducted on a regular basis to avoid failure and detect normal wear and tear of equipment parts."
