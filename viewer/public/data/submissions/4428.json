Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.                To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods (TDC 402 W Olrich Rogers AR), this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods (TDC 402 W Olrich Rogers AR), has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n    (Brief description of the facility: TDC is a 248,556 sq. ft. cold storage facility. Temperatures         range from +40 on the dock, -10 in the freezer, to -25 in the blast.)\n\n    (Use of regulated substances: Ammonia)\n\n    (Amount of each regulated substance.

Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n       \nWorst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing  (18,500) pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.
