The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  At times, for short periods, the nurse tanks on site maybe filled to approximately 85% capacity.  The nurse tanks are designed for the purpose of containing anhydrous ammonia.    This anhydrous ammonia facility is in operation of receiving and distributing product only on a seasonal basis (approximately three months of the year), the balance of the year it is used for storage of product. \n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario \n\n\n\nAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).  In the event of an accidental release or emergency it is the policy of Agrineed, Inc.  employees to immediatel"
