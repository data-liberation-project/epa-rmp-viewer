      "SummaryText": "es\n\n\n\nSafeway is dedicated to operation of a safe facility for its employees and neighboring community. A safety committee has been established that is responsible for the implementation of the safety program and an Emergency Response Plan.  This includes safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. Safeway has prepared risk and safety programs to ensure safe handling of the ammonia in the refrigeration system. Recently Safeway Inc. conducted a Process Hazard Analysis to identify potential hazards and the appropriate mitigation measures. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\n1. The Safeway facility is located at 3520 Pacific Ave S in Auburn, Washington. The facility started operations at this location in 2005. Ammonia (NH3) is being used as the refrigerant. The total quantity of ammonia was calculated to be 63,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n2. The Safeway ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of piping, valves and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment. \n\n\n\n3. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 0 psig on the low-pressure side of each system to 185 psig on the high side. \n\n\n\n4. Ammonia is the regulated substance at this facility.\n\n\n\n5. The maximum inventory of ammonia at the facility is 58,500 pounds.\n\n\n\nSafeway has an accidental release prevention progra"

The International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) \"Guide to the Implementation of Process Safety Management (PSM) for Ammonia Refrigeration\" was as one of several sources to implement the PSM program at the Facility. Parts of the program include:\n\n\n\n1. Employee Participation\n\n2. Process Safety Information\n\n3. Process Safety Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n4. Operating Procedures\n\n5. Training\n\n6.

Emergency Planning and Response\n\n13. Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history reveals that there have been no significant releases of ammonia that met the EPA RMP definition of \"accident\" in the last five years (January 2015 - January 2020).  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency action plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility:\n\n\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated incident commander for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel receive annual training regardin"

In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger.  The plant manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem.  Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, was conducted for the produce warehouse on January 14-15, 2020.  The PHA study provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  The safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
