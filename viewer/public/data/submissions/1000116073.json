This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of TETRA\u0092s processes. TETRA's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n2.0  DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nTETRA is located in an agricultural area that borders West Memphis, Arkansas. TETRA produces zinc bromide, calcium bromide, and sodium bromide blends in water solutions that are used as high-density workover and completion fluids in the oil and gas industry. TETRA also produces zinc chloride that is used to manufacture electrolyte fluid for flow batteries. \n\nTETRA was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold of EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program Rule. Based on process knowledge, TETRA personnel identified no listed flammable substances and two toxic regulated substances kept on site above threshold quantities. The chemicals, largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.  Largest Quantity of Regulated Substance.\nRegulated Substance\tLargest Quantity Onsite (lbs)\tThreshold Quantity (lbs)\nBromine\t238,740\t10,000\nChlorine\t48,000\t2,500\n\n\n3.0  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\n\t\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at TETRA. The processes at TETRA regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard. Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the"

The PSI is useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process Safety Information is readily available to all employees.\n\nTETRA keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).\n\nTETRA also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n3.2  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nTETRA has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTETRA primarily uses the hazard a"

However, as situations warrant, TETRA will use other inductive techniques such as what-if/checklist analysis. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project, plant manager or knowledgeable plant personnel, a person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis, and others with particular expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team. The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency). This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for these processes was intended to:\n\u0095\tIdentify credible causes, consequences, and safeguards for deviations from normal operating conditions, which could lead to personnel injury, environmental effects, equipment damage, impact on reputation, significant capital loss, production loss, or reduction in produ"

The review is to ensure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities. To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and, most importantly, communicated to employees. Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in completing the stated procedures.

Prior to changes being made, they are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel, including contractor employees, are provided any necessary training regarding the change.\n\n3.7  Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nTETRA conducts a PSSR on any new facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and subject chemicals into service. This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and are adequate.  \n\n3.8  Compliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, TETRA periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action(s) to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The reports are maintained for five years.\n\nAn investigation team is established to investigate each process incident. The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, a contract employee (if the incident involved the work of a contractor), and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. The investigation team documents its findings in a report. The report includes dates of the incident and investigation, description of the incident, factors contributing to the incident, and develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, these results are forwarded to the business management team for resolution.\n\n3.10  Employee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of TETRA\u0092s PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.
