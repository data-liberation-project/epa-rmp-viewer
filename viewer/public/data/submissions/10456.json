Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committees, area volunteer fire departments, and local emergency response units.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.\n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes every effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility produces maleic anhydride by the oxidation of butane and air in the presence of a catalyst.  Butane is the single regulated substance handled above the regulatory threshold quantity.  Butane is piped to the facility as a raw material from the Catlettsburg Refinery into three storage tanks.  The facility also receives supplemental truck deliveries of butane.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel is released.  This event is highly unlikely and has"

      "SummaryText": " never occurred at our facility.  The USEPA also requires the worst-case scenario for butane to be a vapor cloud explosion of the released material.  Vapor cloud explosions are extremely rare events, even when large quantities of flammable materials are released.   Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario for butane could potentially affect off-site receptors.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered process.  These  procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with top management and quickly communicate key first-aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in the event of an emergency.  \n\nFive-year accident history. \n\nDuring the past five years, we have not had a release of the regulated substance that resulted in or could have resulted in an off-site impact.  \n\nThe emergency response program. \n\nOur employees do not respond to accidental chemical releases of the regulated substance, but rely on local emergency responders.   Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response activities.  Our facilities regularly invite the local fire department and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, gain familiarity with our operations, and participate in joint emergency drills.
