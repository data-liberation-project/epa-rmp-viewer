The public is also aware that a Prevention Program \nexists at the facility.  Process 1 falls under Program Level 3 and hence \na Prevention Program for Program Level 3 was developed and implemented \nfor the NAICS Code 33121.\nThe facility follows an Emergency Response Plan that takes due care of \nany accidents that may occur at the facility.  \nAlso, the facility's ER Plan includes specific steps that are taken to\nprevent an accidental release as well as chemical specific prevention \nsteps to be taken in response to accidental releases of the regulated \nsubstance, Anhydrous Ammonia.\nFurther the plan includes information on emergency healthcare.\nAlso, the review of the ER Plan was done on 6/15/99.  \nThe facility's ER Plan details exactly how the facility coordinates with \nthe Westmoreland County Department of Public Safety on program review, \ntraining and inspections.\nAt Dormont, the Emergency Planning Committee members are annually \nreviewing existing processes for any deficiencies within the system for\nthe purposes of ensuring our employees the safest workplace possible.\nThe worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenarios were \ncalculated utilizing the EPA OCA Analysis Guidelines.  Along with the \nguidelines, Dormont has developed administrative controls such as;  \nloading of Ammonia on off-shifts and fair weather conditions, as well as \nnumerous mitigation measures including, but not limited to a"
