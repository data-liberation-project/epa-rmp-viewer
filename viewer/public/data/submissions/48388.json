      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Rancho California Water District (RCWD) Santa Rosa Water Reclamation Facility is located in Murrieta in Riverside County, California. The facility includes chlorine use for disinfection, and sulfur dioxide for removal of chlorine residual. \n\nThe chlorine system consists of the chlorine bulk storage system, chlorinators, chlorine rapid mix basins, and chlorine contact basins. Chlorine is stored onsite in sixteen, one-ton cylinders (8 duty, 8 standby).  During normal operations, chlorine is withdrawn from the cylinders and the gaseous chlorine is fed by chlorinators to injectors which mix chlorine with water, forming a solution.  The RCWD water department also stores a maximum of 60 @ 150 pound cylinders in the chlorine room.  \n\nThe dechlorination system consists of sulfur dioxide storage and sulfonators. The sulfur dioxide storage consists of eight, one-ton cylinders (4 duty, 4 standby) located inside the chlorination/dechlorination building.\n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored separately; each in a separate, 28ft by 44ft storage room of the masonry block Disinfection Building.\n\nA scrubber system is available to treat releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\n\nChemicals Subject To USEPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)\n\nRCWD uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Santa Rosa Water Reclamation Facility (SRWRF) in quantities large enough to trigger the USEPA RMP and CalARP.  The USEPA RMP threshold quantities for chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.  The CalARP threshold quantities for chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are 100 pounds and 500 pounds, respectively.  The maximum quantities present are 41,000 pounds of chlorine and 16,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are transported to the facility by truck.  SRWRF stores and uses one-ton cylinders.  There are also 1"

      "SummaryText": "50 pound cylinders stored in the chlorine room for RCWD water department use.\n\nThe RCWD Santa Rosa Water Reclamation Facility also is subject to OSHA PSM regulations for all equipment and operations associated with chlorine storage and disinfection systems, and sulfur dioxide storage and dechlorination processes.  The threshold quantities under PSM for chlorine and sulfur dioxide are 1,500 pounds and 1,000 pounds, respectively.\n\nAccidental Releases During Past Five Years\n\nThe RCWD Santa Rosa Water Reclamation Facility has not had any releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\nRCWD?s RMP programs include the following to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n? Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine storage and disinfection systems, and dechlorination systems, to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n? Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures. All procedures are reviewed and certified annually.\n? Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training is provided for all operators and maintenance staff.\n? Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same safety training that RCWD provides for its own employees.\n? Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, including documentation of all inspections.\n? Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n? Safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n? Investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases.\n? Periodic evaluation of the safety records of all outside contractors who work on the RMP-regulated systems.\n? Development of an effective emergency response program.\n? Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant"

      "SummaryText": "-wide staff are aware of the PSM/RMP program, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\n? Independent audits of the entire PSM/RMP program every three years.\n\nEmergency Response Procedures\n\nEmergency procedures are described in RCWD?s Emergency Response Plan. In the unlikely event of an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, the key elements of RCWD?s emergency response program are as follows:\n? All plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n? A team of supervisors and operators are trained, certified and equipped for hazardous materials (HAZMAT) emergency operations to repair accidental releases.\n? The plant uses a combination of visual and audible alarms and a plant loudspeaker system to alert the staff of a potential accident and to conduct in-plant communications.\n? In the event of a large release, the facility would immediately contact a telephone call-down list that includes the Riverside County Fire Department, and several nearby commercial establishments that could be affected if the wind were blowing toward them during the release.\n\nRCWD?s Recent Steps to Improve Safety\n\nBased on safety reviews that were conducted as part of the 1999 RMP implementation, RCWD has completed the following actions to either reduce the likelihood or severity of potential chemical releases:\n?     Installed a USFilter scrubber with a treatment capacity of 9,400 pounds in August 1999 to handle chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide releases.\n? Established an annual contract with USFilter to perform monthly maintenance on the chlorine/sulfur dioxide scrubber.\n? Replaced the pressure portion of the chlorination system with vacuum design.\n? Control valves/regulators are annually maintained by manufacturers.\n? Modified the Standard Operation Procedures, titled ?Chlorination Handling?, to include specific information on what operators need to do if a vacuum control valve or regulator fails.\n? Installed a leak "

Require all SRWRF visitors (RCWD staff, contractors, landscapers, etc) to sign-in/out at the Operations Building and watch a safety video.\n\nRCWD?s Proposed Steps to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the 2007 PHA safety reviews that were conducted as part of the RMP implementation, RCWD is considering the following actions to either reduce the likelihood or severity of potential chemical releases:\n? Provide an annual review of the applicable operating limits on temperature, pressure, flow and level of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems for operators.\n? Remind operators to complete a Management of Change (RMP Section 11) review for any temporary or permanent change, other than replacement in kind, affecting Cal/OSHA PSM, CalARP, and/or USEPA RMP-regulated processes, which presently include the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage areas and chlorination/dechlorination processes.  Standard Operating Procedures, also known as the ?SRWRF Chlorine Handling? and ?SRWRF Sulfur Dioxide Handling? guides, must also be updated and recertified following any process changes in accordance with the Management of Change procedure.  The Management of Change requirements have been incorporated as Item 7 in the ?SRWRF Chlorine Handling? and ?SRWRF Sulfur Dioxide Handling? guides.\n? Supplement added to RCWD Emergency Response guide to address emergency response training requirements/frequency, pre-emergency coordination activities with local community and outside responders, facility alarms, evacuation procedures, and reportable amounts of chemical release, as recommended in RMP Section 13.4.1.  \n? Schedule a compliance audit for 2007 to evaluate process safety and risk management programs and their implementation.  \n\nThe most recent compliance audit occurred in May 2002. \n"
