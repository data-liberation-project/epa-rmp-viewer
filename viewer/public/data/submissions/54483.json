These procedures are be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for training new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  \n\nThe chemical plant has identified operating limits (i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.) This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Baytown Chemical Plant utilizes a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New process technicians receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations technicians periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the chemical plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform chemical plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor company.  Chemical plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information controlled by management of change (MOC).  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to ensure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training, and safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release. \n\nExxonMobil modified its safety programs in 1991 to adopt structured environmental and safety management systems, entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, 2001 and 2007, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After extensive reviews which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard. \n \nOIMS continues to be an active part of our process safety management system program, focusing on accident prevention. The system is audited vigorously to ensure the management systems maintain a high level of effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant is located in Baytown, Harris County, Texas.  It operates to produce a variety of petrochemical products such as Butyl Rubber, polypropylene plastic, and a number of chemical intermediate feedstocks.

We believe that this approach provides the maximum safety for our employees and the community.  \n\n In addition, ExxonMobil has implemented its Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  OIMS includes aspects of EPA's prevention program.  As already mentioned, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this RMP.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  To accommodate the ever-changing nature of the database, we selected May 15, 2009, as the date to collect this information.  Most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that addresses each accident prevention program element.  A key element of the facility\u00bfs accident prevention program is the formation of safe work practice teams to promote both process and personnel safety.  The teams include members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific groups within the chemical plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the chemical plant has identified operating limits (i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.)  The chemical plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\n\nThe chemical plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide much information abo"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are appropriate.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Mitigation options are identified and evaluated. Selected mitigation options are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution and completion of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that process controls do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical Plant periodically updates"
