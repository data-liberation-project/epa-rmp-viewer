      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of City of Naples to operate safe water treatment facilities, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with our processes and reducing  any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees and the environment.  It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at the facility.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is municipal water treatment.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility. Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility is 20 tons.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario according to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document is \"the greatest amount held in a single vessel.\"  The worst-case scenario is the complete release of chlorine from a one-ton container.  The worst-case scenario may not consider the use of active mitigation such as emergency scrubbers.\n\nThe chlorine toxic endpoint defined by 40 CFR Part 68 is 0.0087 mg/l which is equivalent to 3 parts million by volume (ppm).  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG)-2, this toxic endpoint is specified as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nThe SLAB computer model was used to simulate the worst-case scenario.  The maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 2.08 miles.  This distance considered the mitigation provided by the building but did not include the use of active mitigation measures such as the "

      "SummaryText": "emergency scrubber. \n\nA worst-case release is unlikely due to the materials of construction of the chlorine container.  In addition, a comprehensive risk management program has been developed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario modeled is the worst-case scenario with the emergency scrubber in operation It is assumed that a one-ton container reputes and releases all of its contents within the Process/Chemical building.  When the release is detected, the emergency scrubber is activated. There is no off-site impact for the alternative release scenario.  This alternative release scenario is not likely to occur; however, it demonstates that off-site impacts do not occur even for the worst-case scenario when the active mitigation system is used.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCity of Naples is in compliance with 40CFR68.  The City has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the regulations.\n\nThe City has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building, and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release.  The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the likelihood of an accidental release and to minimize the impact if one occurs.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe WTP has not had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by 40 CFR 68.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Collier County Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that has been prepared in accordance with all local, state and federal regulations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe hazard review resulted in the development of a list of improvements and an implementation schedule.  This is included in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Continued training a"

Some of the more significant improvements are listed below:\n\nTo Be Completed Prior To The Next Bid For A Chemical  Supplier\n\nRequest the vendor's Standard Operating Procedures, training requirements and staff resumes for all on-site workers, as well as certification that chlorine meets AWWA specifications.\n\nProcurement documents should specify that the driver must proficiently speak and understand English.\n\nProcurement documents should specify the delivery vehicle requirements, and remind vendors that scheduling with the operator is a safety concern.\n\nContainers should meet all applicable codes and hydrostatic testing requirements.\n\nTo Be Completed by August 1999\n\nNotify vendor, in writing, about acceptable delivery vehicles.\n\nPurchase spare fuses, and replace any faulty wrenches.  Keep spare parts in stock.  Also purchase 3-position tags that denote whether a container is empty, full, or in-service.\n\nWeak or old ammonia may no longer function properly.  Staff should purchase 26  Baume  ammonia solution.\n\nDue to the chemical nature of chlorine, any work performed in the chlorine areas that involves heat or sparks should be closely monitored.   Hot work permitting should be implemented, with hot work in the chlorine area supervised by qualified plant personnel.\n\nWhen the regulator yoke is over-tightened, damage can occur.  Include proper yoke tightening methodology in staff training, and modify the current wrench to eliminate clearance/connection problems.  Remove improper wrenches from the work area.\n\nMove header and valves to a safer location.  The header and valves are currently a trip hazard.\n\nBegin testing alarms circuit and electrolyte once per week.\n\nAdd at least two fire extinguishers.  Due to the flammability of lime dust, consider installing smoke detectors in the chlorine facility, and replace them frequently.\n\nBegin annual reviews of emergency response plan, and increase "

Include inspections of the integrity of the wall as part of an overall scrubber system review.\n\nChlorine containers must be rotated in the trunnions to properly align the valves prior to connection.  Procurement of a specialized wrench for this use is recommended.\n\nTo Be Completed by November 1999\n\nProvide added protection to the chlorine building to help prevent structural damage in case of a vehicle accident. \n\nPurchase wrenches so that each ton container has a wrench.  Keep spare wrenches in stock.\n\nExisting vacuum regulators do not provide equal draw from containers.  Vacuum regulators should be replaced.\n\nA preventive maintenance (PM) and replacement program for the chlorine system should be prepared and implemented.  The PM program should include the following equipment: \n\nManual ball valve on header\nVacuum regulator\nInjector check valves\nValves on the solution line\nChlorinator\nPressure gauges\nTubing and piping, including flexible tubing\nRate controller valve \n\nConnect UPS on the chlorine system leak detectors to eliminate power loss to the alarms, and to eliminate false leak alarms.\n\nRelocate the safety shower to a better location, and test the safety showers and eye wash stations each month.\n\nTo Be Completed by January 2000\n\nExtend the driveway to allow vehicle access to empty containers.  \n\nReplace the crane/hoist, which has exceeded its effective service life.  As part of procurement of a new hoist, plan to have a breaker disconnect instead of a fusible disconnect.  Consider that the new hoist include a manual let-down.\n\nEliminate automatic valves for switch over and operate manual valve switch over, or revise system to have a pressure operated switch over system with a single regulator.\n\nReplace wooden decking in chlorine area.  This is a fire hazard."
