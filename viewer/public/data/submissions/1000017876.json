Facility continuing education programs provide employees with, but not limited to, mitigation response roles, chemical identification, evacuation procedures, hazardous release communication system, and facility security.  These efforts ensure that all facility employees will respond in a unified and coordinated response effort in the event of a chemical release.  The facility is within the Richland Hills, TX, fire department (RHFD) jurisdiction.  Additionally, RHFD is a member of an eight city combined hazmat response team.  The hazmat truck and hazmat coordinator are stationed at the North Richland Hills, TX, fire department (NRHFD).  Local response time is <3 minutes.  The unified hazmat response team response time is <8 minutes.  The hazmat team has the equipment and personal training to conduct basic air and water sampling, mitigate active leaks, conduct shelter in place and/or evacuate business and/or residence, and dike, dam, and/or divert the release.  Vapor and/or fire suppression could also be provided by the utilization of a 100 foot aerial ladder with two water nozzles and a 75 foot aerial ladder with a water nozzle.  Additional assistance can be requested from the Environmental Protection Agency Region 6 (EPAR6) located in Dallas, TX, and/or Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Emergency Response Regional Team stationed in Ft. Worth, TX. Regularly scheduled fire department building inspections ensure the facility is in compliance with local fire code requirements.\nThe facility is inspected yearly by the local fire department for national and local fire code enforcement.

Employees are also required to participate in a variety of on-line safety training courses to minimize accidents and work related injuries.  Employees participate in yearly reviews of hazards communication program training and site security programs.  These programs address procedures for illegal entry into the facility, notification process in the event of an accidental or man-made release, and basic mitigation procedures for nuisance spills.\nThe facility utilizes an outside contractor to provide \"spot\" inspections to ensure regulatory compliance.  The facility is currently utilizing voluntary inspections offered by Department of Homeland Security and OSHA to ensure regulatory compliance.  Compliance issues are brought to the attention of the facility manager and addressed in a timely manner.  Regulatory guidance is also provided to the facility in matters of regulatory reporting, waste management, and any potential training that would better prepare employees for an emergency response.  The facility voluntarily provides reporting documents to the EPA, TCEQ, DEA, and DHS.
