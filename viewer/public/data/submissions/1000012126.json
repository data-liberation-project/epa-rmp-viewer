      "SummaryText": "The Washington Township Municipal Authority (WTMA) takes pride in observing the required safety precautions in preventing hazards in the workplace, and has an emergency response plan in effect in the event of accidental releases of regulated substances. The emergency response plan is tailored for the wastewater treatment facility owned and operated by WTMA. WTMA employs the latest technology in process controls and monitoring detection systems. Active and passive mitigation systems are designed to minimize the impacts of any accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe WTMA Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) provides sewer service to residential and commercial users in Washington Township and in portions of the Borough of Waynesboro, Franklin County. The WWTP utilizes one (1) chemical onsite which is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention provisions found at 40 CFR Part 68. This toxic substance is Chlorine. Chlorine is used for disinfection of the treated wastewater prior to its discharge to the East Branch Antietam Creek. \n\n\n\nTypically, there are two (2) one-ton cylinders and two (2) 150-pound cylinders of chlorine present onsite at any given time. These vessels are located in a chemical storage building. The room containing the vessels vents to the outside. The chlorination feed system has an automatic shutoff for special circumstances. A remote alarm system is employed to notify employees of any releases of chlorine gas. Safety equipment is located nearby. The facility is manned 8 hours per day, five days per week, plus 2 hours each weekend day. An alarm sounds when vehicles pass through the entrance gate to alert plant staff of possible visitors. Gates to the facility are locked when personnel are not present so that the chlorination building is not accessible to the public. The door to the chlorine room is kept locked at all times. \n\n\n\nA prevention program policy document was developed for WTMA's WWTP in accordance with regulations found at 40 CFR A?"

      "SummaryText": "A?68.48-68.60. The facility is classified as a Program 2 facility. WTMA's Program 2 Prevention Program summarizes the pertinent safety information, hazard review procedures, operating procedures, training requirements, maintenance procedures, compliance audits and incident investigation policies. \n\n\n\nThe facility has standard operating procedures (SOPs) in effect for operation and maintenance of the chlorination system. WTMA has also developed SOPs for what-if scenarios involving chlorine emergencies. These SOPs are readily accessible to the chlorine building. Safety precautions include, checking the chlorine detector before entering the chlorine storage room, use of a face mask and other appropriate personal protective equipment, and testing for leaks with ammonia solution. A chlorine emergency kit A for 150-pound cylinders and a kit B for 1-ton cylinders are available to contain small leaks and for minor repairs. Appropriate training on the use of the chlorine kits is provided to all employees. Other training provided to plant employees includes: confined space entry, right-to-know, first aid and CPR. Documentation of the training events for each employee is maintained in employee personnel files.\n\n\n\nWTMA has an Off-Site Emergency Response Plan in effect which has been coordinated through the Franklin County LEPC. The Plan provides notification procedures, emergency response procedures, reporting requirements, and coordination efforts of all involved parties. The plan is reviewed and revised periodically to ensure contact names and telephone numbers are correct."
