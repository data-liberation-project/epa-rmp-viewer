      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for The Dow Chemical Company\nJoliet Site\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at The Dow Chemical Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturing and Distribution.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] and Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-].  Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] is stored at the Marine Terminal.  Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is also stored at the Marine Terminal.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] at our facility is 271141.00 lb. while Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 35815.91 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed PHAST 5.01.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Marine Terminal.  In this scenario 29507 lb. of Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The ent"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] involves a release from Marine Terminal.  The scenario involves the release of 271141 lb. of Ethylenediamine from the storage tank.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.49 mg/L of Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] is 0.09 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] involves a release from Marine Terminal.  The scenario involves the release of 14040 lb. of Propylene Oxide due to a hose failure during railcar unloading.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by Operator intervention.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the amount of material released.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L of Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is 0.02 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Dow Chemical Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Dow's Fire and Explosion Index, Dow's Chemical Exposure Index, and Dow's Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazard Analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 10/22/2001.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Dow Chemical Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Dow Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Dow Chemical Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at The Dow Chemical Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 08/19/2001.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at The Dow Chemical Company.  The most recent review was performed on 09/18/2001.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Dow Chemical Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 05/08/2001.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Dow Chemical Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Dow Chemical Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nThe Dow Chemical Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.
