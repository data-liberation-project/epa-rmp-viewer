This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (Tessenderlo Kerley) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Tessenderlo Kerley Facility is located in Garvin County on W. South St. in Wynnewood, Oklahoma.  The Facility is located inside the Wynnewood city limits located next to the CVR Energy Refinery.\n\nThe Facility produces and distributes chemicals, which are used in agricultural and industrial applications.  Production at the Facility consists of ammonium thiosulfate, ammonium bisulfite, and molten sulfur.  \n\nThese chemicals utilize several regulated and non-regulated substances as raw materials.  The products and raw materials require loading/unloading operations at the Facility, as well as the associated process and storage equipment.\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Tessenderlo Kerley identified no listed flammable substances and one toxic regulated substance kept on site above threshold quantities - anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe Wynnewood Facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Wynnewood Facility.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and failure mode and effect or the deductive fault tree technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.

All of this training is to be documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n Contractors\n\nThe Wynnewood Facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, there are procedures in place to ensure that contractors do as follows:\n\n perform their work in a safe manner;  \n\n have appropriate knowledge and skills;\n\n are aware of the hazards of their workplace;\n\n understand what they should do in the event of an emergency;\n\n understand and follow site specific safety rules; and\n\n inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\n\n\nThis is to be accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers the following:\n\n a process overview; \n\n information about safety and health hazards including known or potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards;\n\n emergency response plan requirements; and\n\n safe work practices must be developed and implemented regarding control of entrance, presence and exit of contract personnel prior to beginning their work. \n\nIn addition, contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor are to be evaluated.
