This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (Tessenderlo Kerley) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Tessenderlo Kerley Facility is located in Garvin County on W. South St. in Wynnewood, Oklahoma.  The Facility is located inside the Wynnewood city limits located next to the CVR Energy Refinery.\r\nThe Facility produces and distributes chemicals, which are used in agricultural and industrial applications.  Production at the Facility consists of ammonium thiosulfate, ammonium bisulfite, and molten sulfur.  \r\nThese chemicals utilize several regulated and non-regulated substances as raw materials.  The products and raw materials require loading/unloading operations at the Facility, as well as the associated process and storage equipment.\r\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Tessenderlo Kerley identified no listed flammable substances and one toxic regulated substance kept on site above threshold quantities - anhydrous ammonia.\r\nThe Wynnewood Facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Wynnewood Facility.

Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\r\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \r\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised."

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and failure mode and effect or the deductive fault tree technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.

In addition, all operators are periodically to receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at acceptable level.  The appropriate frequency of training is to be based on management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.  All of this training is to be documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n Contractors\r\nThe Wynnewood Facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, there are procedures in place to ensure that contractors do as follows:\r\n perform their work in a safe manner;  \r\n have appropriate knowledge and skills;\r\n are aware of the hazards of their workplace;\r\n understand what they should do in the event of an emergency;\r\n understand and follow site specific safety rules; and\r\n inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\r\n\r\nThis is to be accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers the following:\r\n a process overview; \r\n information about safety and health hazards including known or potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards;\r\n emergency response plan requirements; and\r\n safe work practices must be developed and implemented regarding control of entrance, presence and exit of contract personnel prior to beginning their work. \r\nIn addition, contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor are to be evaluated. Contract employee injury and illness log should be maintained.  Plant personnel are to periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\nA PSSR should be conducted on any new facility or facility modification that requires a c"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and highly hazardous chemicals into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\r\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and adequate.  A PSSR verifies that a PHA was conducted, recommendations resolved, and training of employees involved in the process has been completed prior to start-up.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nWell established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment should be maintained.  The basic aspects of this program are to include:\r\n training; \r\n developing written procedures; \r\n performing inspections and tests consistent with good engineering practices; \r\n  correcting equipment deficiencies outside acceptable PSI limits; and, \r\n applying quality assurance measures.  \r\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on \r\n an overview of the process; \r\n safety and health hazards;\r\n applicable maintenance procedures;\r\n emergency response plans; and\r\n applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\r\nAnother integral part of mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Quality assurance measures are to be incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.

Checks and inspections are to be performed to assure that installation is consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions suitable for the particular application.  The Facility has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include the following:  \r\n control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel;\r\n a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;\r\n a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before process piping and equipment is opened;\r\n a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and \r\n a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  \r\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThere is a comprehensive system of written procedures to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, impact to safety and health and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Prior to changes being made, they are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition operating and maintenance personnel, including contractors employees, are provided any necessary training on the change."

The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Wynnewood Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\nThe Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP covered process:\r\nRelease Detection\r\n1. Hydrogen Sulfide, sulfur dioxide and ammonia sensors with audible alarms.\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n1. Key manual valves are chained and padlocked in their critical (open/closed) position.\r\n2. Excess flow check valves designed to plug the outlet if outflow reaches equivalent of 90 lbs/min.\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n1. Standard operating procedures that control, isolate, and terminate leaks.\r\n2. Personnel trained in emergency procedures.\r\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., escape respirator, self-contained breathing apparatus, and supplied air breathing apparatus).\r\n4. Ventilate contaminated areas.\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no incidents involving a release of anhydrous ammonia that caused offsite impacts.\r\nEmergency Procedure Information\r\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.
