This includes compliance with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan, along with other safety and environmental programs already in place, enables JTM to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of ammonia, including leaks, spills, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\r\n\r\nJTM's emergency response program is designed to provide rapid response to suspected problems to keep hazardous materials from being released into the environment, minimize the effects of any spills and provide proper clean-up and required notifications as soon as possible following any incidents.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Chemical Description\r\n\r\nJTM is a food processing facility located at 200 Sales Drive, Harrison, Ohio.  The facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (112(r)) of the Clean Air Act, due to one on-site process containing a regulated chemical above its threshold quantities.  Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in the facility refrigeration system in a quantity greater than the 10,000 pound threshold as established in the regulations.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is present as the refrigerant in the plant refrigeration system.  Preparation of the food products, packaging, and storage operations require refrigeration to keep raw ingredients and products fresh.  The system consists of compressors, evaporators, piping and associated equipment located at various strategic locations throughout the plant.  The ammonia may exist as either a gas or a liquid in different parts of the system.  \r\n\r\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nJTM complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program rules for ammonia.
