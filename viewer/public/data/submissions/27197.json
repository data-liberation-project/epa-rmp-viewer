This summary describes Chemical Montana Company?s Risk Management Program for its Helena, Montana facility.\n\n\nI.  Statement of Commitment to Safety\n\nChemical Montana Company?s President drafted a formal ?Statement of Corporate Policy on Safety and Environmental Protection.?  This statement has been provided to all employees and the Company?s public and private emergency responders as evidence of the Company?s commitment to safety.  The following excerpt is taken directly from the Corporate Statement:\n\n    The personal safety and health of each member of Chemical Montana Company staff is of     paramount importance.  As a company, our very existence depends on service to our customers     and support from our neighbors.  Chemical Montana Company?s reputation for safety in handling     chemical products will do much to determine the company?s future growth.  Our goals include     employee safety and prevention of all hazardous material releases to the environment.  We will     maintain a safety and environmental program which embodies the proper attitudes toward safety     and environmental protection on the part of everyone. This program requires the total cooperation     on the part of every employee in all safety, health and environmental matters.\n\nChemical Montana Company has specifically authorized designated facility emergency coordinators to ?commit any resources necessary to control an incident.  This includes mobilization of other emergency response organizations as well as the purchase of necessary supplies and equipment.?\n\nII.  General Facility Description\n\nChemical Montana Company is located in a residential area near inside Helena city limits.  The site is bounded to the North by Burlington Northern Railroad, to the East by Interstate - 15 and to the South and West by residential properties.  There are no at-risk populations (e.g., schools, nursing homes,"

Description of Primary Activities at Facility\n\nChemical Montana Company is primarily a warehousing and distribution facility. Very little packaging (e.g. transferring materials from a large container to a smaller container) occurs at this facility.  No manufacturing occurs at this facility.  All RMP Process chemical products are received, stored and delivered to customers in closed containers.\n\nB.  Description of Facility Processes\n\nChemical Montana Company engages in the following activities:\n\n    Delivery by truck of chemical products in bulk and nonbulk UN-approved containers\n\n    Internal movement of chemical products from the receiving area by forklift (or pallet jack) to and     from the designated storage area\n\n    Delivery of chemical products to customers\n\n    Very minimal repackaging from large container to small container as mentioned above\n\nC.  Description of Products/Quantities handled at Facility\n\nChemical Montana Company may store one CAA 112RMP program chemical in amounts that exceed threshold quantities.  That chemical is Chlorine gas.  The largest container of chlorine gas that might be stored at the facility is a 150lb cylinder.\n\nIII.  Worst Case Release Scenarios/Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThis section summarizes the worst-case scenarios and the alternative release scenarios presented in the facility?s RMP plan.  As defined by the CAA, the worst-case scenario describes the consequences of a release of the entire contents of the largest single container with the largest distance to a toxic endpoint within 10 minutes.  The alternative release scenario describes the consequences of a release of 150 pounds of chlorine from the container, within a half-an-hour with active mitigation being considered.\n\nA.  Worst Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worse-case scenario for Chemical Montana Company is a release of a 150 pou"

      "SummaryText": "nd cylinder of chlorine gas.  A release of this magnitude would impact receptors within a 0.4 mile radius (as determined by RMP*Comp).  The Company believe that this release scenario is extremely unlikely given the inherent integrity of containers used for chlorine.  Chlorine cylinders are manufactured to meet stringent U.S. Department of Transportation standards.  These container standards are specifically designed to minimize (if not eliminate) the possibility of accidental release during the rigors of transportation in commerce.  These containers are only to be moved at the facility in single units (I.e., one at a time).  This factor, by itself, eliminates the possibility of a release (during onsite movement) of a quantity greater than one cylinder.  Cylinder valves are by a steel housing to prevent accidental damage during handling/transportation.\n\nChemical Montana Company stores chlorine containers outdoors under a canopy to provide protection from weather/temperature.  The storage area is not located in an area subject to traffic.\n\nB.  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario at Chemical Montana Company includes the accidental release of a 150 pound cylinder of Chlorine gas with active mitigation.\n\nRelease of Chlorine:  Because of the inherent integrity of the cylinder itself, only the valve and fusible plug present feasible release scenarios.  As explained above, the valve is protected by a steel housing on top of the cylinder and damage could only occur if a force strong enough to remove the housing occurs.  The fusible plug is designed to melt at approximately 157*F.  If the fusible plug melts as a result of fire, it is expected that the chlorine would be entirely consumed by the fire.  The facility has the appropriate chlorine kits for containing releases from chlorine cylinders.  These kits are designed to seal leaks at the valve or fusible plug.  The radius of the area affected by the alternative release scenario is approximately 0"

Therefore, only the street immediately in front of the facility and the neighboring properties across the street could be affected by a release under the alternative scenario.\n\nIV.  Accidental Release Prevention Planning at the Facility\n\nA.  Rules and Regulation that Apply to this Facility\n\nToo many federal, state, and local environmental safety rules and regulation apply to this facility to detail in this summary.  The primary legislation affecting chlorine is OSHA?s Process Safety Management rule. A chlorine PSM program has been implemented at the facility.  The uniform fire and building codes also apply to this facility and are enforced by the Helena Fire Department.  The fire department performs regular safety inspections of the facility.\n\nThe Company has a formal safety training program designed to meet training requirements promulgated by OSHA, DOT and EPA.  Hazard communication training (OSHA) is the primary method the Company uses to educate employees on the risks associated with these chemicals.  Emergency response training is performed in accordance with OSHA?s HAZWOPER regulations (29 CFR Part 1910.120).\n\nV.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have never been any accidents or accidental  releases involving either of these chemicals at Chemical Montana Company.\n\nVI.  Emergency Response Program\n\nChemical Montana Company has an emergency response plan that is reviewed and updated as often as necessary (e.g., to reflect changes in personnel, emergency response contractors, etc.).  The facility has contracted with an emergency response contractor to provide assistance with any incidents that cannot be handled by the facility or the fire department.\n\nVII.  Planned Improvements to Safety Program\n\nChemical Montana Company is committed to accident prevention and, accordingly, maintains an excellent reputation in the chemical distribution industry.  The primary planned improvement to Chemical Montana Company?s safety program is an update of the training m"
