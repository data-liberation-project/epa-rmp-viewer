The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the City of Cedar City \r\n\r\nRegional Wastewater Treatment Facility has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario \r\n\r\nrepresents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the City of Cedar \r\n\r\nCity Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this \r\n\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an \r\n\r\naccidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the \r\n\r\neffects would be less.\r\n\r\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating \r\n\r\nchlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\r\n\r\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a ves"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as \r\n\r\nwell as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of \r\n\r\nrecommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the RMP Manager and is tracked through \r\n\r\ncompletion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the City of Cedar City Regional Wastewater \r\n\r\nTreatment Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency \r\n\r\nuntil the Chlorination Process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the RMP Manager for \r\n\r\nconsideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n4.3  Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nCity of Cedar City Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related \r\n\r\nto the Chlorination Process operation should be safely performed.
