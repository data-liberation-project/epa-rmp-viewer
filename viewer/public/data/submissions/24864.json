Manager 712-722-2671\n\n1.\n\nThe Owners, management, and employees of Farmers Coop Society of Little Rock are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale directly to farmers.\n\n3. Worst and Alternate Case Scenario\n\nThe Worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas for 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,530 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacit as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .79 miles.\n\nThe alternate release is the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .56 miles.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program \n\nThe Farmers Coop Society has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n4. Five year accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Farmers Coop Society has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state "
