Shell Chemical LP is a signatory to Responsible Carea, an American Chemistry Council program committed to the continuous improvement of chemical safety management.  In accordance with Responsible Carea, the Norco Chemical Plant maintains Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) management systems to ensure the safe operation of its facilities.  As part of this commitment, NCP invests resources in various areas of accident prevention such as:\n\n- Safety in process design\n- Safe operating policies and procedures\n- A comprehensive mechanical integrity program\n- Management of process changes\n- Training\n- Incident investigation and auditing\n- Emergency response.\n\nThis document provides an overview of the risk management activities at the Norco Chemical Plant - West Site, including:\n\n- A description of the facility and substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule.\n- A summary of potential release scenarios and potential off-site consequences.\n- An overview of the Accident Prevention Program to prevent accidental chemical releases.\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n- An overview of the emergency response program\n- Existing and planned improvements to prevent accidental chemical releases.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant - West Site operates two (2) units with regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered under the RMP rule.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  These two units, the M-unit and the C4 Volatiles Unit, store or process RMP flammable substances, as follows:\n\n1.  M-Unit \n\nProduces and/or stores intermediate feedstocks used in the production "

The mixtures are Butylene Feed (feedstock) and Butane Residual (byproduct).\n \n2.  C4 Volatiles \n\nStores feedstocks used in the M-Unit and byproduct from the M-Unit.  Byproduct from the M-Unit is sent to MOTIVA-Norco Refining Co. alkylation processes via pipeline.  The feedstock comes into this unit via pipeline from the East Site of Shell Norco Chemical Plant and via pipeline from barge or rail.  Feedstock may also be loaded onto barges or rail car and shipped off site.   RMP regulated substances include butane and 2-butene contained in two flammable (NFPA 4) mixtures, Butylene Feed and Butane Residual.\n\nThese units are reported in the RMP as one process due to the interconnected piping associated with the operations.  An incident at one of these units, or at the rail car and barge unloading/loading areas, could impact the rest of the facility.  Therefore, quantities reported in the RMP include the M-unit, the C4 Volatiles Unit and the shipping areas that service these units.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) SCENARIOS\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed on the potential worst-case scenario (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS) involving flammable substances at the Norco Chemical Plant - West Site.  The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions, nor allow credit for all mitigation measures in-place.  On the other hand, the ARS is a more realistic scenario, which takes into account actual operating conditions and applicable mitigation measures.\n\nThe following are brief summaries of the Worst Case and Alternate Release scenarios at the Norco Chemical Plant - West Site, including information on mitigation measures that reduce potential offsite impact.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) RMP*Comp Versio"

Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, BUREAU OF THE CENSUS LandViewa III Environmental Mapping Software (1997).\n\n1. Worst Case Scenario - Flammable Mixture\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a flammable release assumes the catastrophic failure, instantaneous release, and vapor cloud explosion of 7,000,000 lbs. of a flammable mixture (containing butane and 2-butene) in a storage sphere.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to structural and natural obstacles between the sphere and off-site receptors. No passive mitigation (i.e. containment) credit was applied to the release calculation. The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 1.5 miles (8,120 ft.). A population estimate of 721 people offsite, including residential, recreational, religious, school and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release. No environmental receptors were identified.\n\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for mechanical safety systems on worst-case scenarios, there are various controls that minimize the likelihood of the occurrence of the worst-case scenario. These include:\n\n- Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs \n- Audible and visual alarm systems\n- Deluge system\n- Routine surveillance by trained operators\n\n\n2.  Alternative Release Scenario - Flammable Mixture\n\nThe alternative release scenario for this facility assumes a ?\" leak in an elbow in the 14 inch line to the feed pumps between sphere V6006E and the first isolation valve.  A release of Butylene Feed would occur and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  Although the mixture is liquefied under pressure in this line, modeling was conducted based on a gas release because it produced a longer distance to endpoint and was a more conservative approach.

Other PSI documents include, but are not limited to process drawings, descriptions of safe operating parameters and limits, chemical inventories, basis for process design, safeguarding, protective instrument and equipment construction information. Many of the documents, including MSDS' are electronically available to all NCP employees and contractors. The Process Safety Management policy also includes a summary table to assist employees in locating process safety information documents and drawings.\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHAs)\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant maintains a comprehensive Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) program to identify and control hazards associated with its processes. These include processes covered under one or a combination of: (1) RMP Program Level 3, (2) OSHA PSM, and (3) Shell internal criteria. NCP uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology to conduct process unit PHAs. PHA team members must include experienced employees with operating, maintenance, and engineering backgrounds who are familiar with the affected process. The PHA team is chartered to identify the safety hazards in the process, evaluate the adequacy of existing safeguards in-place, determine the risk of the event occurring, and recommend additional accident prevention mitigations when the team believes such measures are necessary to reduce event risk.

PHA mitigations are tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved. Process unit PHA's are revalidated every 5 years for the life of the process. Written PHA reports are also retained for the life of the process.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nNorco Chemical Plant operating departments maintain written procedures to address a variety of operating modes such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide a reference to experienced operators, as well as serve as a training tool for new operators. Each PSM covered operating department must annually certify their procedures as current and accurate. The management of change process is also used to ensure operating procedures are updated as necessary to reflect changes in the process unit. Operating procedures are accessible to all NCP employees either electronically or in hard copy.\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant implements a comprehensive training program for all operating, maintenance, and technical personnel. New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their process. In addition to classroom training, on-the-job training is accomplished by working with experienced operating personnel. Along with routine operating practices, the training places a significant emphasis on unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions (including shutdown).

The training program complements the written operating procedures to ensure operating employees are properly qualified for their job. Training is documented and managed by the NCP Training Department and by designated department training focal points.\n\nContractors \n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant routinely uses contractors to supplement its maintenance and technical workforce, particularly during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Since contractors may work on or near process equipment, NCP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors have the proper knowledge, skills, and training to perform their work in a safe manner prior to working on-site. Contractor safety programs and performance are primary factors influencing the Contractor selection process. Contractors are both routinely monitored by a Contract Coordinator and periodically monitored by a consulting auditor  to ensure compliance with regulatory and Shell requirements.  Contractor safety performance is also part of NCP weekly safety statistics communications to employees and contractors. \n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features such as P&ID and other process drawings, operating and/or maintenance procedures, training and equipment are up to date and appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in-service.

The basic aspects of the mechanical integrity program include (1) training for process maintenance activities, (2) ongoing inspection and testing of process equipment, (3) correction of identified equipment deficiencies as appropriate, and (4) quality assurance in construction, installation and spare parts. Maintenance personnel are trained on the safety and health hazards in their work areas, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner. Inspections and tests are performed to ensure that the process equipment functions as intended and that the equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. acceptable wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, the operating department must correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service. The appropriate mechanical integrity support group (i.e. Inspection and Pressure Equipment, Mechanical, Electrical, or Instrumentation) review equipment use and determine any necessary actions to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\nSafe Work Practices and Permitting\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples include: (1) the control of entry and exit of support personnel in a process area, (2) equipment lockout and tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening process piping or equipment, (4) a permit process to control hot work, and (5) a policy and permit process to ensure "

These safe work practices, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to its processes. This system requires that changes to equipment hardware, chemicals, operating variables (including critical process operating conditions), procedures, operating staff and any other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, all personnel affected by a change must be provided the necessary notification and training. \n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant promptly investigates incidents resulting in, or those that could have reasonably resulted in fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to NCP Management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all potentially affected employees and contractors. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed "
