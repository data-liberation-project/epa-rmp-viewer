All applicable procedures from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The NEPA emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans detailed specifically to the NEPA located in North East, Pennsylvania and to the emergency response services available in the community as detailed in the NEPA Off-Site plan submitted and approved by the Erie County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe NEPA facility, located in North East, Pennsylvania is an Absorption Refrigeration Plant (ARP).  The facility conditions anhydrous ammonia for use as a refigerant by the adjoining Welch, Foods, Inc. operating facility.   Ammonia is not manufactured or produced by the plant.  The anhydrous ammonia system contains bulk tanks, process piping, various safety and monitoring systems, and various chillers.  Operators are on staff to respond to any alarms and maintain the system.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two releases for this chemical, the \"worst case release scenario\" and an \"alternate case release scenario.\"  The worst case scenario is defined by the RMP regulation and states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the?maximum quantity in the largest vessel?is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternate case scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\"\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\n\nThe general accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is as follows:\n\n?

Preventative maintenance programs to maintain a good mechanical integrity of the system.\n? The Management of Change program identifies potential concerns before system changes are implemented.\n? Detailed inspection program to identify potential concerns before they become a problem.  The inspection program includes low level leak detection activities.\n? A compliance audit program that meets the criteria of OSHA's PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119).\n? Chemical specific prevention steps for anhydrous ammonia include Level B and Level C personal protection equipment to be used for emergency response and certain other activities; training of emergency responders and maintenance employees on the toxic and physical properties of ammonia; the chemical sensing system and other safety systems.\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) meeting the criteria of OSHA's PSM standard 29 CFR 1910.119 was conducted for the anhydrous ammonia system.  A combination of the What-if and FMEA methods was used to analyze the anhydrous ammonia system.  A team consisting of safety and environmental professionals and plant engineers analyzed the ammonia system.  In regards to the mechanical integrity portion of PSM, the standard ANSI K-61.1 was used to evaluate the safety and integrity of the system.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no anhydrous ammonia \"accidents\" within the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nNEPA has a comprehensive emergency response plan, including an Off-Site plan that has been approved by the Erie County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  NEPA has contracted on-site emergency responders trained at the 24-hour technician level (OSHA HAZWOPER standard), as well as the Incident Commander level.

The emergency response team is well equipped with chemical sensing equipment; personal protective equipment; offensive and defensive strategy tools & equipment; radio communication; pre-determined response checklists for Incident Command, first aid responders, EMT's and medical supplies.  All NEPA on-site contracted emergency response teams (fire, chemical and other emergency situations) use the Incident Command System.  This system includes provisions for interaction and support of off-site professional emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTo improve safety at NEPA a search for more reliable ammonia sensors that require less maintenance is being conducted. There is also a review/discussion of the OSHA PSM program at the safety meetings which are conducted on a monthly basis to assist in improving safety."
