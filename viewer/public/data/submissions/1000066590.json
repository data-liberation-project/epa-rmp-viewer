      "SummaryText": "The Nevada, Ohio location of AgGrow, LLC is a facility whose primary activity is the storage, sales and distribution of anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) to end user farm operations. The management and employees are trained in the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, facility personnel are trained to respond to and stop the release and minimize the offsite consequences.  If the release is too large for personnel at the store to manage, the facility is prepared to work with the Wyandot County Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate large releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \r\n \r\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage process consists of two storage tanks and various mechanical components to facility safe handling and delivery of the product.  The process is used to receive anhydrous ammonia from the delivery truck (typically tankers) into the storage tank and distributed from the storage tank into farmer owned nurse tanks.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at the Nevada facility is 280,000 pounds.  \r\n \r\nBoth a worst-case and alternative release scenarios were performed for the anhydrous ammonia storage process.  The hazard assessments were performed on the anhydrous ammonia process using RMP Comp.\r\n \r\nThis facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The prevention program ensures that our facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce the potential of an accidental release due to human error, or equipment failure at our facility.  In order to prevent the release of anhydrous ammonia due to human error, our prevention program ensures that operating procedures are current and reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part in our program.  Employees and others wo"

Our facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, ANSI K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  \r\n\r\nAt the time of the submittal of this Risk Management Plan, there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from our facility in the past five years. \r\n \r\nHowever, in the event that there is an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, an Emergency Action Plan has been written in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38 to assist employees in responding to the release. We have also provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information required under SARA Title III (EPCRA) and have been included in the Local Emergency Planning Committee hazard assessment and emergency response plan.  Our emergency action plan consists of evacuation procedures for various spill scenarios, facility emergency numbers, and notification procedures for Wyandot County Fire and Rescue and the public. \r\n \r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
