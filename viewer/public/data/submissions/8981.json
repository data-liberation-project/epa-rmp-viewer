The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon\n      dioxide formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n      Our ficility stores and uses quantities of toluene diisocyanate in excess of the threshold quantities\n      specified in the 40 CFR 68.115.\n     \n      The TDI is stored as follows:\n\n      Three 6,300  gallon TDI storage tanks (see Section 1.3 for worst-case release)\n\n      TDI is pumped from the storage tanks to the production line where it is mixed with other chemicals and\n      reacts to form polyurethane foam.\n\n1.3  Description of worst-case release\n\n       The worst-case release analyzed was the loss of the entire contents of a 6,300 gallon TDI tank  into\n        3,720 sq. ft. (120 ft. x 34 ft.) diked containment area.  It also assumes a maximum ambient temperature\n        (record 5 year high) of 105 degrees fahrenheit and a TDI temperature in the storage tank of 100\n        degrees fahrenheit.  It also assumes ''ground roughness\" to be \"urban or forest\".  The print-out shows\n        the distance to end point to be 28 yards.  Also all storage tanks are inside the building.\n\n1.4  Description of general prevention program\n\n        None required by this program.\n    \n        The action taken at our facility to prevent accidental release includes the following:\n        \n        Periodic inspection of all lines, pumps,.  Valves for leaks.  corrosion.  Operational failure.\n\n       Manual inspection of tank levels prior to loading to ensure adequate space is available.\n\n        Unloading operations are not left unattened.\n\n        Dual lined hoases for transport of TDI.\n\n        Storage tanks are indoors to reduce corrosion and protect from accidental rupture.\n\n         Storage tanks are all diked with concrete .\n\n1.5    Descr"
