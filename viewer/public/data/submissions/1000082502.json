Hydrogen and methane, in the amounts handled by our facility, is\n\nconsidered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and\n\nregulations. Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant. Our emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the Marathon Fire Brigade and other appropriate local responders so that appropriate measures can be taken to control accidental releases. In addition the facility has contracted  Industrial Emergency Services (IES) as an Emergency Response Company. This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen. Our refinery customer uses the hydrogen. Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as feedstock. The feedstock is reacted in the reformer furnace. By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,600 degrees F.) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are"

The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release\n\nPrevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4. Five year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of a flammable mixture that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard. At this site,\n\nemployees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies. They have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level. The employees will receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan. Emergency response activities will be coordinated with Marathon's Fire Brigade.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures.\n\n"
