The U.S. Venture corporate core values championed by our owners, embraced by our Senior Leadership, encouraged by our managers and pledged to our employees are: a) Caring Relationships, b) Entrepreneurial Spirit, c) Strategic Foresight, and d) High Performance. These four core values support our Safety and Health philosophy and management efforts. Interpersonal communications, problem solving, planning and safety achievement have a direct relationship with the core values when applied to safety training, hazard assessment/investigation, post-accident/incident recovery and generating solutions to potential risk exposures. U.S. Venture, Inc. integrates Safety Expectations as a part of Managers' responsibilities to create a meaningful daily presence during all work activity. All departments at the corporate level including Safety, People Resources, Finance, Engineering and Operations reinforce strategic safety planning and solid operation level decision-making that will reduce risk exposures. \n\nNacelle Solutions (Operator) recognizes that the personal safety and health of each employee of Nacelle Solutions is of primary importance. Prevention of occupationally induced injuries and illnesses is of such consequence that it will be given precedence over operating productivity, whenever necessary. To the greatest degree possible, management will provide all mechanical and physical measures and activities required for personal safety and health. We will maintain an occupational safety and health program conforming to the best practices of organizations of this type. To be successful, such a program must embody proper attitudes towards injury and illness prevention on the part of supervisors and employees. It also requires cooperation in all safety"

Only through such a cooperative effort, can a safety and health program, in the best interest of all, be established and preserved. Our objective is a safety and health program that will reduce the number of injuries and illnesses to an absolute minimum, not merely in keeping with, but surpassing, the best experience of operations like ours. Our goal is zero accidents and injuries. \n\nThe Freedom RNG (Renewable Natural Gas) Facility is located on a dairy farm in rural Kaukauna, Wisconsin. The facility is a biogas processing facility that also provides a decanting station.  The decant station provides capacity for the offloading of compressed natural gas into an injection point on the Wisconsin Electric Corporation Energy Group owned natural gas pipeline. At the decant site there can be a maximum of four trailers of processed methane with a capacity to hold 21,000-pounds of methane per trailer.  The trailers are transported to the facility from other biogas processing facilities throughout the state to inject their processed gas into the WEC pipeline. The quantity of methane that is stored onsite can exceed the 10,000-pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to The RMP rule. The facility is generally manned, with one to two Nacelle/U.S. Energy technicians for a period of 4-8 hours per day Monday through Friday.. \n\nThe Freedom RNG Facility's regulated methane process complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 52 for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Storage and Handling, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes including, Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services (WI DSPS), OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), and DOT's Hazardous Materials regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Vandebroek-Kaukauna Fire Department"

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Vandenbroek Kaukauna Fire Department and Outagamie County Emergency Management Planning Committee.  \n\n When an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged, CMD gas control operations will be notified through an automated service and a representative will call the on-call U.S. Energy personnel in response to confirm whether there is an actual emergency. If there is no answer from the on-call personnel to confirm whether help is needed, CMD will contact the Nacelle Solutions Operations Manager, and CMD gas control will continue calling personnel listed in the Emergency Response Program until they are able to speak with somebody in person to communicate the situation. \n\nOur continuous improvement process, inclusive of historic analytics, risk assessments, and corrective/preventive actions, focuses on three primary objectives: 1) The safety of clients, servicers, and community, 2) Up time performance and user experience and, 3) Factors influencing site costs and cost reductions achieved through root cause analysis and the implementation of long-term corrective and preventive measures.
