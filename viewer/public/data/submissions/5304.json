      "SummaryText": "Canyon Regional Water Authority is located in Guadalupe County, Texas, in a rural, primarily residential and recreational area.  Canyon Regional Water Authority is located near the City of New Braunfels, Texas.  The water treatment plant is located along the banks of the Guadalupe River, and uses chlorine gas as the primary water disinfectant.\n\nThe entire supply of chlorine on-hand is 2, one-ton cylinders, one of which is active in the process and the other is used as a back-up or replacement cylinder.  A vacuum activated system prevents leaks in the system.  A chlorine leak detector is in place with an audible alarm system to alert personnel of chlorine leaks.  There are 3 SCBA units on-site for chlorine emergencies.  The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times a day by an on-site operator and monitored daily on weekends.  Preventative maintenance is performed regularly and manifold piping is replaced annually, regardless of the condition.\n\nThe plant is under the jurisdiction of the Guadalupe County Volunteer Fire Department, coordination with this agency and other local authorities is being established to plan for a chlorine emergency.\n\nAn emergency action plan is being prepared, which will be maintained onsite at the Canyon Regional Water Authority office near the plant.  The plan includes:\n1.  Identification of an incident commander, operations and safety coordinator, and information coordinator.\n2.  Compliation of incident checklists and emergency notification lists in a central location.\n3.  Compliation of all MSDS in a central location.\n4.  Mapping of the immediate area with identification of residents which might be potentially affected."
