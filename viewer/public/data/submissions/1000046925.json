The facility processes and stores seafood using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nNorth Pacific Seafoods - RSC implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of certain chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many built-in safety features including high-level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutdowns, and leak detectors.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nThe facility mai"

The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during an emergency.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, and orderly evacuation of the facility. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nSafety at the facility will be improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process; safety meetings; employee suggestions; accident, incident and near-miss investigations; and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades are planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order.\n\n\n\n"
