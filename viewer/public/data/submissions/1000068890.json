The plan includes notification of the local fire department. \r\n\r\n2.\tStationary source and regulated substances handled\r\nThis facility handles two chemicals above the RMP threshold limits: Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide. They are both stored in 150 lb. and ton sized cylinders. Neither chemical is packaged or used at this facility. \r\n\r\n3.\tAccidental release prevention program\r\nA third party general duty audit was recently performed at the facility and corrective actions are in the process of being closed.  With the addition of chlorine and sulfur dioxide a Process Hazard Analysis was conduct and those corrective actions are also in the process of being closed.  The facility checks all of the cylinders that cross their docks for tampering and damage as per their standard operating procedure. A separate Harcros facility is the sole provider of Chlorine to all Harcros facilities. That site performs all of the required hydrostatic testing and changes out the valves each time the cylinders are filled. The sulfur dioxide is purchased from a vendor that adheres to the guidelines set forth by the Chlorine Institute. \r\nAccess to the storage area is limited to Harcros employees and contractors/visitors that both have a need to be in the area and have had a background check meeting the requirements set forth by DHS. \r\n\r\n4.\t5-year accident history\r\nNo RMP process related accidents have occurred at this facility within the last five years\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\r\nThe facility's emergency response is outlined in their Emergency Action plan w"
