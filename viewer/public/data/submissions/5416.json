In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream is located at 3426 Wells Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana.  We manufacture some of the finest ice cream in the world.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.  Also located at the facility is raw milk processing equipment, shipping and receiving docks, and a waste water treatment equalization tank.  The facility produces and ships approximately 240 million pounds of finished product each year.\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains in excess of 69,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern indiv"

The amount of ammonia that can continue to be expelled is the liquid that can gravity drain from the Evaporative Condensers to the Thermosyphon Vessels to the High Pressure Receiver.  The calculated amount of this release is approximately 6,300 lbs.\n\nThe Receiver is located in the production engine room, which provides a mitigating effect by slowing the migration of the released ammonia to the atmosphere.  EPA's RMP*COMP  calculated a release rate of 347 lbs. per minute and a release duration of ten minutes.  The Atmospheric Stability Class is F and the wind speed is 1.5 meters per second.  The topography around the facility is urban.\n\nRMP*COMP  calculated a toxic radius of 0.70 miles.  Using LandView III  it was determined that approximately 3,600 people live within this radius.  Also it was determined by the map generated using LandView III  that the following public receptors are within the radius: a school, residences, a youth correction facility, recreation areas, offices, and a zoo. The use of passive mitigation devices include: enclosures, drains and sumps.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SC"

EPA's RMP*COMP  also calculated a release rate of 93.1 lbs. per minute and a release duration of 12 minutes.  The Atmospheric Stability Class is D and the wind speed is 3.0 meters per second.  The topography around the facility is urban.\n\nRMP*COMP  calculated a toxic radius of 0.10 miles.  Using LandView III  it was determined that approximately 49 people live within this radius.  Also it was determined by the map generated using LandView III  that the following public receptors are within the radius: residences and offices. The use of active mitigation devices include: Emergency shutdown systems.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream has had one accident in the past five years involving ammonia.\n\nThe accident occurred on the morning of June 23, 1997 at approximately 0900 hours.  An employee mistakenly loosened the seat assembly on a thermal expansion valve instead of the dust cap.  As a result the internal apparatus of the valve fell out and high pressure liquid ammonia was released into the space.  This release was estimated to continue for ten minutes with a total release of 2,500 lbs. and was reported to the EPA.\n\nInjuries include the individual that loosened the seat assembly and two other maintenance operators that responded to help.  All three victims received minor injuries and were treated at a local hospital and released.  There were no deaths.  The estimated damage included loss of finished product valued a $5,000,000.\n\nAn investigation resulted in the following conclusions.  The cause of the incident was human error while performing a maintenance activity.  As a result there has been additional training of employees and changes in maintenance procedures to prevent a reoccurrence of this particular incident.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event t"

      "SummaryText": "hat an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify the onsite Engineer and Emergency Response Facilitator.  The facilitator takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device.  If the facilitator determines that the ammonia level is above 25 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\n\nThe engineer determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed.  If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted.  Also Edy's Grand Ice Cream Emergency Response Team is contacted.  The engineers then take appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\n\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Edy's Grand Ice Cream to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system. \n\nAmong the improvements slated for completion in 1999 is an extensive operator training program, policy updates, additional emergency responder training, the addition of more safety equipment, cross training of maintenance and utility personnel, modifications to the ammonia detection system, and a complete Mechanical Integrity Inspection."
