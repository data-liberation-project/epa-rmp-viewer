      "SummaryText": "The Belleville Wastewater Treatment Facility at 450 Environmental Drive, Belleville IL. 62220, is located just east of the St. Clair county Fairgrounds.  Our plant is designed to treat 8 million gallons of daily average flow.  We treat combined wastewater with primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment.  It is within this tertiary treatment process that we use a federally regulated chemical, chlorine, for pathogen disinfection.  We are permitted for and use chlorine only during storm water flows (not dry weather flows).  Our chlorine is contained in 2000 and 150 pound cylinders.  We use one 2000 pound cylinder at a time with another cylinder on standby. This system is controlled by an automatic change over valving system.  The building is equiped with automatic shut off valves for one ton cylinders, also a chlorine detector and has visual and audible alarms that will trip with the detection of as little as one part chlorine per million.\n\nManagement and staff at the Wastewater Plant take the storage and use of chlorine very seriously.  Management has developed and implemented proper procedures for the safe handling and use of chlorine in our process, including an Emergency Action Plan for disasters and chlorine leaks should one ever happen.  \n\nA worse case scenario for our plant would be the accidental release of 2000 pounds of chlorine in a  gaseous state within a ten minute period.  Using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Table or Equations model, the chlorine release could affect approximately 13,100 people within a 1.3 mile radius surrounding the release point.   However, with our process contained inside a building, aveage prevailing winds blowing in an unpopulated direction and our chlorine emergency response program, would make this scenario very unlikely.  \n\nAn alternative scenario would be the result of a connection or valve leak during the changing of a tank in the process.  The release duration would be less than one minute and the rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease of less than a pound of chlorine.  There would be no offsite consequence because the end point for toxicity, the distance a toxic vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to a point that serious injuries from short term exposures will no longer occur, would not reach offsite.  The release would be contained inside the process building.  Plant personnel are trained and the equipment is available to repair this type of leak. We have had no accidents of this sort in the past five years.      \nThe WWTP accidental release prevention program is regulated by the State of Illinois Process Safety Management.  At the time of installlation or construction, we have complied with NFPA58, OSHA, ATM, ANSI and ASME design codes and safety standards.  Safety information is readily available to all plant personnel.  Plant management has taken steps to prevent chlorine releases.  These steps include:  written response plans, proper safety and repair equipement, training sessions, operating procedures and early warning systems.  We have developed an emergency response program specifically for the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The program includes procedures and contact for earthquake, flood, tornado, fire and explosions, accidents requiring emergency medical treatment and toxic releases (chlorine).  Management has also started a program for hazard review and preventative maintenance.  All employees are aware of and trained in these procedures for the protection of themselves and the public.  \n\nThe Belleville Wastewater Division has added a staff position to, among other duties , more closely monitor and administer safety and prevention programs.  We are working with the Illinois Department of Labor Safety Inspection and Education Division for more training."
