Our program provides the essential planning and training for more effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have an on-site emergency response team.  Team members are trained and properly equipped to respond to a variety of emergency situations, including fires and chemical releases.  We also coordinate emergency response with the local police/fire departments, Local Emergency Planning Commissions (LEPC), and other county emergency responders.  Our emergency response training includes drills, which are conducted annually with all the emergency responders.\n\n7.0  \tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nWe have many upcoming events and projects planned for 2006 and 2007.  Nalco Company at Sugar Land will set into motion multiple projects to improve safety at the facility.  Some of the projects were suggestions or hazards recognized by employees, such as a major project to either repair or rebuild multiple roads within the facility to reduce the hazards associated with forklift traffic.   \n\nOther projects include improving fall protection at our 2nd Street truck loading area and railcar loading area.  Nalco is also looking at ways to reduce the summer heat in Bldg. 35, as well as ways to improve our forklift inspection program.  Within the production areas a project to recondition or relocate safety showers/eye washes is planned."

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented for the handling and use of substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule, including the following:\n\n\u00b7 \tA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule,\n\u00b7 \tOur accidental release prevention and emergency response policies,\n\u00b7 \tA synopsis of our off-site consequence analysis reporting,\n\u00b7 \tOur general accidental release prevention program and specific release prevention steps for the RMP regulated substances,\n\u00b7 \tA five-year history of accidents associated with the RMP regulated substances, and \n\u00b7 \tOur emergency response program.\n\n2.0  \tStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\nThe Sugar Land Plant produces numerous chemical products using a variety of raw materials and processing operations.  From these different raw materials and operations, the plant annually produces more than 100 million pounds of specialty chemicals for our customers.  Approximately 185 employees work year round at our facility to meet the needs of oilfield producers, refiners, and chemical plants.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that the EPA has regulated as either toxic or flammable substances under the RMP rule, in quantities in excess of the applicable threshold amount:\n\n\u00b7 \tToxics\n   o \tVinyl Acetate\n   o \tEpichlorohydrin\n   o \tEthylenediamine\n   o \tCyclohexylamine\n\u00b7 \tFlammables\n   o \tTrimethylamine\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the pote"

It is worth noting that the RMP definition of a potential worst-case scenario results in an event that is far beyond any reasonable expectation.  The alternative release scenarios represent more credible events; however, they are not as likely to occur with our mitigation measures implemented.  Nalco\u00bfs RMP does include both worst-case and alternative case scenarios for the toxic and flammable chemicals. \n\n4.0  \tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nWe maintain a number or programs to help prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals and to ensure safe operations.\n\nThe accident prevention programs in place include the following:\n\u00b7 \tProcess Safety Information: We have a program in place to ensure that information is available regarding the hazards of the regulated chemicals, the processes that handle these chemicals, and the equipment in the process.  This information is used to identify and understand hazards posed by these chemicals and processes.\n\u00b7 \tProcess Hazard Analysis: Under our procedure from process hazard analysis, we perform detailed hazard analyses to identify hazards, to assess the likelihood of those hazards (including accidental releases), and to evaluate the consequences of these hazards.  Analyses are performs on both new and existing processes.  Hazard analyses for regulated chemical storage include a review of material unloading, storage, and transfer operations.\n\u00b7 \tOperating Procedures: We have developed written procedures for the operation of all our processes.  These procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved with each covered process."

We also have written procedures for safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening of process piping (line-opening), and control over the entrance into the plant by support personnel.\n\u00b7 \tTraining: Every employee involved in operating a covered process is trained in the written operating procedures.  The training includes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operating procedures, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\n\u00b7 \tMechanical Integrity: We have an extensive mechanical integrity programs with written procedures to help ensure that our process equipment is inspected and maintained.  Employees with mechanical integrity responsibilities are trained to ensure that they can perform their job tasks safely.\n\u00b7 \tManagement of Change: We have a written management of change program to ensure that changes to a covered process are adequately reviewed before they are implemented.\n\u00b7 \tPre-Startup Safety Review: Similar to management of change, we have written procedure for the review of new or significantly modifies equipment, before that equipment is started up.  The review is conducted to confirm that the equipment is properly designed and installed and that the associated procedures are in place and are adequate.\n\u00b7 \tIncident Investigation:  When an incident or near-miss occurs, we have a written procedure for reporting incidents and investigating them appropriately.  The purpose of these investigations is to determine the cause of the incident or near-miss and to identify corrective actions, which can help prevent a recurrence of that event.\n\u00b7 \tHot Work Permit: We have a written procedure and permit for hot work, conducted on or near a covered process, operations.  The procedure and permit are intended to ensure that the hot work is adequately reviewed prior to starting and"
