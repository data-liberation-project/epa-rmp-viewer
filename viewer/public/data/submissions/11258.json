Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Specified Fuels & Chemicals are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Specified Fuels & Chemicals is a Responsible Care. company and a member of the Texas Clean Industries 2000.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nSpecified Fuels & Chemicals, L.L.P. (SFC) operates as both a petroleum refinery and a specialty chemical tolling facility.  As a refinery, SFC produces research and reference fuels to the automobile and engine oil manufacturing industries.  As a chemical manufacturer, SFC produces high volumes of specialty chemicals requiring multiple processing steps.  Since 1990, SFC has been a commercial scale toll and custom chemical producer with emphasis on the manufacture of esters and acetates used in water-based paints, adhesives, paper coatings, textile finishing and safety glass.  The quantities listed below represent the maximum amount of a regulated substance that could be onsite.\n\nChemical                                                                              CAS No.                            Maximum Inventory (lbs)\nToxic Substances:\nVinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester]             108-05-4                                      7,500,000\n\nFlammable Substances (Liquid Form):\nPropane                                                                                 74-98-6                          "

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nSFC is the owner and operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  SFC is a Program 3 level facility because the processes covered under RMP are also subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Substance Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances, as a class, involves a catastrophic release of Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester].  The scenario involves the instantaneous release of 7,500,000 lbs. of Vinyl acetate monomer in a liquid form over 10 minutes and is completely contained within a diked area."

      "SummaryText": "  Evaporation from that pool within the dike occurs over a 60-minute period.  Calculations take into account the worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) in an urban setting, and are calculated to a toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Vinyl acetate monomer involves a release from a ruptured disk or a relief valve failure.  The scenario involves the release of 5,770 lbs. of Vinyl acetate monomer. It is assumed that the release takes place for 60 minutes before it is brought under control.  The toxic liquid is contained in a pool, from which surface evaporation takes place over the 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include automatic shut off valves, booms, foam and sorbent to confine the release.  These active mitigation controls are expected to limit the extent of the spill and reduce the amount released by over 99%.  Under the most common weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/l of Vinyl acetate monomer is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nFlammable Substance Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario for flammable substances, as a class, involves a catastrophic release of Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl].  The scenario involves the release of 39,000 lbs. of Isopentane.  It is assumed that this quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with the entire released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) in an urban setting, the endpoint is calculated to be 1-psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances involves a release of Isopentane from a valve failure at the bottom of a tank. The scenario involves a 60-minute release of 17,000 lbs. of Isopentane that is completely contained within a diked area.  It is assume"

Under the most common weather conditions the endpoint of 5 kilowatts/square meter (flash burns), which is the distance at which the radiant heat effects could cause second degree burns from a 40-second exposure, is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSFC has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The petroleum refinery and specialty chemical tolling processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  SFC is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSFC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The checklist method is used to carry out our process hazard analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis or when there is a change in the process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, SFC maintains written standard operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency "

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nSFC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  New employees receive training and are tested for competency before starting work.  Refresher training is provided on a regular basis.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nSFC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure valves, storage tanks, hoses and piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices and are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at SFC to manage changes in chemicals being manufactured, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at SFC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nSFC will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits will be carried out at least every 3 year"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nSFC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.  There is a Safety, Health & Environmental committee at the site, which is made up of hourly employees as well as management employees.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of the contractor safety performance is carried out.  SFC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\nSFC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\nSFC has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuat"
