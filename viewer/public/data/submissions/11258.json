Calculations take into account the worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) in an urban setting, and are calculated to a toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Vinyl acetate monomer involves a release from a ruptured disk or a relief valve failure.  The scenario involves the release of 5,770 lbs. of Vinyl acetate monomer. It is assumed that the release takes place for 60 minutes before it is brought under control.  The toxic liquid is contained in a pool, from which surface evaporation takes place over the 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include automatic shut off valves, booms, foam and sorbent to confine the release.  These active mitigation controls are expected to limit the extent of the spill and reduce the amount released by over 99%.  Under the most common weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/l of Vinyl acetate monomer is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nFlammable Substance Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario for flammable substances, as a class, involves a catastrophic release of Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl].  The scenario involves the release of 39,000 lbs. of Isopentane.  It is assumed that this quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with the entire released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) in an urban setting, the endpoint is calculated to be 1-psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances involves a release of Isopentane from a valve failure at the bottom of a tank. The scenario involves a 60-minute release of 17,000 lbs. of Isopentane that is completely contained within a diked area.  It is assume"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSFC has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The petroleum refinery and specialty chemical tolling processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  SFC is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSFC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The checklist method is used to carry out our process hazard analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis or when there is a change in the process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, SFC maintains written standard operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency"

SFC is a Program 3 level facility because the processes covered under RMP are also subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Substance Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances, as a class, involves a catastrophic release of Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester].  The scenario involves the instantaneous release of 7,500,000 lbs. of Vinyl acetate monomer in a liquid form over 10 minutes and is completely contained within a diked area."
