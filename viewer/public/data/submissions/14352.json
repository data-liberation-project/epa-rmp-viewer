      "SummaryText": "Aluminum Casting and Engineering Co, is an aluminum production and processing company located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  As an adjunct to the processing of aluminum propane is used as a heating fuel.  Two vessels with a capacity of roughly 30,000 gallons are maintained on site.  Each tank is maintained at an 85% fill level.  All 450 employees are made aware of the propane on site and given Hazard Communication training relative to the OSHA Standard.  Employees that work with the system have all been given specific training including operational and safety training.  this training is updated as the system changes and/or on a refresher basis.  This training is augmented by the Emergency Response Program as it pertains to all employees.  The community is also informed with the fire, hospital, police, LEPC and other necessary agencies written into the Emergency Response Plan.  Propane has neither been an on or off site problem as there is no report of an accident within the last five year reporting period.  The program will continue to operate without incident as all aspects of the appropriate NFPA, ANSI, OSHA, EPA, and local governmental requirements are met.  Under the Clean Air Act, Risk Management Plan requires that a worst case and alternate case catastrophic release scenario's be developed, they include the following:  WORST CASE:  Total propane released 119,235 pounds, at a rate of 13,100 pounds per minute, over a ten minute period, under atmsopehric conditons dictated by the EPA.  The maximum threat zone for LOC is 1.0 mile.  ALTERNATE CASE:  Total propane released 108,901 pounds, at a rate of 9,980 pouns per minute, over a twenty-nine minute period, the atmospheric conditions are the same as the Worst Case, the maximum threat zone for LOC is 1,387 yards."
