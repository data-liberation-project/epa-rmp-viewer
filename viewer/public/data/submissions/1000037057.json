The Facility complies with OSHAs 29 CFR 1910.106 requirements for flammable liquids, and it is the Facility's policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is Facility's policy to notify the applicable outside agencies thatmight be called upon for assistance(i.e: police department, fire department, etc.).The Facility has determined that Program Level 1 applies to this facility. Per 40 CFR 68.10, Program 1 applies if all the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n-->No five year accident history\n\n-->Distance to toxic or flammable end point is less than the distance to any public receptor; and\n\n-->Emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the stationary source and local emergency planning and response organizations.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is a new site and has had no accidents. The distance to flammable end point is 0.6 miles and there is no public receptor in this distance. The emergency response procedures have been coordinated with the local emergency plannig and response organization.\n\n\n\nA description of the Facility and the regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nThe Facility stores three-60,000 gallon natural gas liquid tanks (500,220 pounds natural gas liquid per tank)and one-4,000 gallon natural gas natural gas liquid surge tank (33,348 pounds natural gas liquid in the tank). The total storage capacity for natural gas liquid is 1,534,008 pounds of natural gas liquids.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nThe Facility complies with EPAs chemical accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations. The worst-case release scenario (WCRS) evaluated was the rupture of one 60,000 gallon storage tank. WCRS has potential of the formation of a vapor cloud that could explode when expos"

Using the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Risk Management Plan (RMP) Data, the WCRS distance was calculated to be 0.6 miles from the process. The population of 0 was estimated to be in the WCRS. No public/environmental receptors were identified in the WCRS. The Facility utilizes a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspects the facility. Other safeguards at the Facility include high pressure/overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nAn accidental release of natural gas liquid resulting in death, injuries, significant property damage, sheltering in place, or causing environmental damage on-site or off-site has not occurred within the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program\n\n\n\nThe Facility has a written Emergency Response Program that includes include specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of natural gas liquid, procedures for informing the public and local agencies responding to accidental releases, and information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nNone identified at this time."
