In line with its Environmental, Safety, and Health (ESH) Policy, TI is committed to maintaining a safe workplace and minimizing environmental impact through the responsible handling of hazardous chemicals. TI\u0092s Risk Management Program includes hazard assessments, accidental prevention measures, and emergency response plans, aimed at reducing risks to public health and the environment. This proactive approach reflects TI\u0092s ongoing commitment to safety, regulatory compliance and continuous improvement.\n\nTexas Instruments is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, specializing in the production of analog, embedded processing and signal processing technologies. TI chips are ubiquitous in a wide range of industries including automotive, industrial, aerospace, communication and personal computing to name just a few. TI chips are manufactured in 200mm and 300mm wafer factories that use various chemical processes to pattern, etch, deposit, and dope microscopic electronic structures. Texas Instruments \u0096 LFAB, located in Lehi Utah, is one of TI\u0092s advanced 300mm fabs producing next generation electronics.\n\nSituated at the heart of Silicon Slopes, LFAB is bounded by Lehi City, Highland City and the southern slope of Traverse Mountain. At full capacity, LFAB will produce 10s of millions of chips daily in its 620 sqft of clean room space. This level of production can only be achieved through storage, distribution and use of hazardous chemicals in large quantities; in some cases, exceeding EPA RMP quantity thresholds and posing a risk to surrounding communities in the case of a catastrophic failure. At this time, chemicals of concern include:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, CAS Number 7664-41-7: The anhydrous ammonia distribution system consists of one 12,000 gallon storage tank, two redundant 30-kilowatt va"

As such, TI manages the anhydrous ammonia system as a program level 3.\n\nTI is committed to preventing accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. This system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with all applicable regulations. TI employees and contractors having duties related to the bulk systems are thoroughly trained on applicable tasks and procedures. Additionally, TI maintains a written emergency response program and has trained emergency responders on-site to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. \n\nThe prevention program focuses on hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training, and maintenance activities and formalizes these practices into our ESH management system. \n\nHazard Analysis: A formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted to assess the upset conditions the equipment may present, the controls in place, and the adequacies of these controls to prevent events with high or catastrophic potential. The type of PHA used to analysis the anhydrous ammonia is system was a Hazard and Operability Study. \n\nProcess Controls: Numerous process controls and safeguards have been included in the design and operation of the equipment associated with the chemical processes covered by the PSM/RMP Rule including: \n\u0095\tFenced manufacturing site with controlled access\n\u0095\tControlled and limited access to the bulk chemical storage area\n\u0095\tClosed circuit camera monitoring of the bulk chemical storage area\n\u0095\tMultiple ambient toxic gas monitoring devices for ammonia\n\u0095\tAutomatic or manually activated Water fog / sprayer system for ammoni"
