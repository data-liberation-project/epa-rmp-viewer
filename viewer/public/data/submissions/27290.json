      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nBackground\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant is owned and operated by the City of Belle Glade and serves a total population of 14,906 people.  The plant is rated at 6.5 MGD and uses an activated sludge process.  As part of the process, chlorine gas is used as a disinfectant against pathogens in the treated water. The Clean Air Act 112(r), lists chlorine as a regulated toxic substance. Facilities that store amounts of regulated substance greater than their respective threshold listed in Table 1 of 40 Code of Federal Regulations(CFR) part 68.130, must comply with the provisions of 40 CFR part 68, the Risk Management Program (RMP).  The Wastewater Treatment Plant has a maximum inventory of 8.000 pounds of chlorine which surpasses the 2,500 pound threshold for chlorine.  For this reason, the Wastewater Treatment Plant must meet the terms set forth in the RMP.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nAs part of the RMP, an offsite consquence analysis (OCA) was conducted to determine the potential area effected by a  worst case and alternate release case scenario, and disclose the offsit public and environmental receptors affected by these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario was modeled using RMP's Comp Ver. 1.07 and considered a one ton chlorine cylinder releasing its full contents in ten minutes.  This accident could result from a cylinder wall failure or puncture.  It was determined that this scenario would have an impact on offsite public receptors located within a 1.3 mile radius from the Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considers a 1/4 square inch hole due to a fusable plug leak,  Using RMP Comp Ver. 1.07 the release rate for a 1/4 inch hole is 47.4 lbs/min. It was determined that this scenario would have an inpact on offsite public receptors located within 0.1 mile radius from the Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nNo environmental receptors were identified for either scenario.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn a effort to discourage scenarios similar to t"

      "SummaryText": "he ones listed above from occuring, the Wastewater Treatment Plant has up-to-date technological equipment, is implementing standardized procedural practices, and is incorporating chlorine training and awareness programs.\n\nThe plant used vacuum regulators to reduce risks or breaks associated with pressure systems.  A chlorine gas detector is used as a warning device to detect chlorine leaks.  The system is interfaced with central control panel located in the control room.  The facility is staffed 16 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\nPlant procedural practices are safety oriented and include procedures for operating, inspecting. Changing, and maintaining chlorine process equipment.  A training program is provided to familiarize City employees with the chlorine process and safety equipment.  Other programs are implemented to ensure information on chlorine and its hazards are available to the plant employees and contractors.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe WWTP has no reportable accidental releases within the lasr 5-years.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe City of Belle Glade Utilities will not be responding directly to non-incidental releases of chlorine gas.  The local emergency responder for the City of Belle Glade's Wastewater Treatment Plant will be the City Of Belle Glade's Fire Department."
