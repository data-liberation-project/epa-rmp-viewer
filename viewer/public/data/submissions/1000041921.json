      "SummaryText": "Schwans places a high priority on chemical safety.  The Director of Environmental Health and Safety is assigned responsibility for ammonia refrigeration safety.  All facilities with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule maintain 3-shift coverage of refrigeration technicians who have 24-hour technician level emergency responders training with an 8-hour refresher course.\n\n\n\nThis facility manufactures frozen convenience foods.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia, with a system inventory of approximately 68,000 pounds.  A Management of Change is implemented if new refriegeration equipment is added and the ammonia inventory significantly increases.  \n\n\n\nWorst and alternate release scenarios are calculated using RMP*comp and urban conditions.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is covered by OSHA PSM rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe last Management of Change will be conducted in 2018 due to replacement of piping with different material and schedule based off of recent NDT report from Acuren as well as a personnel change for the director of manufacturing, EHS director, EPA director, and regional manager for this site."
