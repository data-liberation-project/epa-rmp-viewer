We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe City of Blackwell/Designee believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases. Operation and Maintenance Manuals (O&M's) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n\n\nThe City of Blackwell/Designee has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, maintenance crews, and fire department to be first responders to a release.\n\n\n\nThe Water Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection of the water.

The location of the facility is 220 W. Lawrence, Blackwell, Oklahoma in Kay County. This summary was prepared to comply with the Risk Management Plans requirements under the Clean Air Act (r).  The facility contains or has the potential to contain 4000 lbs or more chlorine. The volume of chlorine on site is normally 4000 lbs.  \n\n\n\nThis plan includes maps of the area with corresponding maps indicating the possible hazard zone under the Worst Case Scenario and an Alternative Release Scenario as required by the Clean Air Act RMP requirements in section (r) for program 3 facilities.  These maps delineate the areas that are considered hazard zones under each scenario and the area that will need to either be evacuated or have the residents or occupants sheltered in place.\n\n\n\nBlackwell takes many precautions to prevent releases of chlorine gases that could affect either their employees, nearby business and the public.  The precautions include on site alarm systems to warn employees of a release, an enclosed storage location to assist in containing the leak, a ventilation system to protect workers and, when appropriate, disperse the chlorine gas in a safe manner over a period of time.  The most probable type of releases may occur when there is a transfer hose or washer failure in the chlorine lines. Blackwell has trained a number of workers who know how to use emergency equipment, self-contained breathing apparatus and other personal protective equipment to repair such leaks. Blackwell keeps a  chlorine kit on site and has trained its employees to perform repairs on small leaks.   This is to be done in conjunction with the Bl"
