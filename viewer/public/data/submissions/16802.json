              "Description": "The ammonia prevention program takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\nProcess safety information\nProcess hazard analysis\nOperating procedures\nTraining\nMechanical integrity\nManagement of change\nPre-startup safety review\nCompliance audit\nIncident investigation\nEmployee participation\nHot work permit\nContractors\nThe ammonia vessel was designed and build per ASME code for pressure vessel. It is inspected every 5 year externally and every 10 year internally. The vessel is protected by two pressure relief valves to prevent over pressure, the valves are serviced and calibrated annually. Equipment maintenance are performed only by qualify craftsmen.\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.",

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces Rare-Earth compounds, Aliphatic Polyisocyanates paint additives, and Agricultural Intermediates using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The Freeport plant is located in the Brazosport area, about 50 miles south of Houston, right on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The plant sits on 200 acres, of which 50 are developed.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\n Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in the Rare-Earth process as one of the raw material stored in a 10,000 gallons storage vessel. It is then fed to the aqueous ammonia converter prior to its application as a neutralizing reage"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\nAmmonia is routinely received in tank-truck quantity, transfered into the 10,000 gallon storage vessel. The WCS is based on the release of the maximum possible content of the storage vessel in 10 minutes. The ERPG-2  toxic end-point distance is 2.6 miles as calculated using EPA's RMP-Comp version 1.06.  In this case, if and when it occurs, such release will have an off-site consequences. The storage vessel was designed and built per ASME code for pressure vessel with Maximum Allowable Working Pressure of 300 psig. Typical storage pressure during summer months is 140 psig. Under our mechanical integrity program the vessel is inspected every 5 years externally, every 10 years internally.  There are 2 pressure relief valves protecting the vessel, each one is serviced and calibrated on annual basis. Routine maintenance are performed as soon as any deficiencies are found.   \n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\nThe ARS selected to illustrate a more likely case that can occur and has the potential to reach public receptor is the failure of the 2-inch transfer hose. The ERPG-2 toxic end-point distance is 0.5 mile as calculated using the EPA's RMP-Comp version 1.06. Our standard operating procedure requires both our operator and the delivery truck driver to be physically present to immediately stop the transfer should an"

Both the tank-truck and our vessel are equipped with access flow valve that will stop the release automatically. Routine maintenance are performed on piping, valves, pump and instruments as soon as repairs are needed.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND AMMONIA-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup safety review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nAs stated earlier, the ammonia vessel was built per ASME code and inspected each 5 years externally and 10 years internally. The 2 pressure relief valves that prevent over pressure, standard operating procedure and the trained operator who monitor each transfer operation. Equipment maintenance are performed only by trained and qualify craftsmen.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical re"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\nWe will improve the training program for personnel involved with the anhydrous ammonia system and conduct refresher training at least once every 3 years. Update the standard operating procedure to un-load ammonia and start-up procedure after an emergency shut-down. Institute periodic hose inspection & replacement program and better equipment and line labeling for clarity. Relocate tubing out of harms way to prevent accidental damage.  We will develop a plan for the water curtain system to specify when and who has the authority to activate the system. We believe these improvement together with all the other measures currently in place will help prevent accidental releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment."
