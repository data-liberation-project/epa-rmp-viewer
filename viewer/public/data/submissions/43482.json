Howard, Biola, CA, 93606 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged fertilizers to our customers.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received and stored for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in one above ground tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 12,000 gallons or approximately 62,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\n\tAnhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and alternative Release Scenario\r\n\tThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 12,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.10 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or most likely potential incident) is a release from a 1.5-inch line.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .48 miles.\r\n\r\n4.\tAccidental release Prevention Program\r\n\r\n\tAnhydrous Ammonia: The facility has implemented the provisions of the \u00bfSafety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, p"
