Universal Pure's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Maintenance and Refrigeration Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nUniversal Pure is located at 8 Lee Boulevard, in Malvern, Pennsylvania. The facility is located to the south of the Pennsylvania Interstate 76 and approximately 1 mile north of US Highway 202. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of light commercial, industrial, and residential areas.  The facility was acquired by Universal Pasteurization (now Universal Pure) in 2015, and began operations in June 2015.  \r\n\r\nThe primary business of Universal Pure is to provide cooling and storage of food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage, dock operations, and HPP processing.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Universal Pure ammonia"

For example, the facility also operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \r\n\r\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors in the cold rooms and vent line.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that relieve into a common header that vents to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the International Mechanical Code, Universal Pure has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following: \r\n\r\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. \r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following: \r\n\r\n\u00bf \tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or \r\n\u00bf \tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\" \r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable releases in this facility's five year accident history since Universal Pure became the owner of the facility and began operations in 2015. \r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Universal Pasteurization facility has an emergency ac"
