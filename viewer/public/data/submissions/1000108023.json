Maverick is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors, visitors, and the surrounding community and the environment. This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as, training, design safety, operation, and maintenance of the facility. \n\nII.\tFACILITY DETAILS AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HELD\nThe Dry Trail Gas Processing Plant (Dry Trail Plant) is located in Texas County, Oklahoma, 12 miles north of Guymon, Oklahoma on Highway 136, 10 miles west on County Road 7. Dry Trail Plant recovers Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from the natural gas stream and utilizes the liquid CO2 by injection for secondary oil recovery. In the process of extracting CO2 and returning it to a liquid state, natural gas liquids are also recovered. The NGLs are then processed into high ends and low ends, which separates the NGLs and condensate. The natural gas liquids and condensate are regulated flammable mixtures (comprised of methane, ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes). There are no threshold quantities of 112(r) regulated toxic substances at the facility. \n\nIII.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at the Dry Trail Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continue safe operation. The Dry Trail Plant has safety features in many areas to quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. Maverick has programs in place to address accidental release prevent"

All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\nThe facility utilizes the What If process hazard analysis methodology. The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: toxic release, fire, explosion, over-pressurization, corrosion, and equipment. The facility utilizes process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, scrubbers, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, and alarms and procedures to prevent or limit releases.\n\nMaverick keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\nMaverick maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations, including normal operations, manual operation, and emergency shutdown. The facility has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in facility operations.\n\nContractors\nThe contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employ"

The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\nMaverick conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and controls in a safe operating condition.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe facility's management of change (MOC) program reviews all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nMaverick has procedures to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance. The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases. Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe facility will conduct audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.

No incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the facility within the last five years. Since plant start up in 1996, there has not been a single release of any regulated substance.\n\nV.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe Dry Trail Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatments for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as necessary instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Dry Trail Plant facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Maverick understands that"
