Kayem Foods' products include hot dogs, traditional Italian sausages, deli meats, pizza and even fresh gourmet chicken sausage. Some of our well known brands include: Kayem Old Tyme Hot Dogs, Genoa Sausage, Triple M Spiral Hams and Al Fresco Pizza and Chicken Sausage.  Kayem Foods has been in operation at this facility for over 90 years providing quality Frankfurt and Deli Processed Meat products and over 500 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nKayem Foods is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  It is Kayem Foods' policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and, as applicable, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nKayem Foods is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing and distribution areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [Federal Department of Agriculture (FDA)] to ensure quality in the final products.  Kayem Foods also operates freezers and coolers for product storage.  Kayem Foods uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 200,000 sq-ft facility within the required range of operating temperatures and to operate the freezers and coolers.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard re"

Kayem Foods' refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping, and currently contains approximately 24,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Kayem Foods has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel over a 10-minute period.  Based on Kayem Foods' refrigeration system, the worst case release scenario is the rupture of the high pressure receiver containing 11,500 pounds of ammonia when filled to 85% capacity, the maximum fill capacity allowed by Kayem Foods' operating and engineering controls during pump down. Using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations, the maximum distance to the specified \"endpoint\" (a conservative distance established by EPA at which it is expected that a person could be exposed to the chemical for an hour without suffering irreversible health effects) includes schools, hospitals, churches, personal residences, and various commercial areas.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered by Kayem Foods to be a likely release scenario for the facility.  During normal operations, Kayem Foods maintains the receivers at no more than 50% capacity.  Only during pump down operations would the receiver have the potential to be filled to 85% of capacity.  The receiver may be operated in pump down mode but only when substantial system repairs are required.  To date, there has never been a need for a pump down situation.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Kayem Foods, Inc. taking into consideration the operating experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) c"

A more credible release scenario identified by Kayem Foods would be an outdoor release caused by a failure of a ?\" high pressure liquid pipe and a reasonable response time.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Kayem Foods has implemented several precautionary measures that include process/equipment controls, procedures, preventive-maintenance programs, employee training, and audit programs.   In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system itself is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems. \n\nKayem Foods has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system.\n\nKayem Foods has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed at least annually by means of SOP review session(s).

The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed by the maintenance department.\n\nTo ensure that Kayem Foods' control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RM Plan regulations, Kayem Foods conducts detailed compliance audits every three years.  Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n \nKayem Foods' insurance carrier conducts independent audits on an annual basis, and the USDA conducts daily inspections.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n \nOver the last five years, Kayem Foods has not experienced an accidental off-site release of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system.\n \n \nEmergency Response Program\n \nKayem Foods has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release.  This program is described in a document entitled KAYEM FOODS, INC. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.
