      "SummaryText": "The Henderson (Smackover) Unit Facility is a newly constructed facilty that will receive gas and condensate from area wells via flowline.  The sour gas and condensate is treated to remove water, and H2S, and CO2 from the inlet gas.  The gas is further processed through a cryogenic process involving the rapid temperature and pressure change via a Joule-Thompson (JT) valve which condenses the lighter hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane, to condense forming a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) product.  The NGL product is stored in to two pressurized bullet tanks with respective volumes of 42,000 and 11,675 gallons and operating pressure of ~200 psi.\n\nA total rupture of the 42,000 gallon NGL tank resulting from an explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Henderson (Smackover) Unit Facility.  Due to the proximity of the second NGL tank, and subsequent explosion of its 11,675 gallons of NGL is likely.  Therefore the release of 53,675 gallons of NGL has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.5 miles.  No public receptors are within a 0.5 mile radius of the NGL tanks.  Since the facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis.  Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a  Program 1 level RMP under 40 CFR 68.\n\nSince the facility is under construction, there is no accident history to report.  Should an emergency involving the Henderson (Smackover) Unit Facility NGL system occur, it is our policy to notify the Kemp Volunteer Fire Deparement and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department."
