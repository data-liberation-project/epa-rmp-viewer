      "SummaryText": "A. Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant\r\nThe Water Division is a branch of the City of St. Louis Department of Public Utilities.  We have proudly invested in and served the greater St. Louis Metropolitan area since 1835.  The Water Division's Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant has been providing safe, clean drinking water to city customers since 1929.  Additionally, the Howard Bend Plant also wholesales high quality water to a number of surrounding water utilities in the counties of St. Louis and St. Charles.  The plant is located off of Olive Boulevard in the Missouri River Valley in Chesterfield, Missouri.\r\n\r\nB. Chlorine\r\nAt the Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant, we have always used chlorine as a part of the treatment process that provides our community with safe drinking water.  Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant.  It has been safely used to disinfect drinking water for nearly 100 years.  Water supply disinfectant has virtually eliminated incidences of waterborn diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery and is credited with increasing American's life expectancies by more than 50 percent.\r\n\r\nChlorine is a greenish-yellow gas with a pungent, irritating odor similar to bleach and is toxic in certain concentrations.  Chlorine exists as a gas at ambient temperature and pressure, but is liquified when kept in our process equipment.  The chlorine we use is trucked into the plant in one ton cylinders and stored in a dedicated building protected by a scrubber-system.\r\n\r\nC. Environmental, Health and Safety Policy\r\nWe have long understood the hazards of handling chlorine, which, if not handled properly, can pose a risk to the community.  It is the Water Division's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and to promote a healthful, safe, and protected environment.  The chlorine process at the Howard Bend Plant is regulated by the U.S. EPA Risk Management (RMP) Rule.  The Howard Bend"

Risk Management Plan\r\nWe recognize there are risks associated with handling and using chlorine.  We have been, and will continue efforts to improve the safety of our plant.  The Water Division has conducted hazard reviews and has implemented an accidental release prevention program which integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Additionally, the Howard Bend Plant has trained employees for emergency response and maintains an Emergenency Response Plan which has been supplied to the St. Louis County Hazmat Team.  These programs enable the Howard Bend Plant to prevent the occurence, and minimize the consequences of hazardous releases of chlorine.\r\n\r\nE. Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\nUnder the RMP rule, the Howard Bend Water Plant is required to conduct and document an offsite consequence analysis, which includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA as the \"maximum quantity in the largest vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes\" during worst-case weather conditions (no wind, low humidity), due to an unspecified failure.  This worst-case scenario assumes that all safety systems fail and that there is no emergency respose.  The alternative release scenario is a different, more realistic scenario, which depicts a failure defined by the facility.  In the alternative release scenario, facilities are allowed to include active mitigation systems in calculating the distance that an accidental release of this type could pose as a hazard to the public or the environment.\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis is done by 1) determining the distance from the point of release that an accidental release could pose a hazard to the public or"

To determine the distance over which releases could pose a hazard to the public or the environment, the EPA has established endpoint exposure concentrations.  The endpoint for chlorine is based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Reponse Planning Guideline (ERPG)-2.  This value represents the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects of symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".  The chlorine toxic endpoint used in offsite consequence analysis is 3 parts per million (0.0087 milligrams/liter).  The population potentially effected is defined as the population within a circle that has as its center point of release, and its radius equals that distance to the endpoint. The offsite consequence analysis for the Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant was conducted using the latest version of EPA's RMP*Comp atmospheric modeling software.\r\n\r\nF. Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases.  Designed to reduce both the likelihood and severity of releases of chlorine, this program integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  This prevention program ensures that safe handling principles as well as ensuring proper operation, maintenance and control of hazards.  The Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n-High levels of operator training\r\n-Preventive maintenance program is in place to ensure mechanical integrity\r\n-Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the partcipation of the operators\r\n-Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures, including corrective ac"
