Still other programs such as the NACD's Responsible Distribution Process, and guidance implemented based on EPA's SARA Title III regulations along with BOCA Building and Fire Codes have aided the company in designing and operating a safe plant.  These programs and regulations in conjunction with company policy help to ensure that the possibility of a release of this magnitude would never occur at the facility.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nThe Brenntag Southwest St Gabriel branch has never experienced a release of any magnitude that caused the facility to implement evacuation measures. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has emergency plans, which are coordinated with local fire departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). For all products, the plans are based off of information from the manufacturers of these materials. The emergency response plans for all company facilities include procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors, the local fire authority, and federal, state, and local agencies.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn order to continue to improve upon its safety record, Brenntag Southwest requires all of its facilities to conduct incident investigations, safety compliance audits, continuous training of normal, and emergency procedures, and continuous community outreach actions which include: educating and training neighbors, customers, fire departments, and emergency response teams.  These policies coupled with improvements that have originated from internal programs such as the Employee Suggestion Program and from external sources such as industrial associations like the Chlorine Institute aids the company in its continuous effort to enhance the safe handling and storage of compressed liquefied gas and its other products."
