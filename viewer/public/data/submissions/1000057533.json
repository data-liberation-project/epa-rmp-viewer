The facility has three aboveground storage tanks (2- 12,000 gallons and 1- 6,000 gallon capacity) onsite containing pentane (C.A.S.# 109-66-0) which is used in the formulation of the packaging products. All three tanks are maintained inside a concrete dike with a capacity to hold approximately 34,000-gallons. \r\n\r\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nRAPAC is committed to providing a safe working environment. We will achieve this mission by promoting a culture in which employee safety is paramount in each and every endeavor. We will actively promote and maintain the following beliefs in everything we do:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety performance is critically important to the success of RAPAC. \r\n\u00bf\tConcern for employee safety will be evident and embedded into all phases of our work by design and through the business decisions that we make. \r\n\u00bf\tEach employee is empowered with responsibility for his or her personal safety and the safety of their fellow employees and stakeholders. \r\n\u00bf\tContinuous improvement is a way of life at RAPAC; we use feedback and experience to refine and build upon our culture to ensure continual forward progress. \r\n\u00bf\tSafety incidents are preventable; we will strive to ensure that our policies, practices, and decisions are proactive on all accounts.\r\n\u00bf\tManagement is responsible for ensuring employees have the knowledge, skills, and equipment necessary to protect themselves and others. \r\n\u00bf\tWe will not be satisfied to simply meet safety compliance standards. \r\n\u00bf\tEvery task must be performed with concern for the welfare of ourselves, fellow employees, our contractors, our visitors, and the community in which we operate. \r\n\r\nRoles and responsib"

The success of our program depends on all employees incorporating our culture into every part of our day-to-day business practice and decisions.\r\n\r\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nRAPAC has developed and compiled a comprehensive set of operating procedures to provide instruction in the safe operation of facility processes covered by this risk management plan.  Procedures provide a reliable and consistent reference for all phases of process operations. \r\n\r\nEach procedure contains procedure steps, operating parameters and limits, safety and health hazard information, safety control measures, and assignment of responsibility for performing the procedure.
