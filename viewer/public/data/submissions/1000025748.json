The general overall process involves the suspension of liquid vinyl chloride monomer in a continuous water phase. The sole function of the water diluent is to facilitate heat removal from the polymerization reaction. The reaction is initiated most commonly with organic peroxide soluble in the monomer phase. PVC slurry is centrifuged and then dried. The clean dry PVC is stored in silos, prior to being sold by railcar, tank truck, one ton bags, and 25 kg bags.\r\n\r\nVinyl Chloride Monomer\r\n\r\nEDC is formed by oxychlorination of ethylene.

CFB - circulating fluidized bed technology allows solid fuel to gain more time for combustion to achieve high efficiency. The overall output capacity is 300 Mega-Watts(MW) which is composed of two 150 MW generators., The main heating fuel is the petrochemical coke generated by refinery plants, which used to be treated as a waste and now used as a heating fuel source for power plants. The plant consist of eight major systems - 1)Water Treatment system, 2)Solid Fuel system, 3)Boiler and Turbine system, 4)Cooling Water System, 5)Electrical system, 6) SNCR, GSA and Waste Water System 7)Ash Handling System and the 8)DCS System. Chlorine is utilized for biocide in cooling water tower.  \r\n\r\nChlor-Alkali\r\n\r\nThe Chlor-Alkali process receives brine that is electrolytically separated into hydrogen, sodium hydroxide and chlorine. The chlorine is washed, dried and compressed. The end product is used in the production of 1, 2-dichloroethane process.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZARDS OF THE PROCESS\r\n\r\nThe hazards associated with the chemicals used in all the referenced COVERED PROCESSES requires the unit to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule (29 CFR 1910.119), NFPA 58 (Storage- and handling of liquefied petroleum gases), Spill Prevention Control & Countermeasure program, and other applicable Resource Conservation & Recovery Act rule (RCRA). The equipment installed in the units was designed based on either ASTM, ANSI, or ASME standards. Before starting the each unit, a process hazard analysis (PHA) as required by OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 was completed. The methodology used was the Hazards and Operability Study. Since the last PHA study, process parameters have been changed, and additional process controls, process detection systems and mitigation systems have been installed.\r\n\r\nDuring the study, the PHA Team evaluated major hazards like, toxic gas rel"

In case there was an incident, the Team also evaluated the mitigation systems like sprinkler and water deluge systems to either dilute or keep below the explosion point of a gas release; and dikes to insure that the release does not spread and contaminate the surrounding ground.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\n5-year accidental release history: January, 2006 through December, 2011 was selected for the five-year accidental release history. There were no release accidents from a covered process involving a regulated substance that met the reporting requirements per the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\nSUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS\r\n\r\nAdministration Department\r\n\r\nPlans, organizes, directs, and controls the activities of the administrative services to carry out the administrative support operations at the company.\r\n\r\nInventory Control: Total commitment to providing service by ensuring that proper material stock levels are maintained, all materials received meet specifications, and right materials"
