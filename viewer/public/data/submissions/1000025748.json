              "Description": "Olefins 1 - This program decription is typical for all processes.\n\n\n\nFormosa Plastics Industrial Park, located on F-M 1593 in Point Comfort, Texas, is operated by Formosa Plastics Corporation, Texas (FPC-TX). FPC-TX is a vertically integrated organization. It consists of 11 \"covered process\" operations. The facility is located in the city of Point Comfort, Calhoun County, Texas. The facility currently employs approximately full time 1,700 employees in addition 500 contractors.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared by the Corporate Process Safety Management Coordinator. Each operating unit has appointed one individual as the person responsible for implementation of the RMP in that Unit. The Environmental, Health and Safety Department, through the Emergency Response Coordinator, oversees, provides guidance, and audits the RMP activities of the operating units.\n\n\n\nCompliance with 29 CFR 1910.119: On May 26, 1992, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule went into effect. FPC-TX is covered under this rule. The PSM rule consists of fourteen (14) elements. The facility has developed and implemented the fourteen elements of this rule.\n\n\n\nEven though the facility is large the entire site utilizes the same Prevention program throughout the site.  The Olefins unit will be used as a representative unit and the prevention programs of that unit will be reflective of the entire site.    The hazards associated with the chemicals used in the process, requires the unit to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule (29 CFR 1910.119), N-FPA 58 (Storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gases), Spill Prevention Control & Countermeasure program, and other applicable Resource Conservation & Recovery Act rules (RCRA). The equipment installed in the unit was designed based on either ASTM, ANSI, or ASME standards. Before starting the unit, a process hazard analysis (PHA) as required by OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 was completed. The methodologies used were Hazard and Operability methods. Since the last PHA study, additional mitigation systems have been installed.\n\n\n\nDuring the study, the PSM Team evaluated major hazards like: toxic gas release; fire; explosion; runaway reaction; polymerization, over-pressurization and overfilling tanks, reactors, etc; contamination of the chemical; corrosion of pipes; equipment failure; loss of cooling, heating, electricity and instrument air; and natural disasters like floods, tornado and hurricanes.\n\n\n\nBased on the hazards, the Team insured that there were adequate process controls like: vents; relief valves and rupture disks to insure that holding vessels do not fail in case of overfilling or over-pressurization; check valves to insure that the chemicals do not flow back into equipment containing incompatible materials; flares in case of a gas release; manual/ automatic shutoffs and excess flow device to prevent unwanted discharges; alarms and procedures for the operator to take action in case of a process upset; interlocks to insure that the system shuts down in case of an emergency; emergency power supply for equipment to keep functioning until the system can been shut down during utility failure; quench system to cool down heat generating reactions; purge system to ensure that a gas release does not cause an explosion and process area detectors to warn the unit in advance of-the impending danger of a gas release.\n\n\n\nIn case there was an incident, the Team also evaluated the mitigation systems like: sprinkler, foam and water deluge systems to either dilute or keep below the explosion point of a gas release; dikes to ensure that the release does not spread and contaminate the surrounding ground; and neutralization system to ensure that the released chemical becomes non-hazardous to the environment.\n\n\n\nChanges for 2010 include chlorine for this process ",

FPC-TX is covered under this rule. The PSM rule consists of fourteen (14) elements. The facility has developed and implemented the fourteen elements of this rule.\n\n\n\nCOVERED PROCESS - BRIEF DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nOlefins 1 & 2\n\n\n\nCombined, Olefins 1 and Olefins 2 have twenty-two pyrolysis furnaces used to crack a range of feedstock consisting of propane (3), natural gas liquids (NGL) (2), naphtha (4), and an ethane/propane mixture (1). The resulting products are ethylene (7), propylene (8), a mixed C4 product (9), pyrolysis gasoline (10), and pyrolysis fuel oil (11). The furnaces are fired with fuel gas (5).

The dry polyethylene powder is transferred to the pelletizing section. The powder, mixed with additives and stabilizers, is then injected into the extruder.

The sole function of the water diluent is to facilitate heat removal from the polymerization reaction. The reaction is initiated most commonly with organic peroxide soluble in the monomer phase. PVC slurry is centrifuged and then dried. The clean dry PVC is stored in silos, prior to being sold by railcar, tank truck, one ton bags, and 25 kg bags.\n\n\n\nVinyl Chloride Monomer\n\n\n\nEDC is formed by oxychlorination of ethylene. Four oxychlorination trains are used to combine ethylene, hydrogen chloride, and oxygen to form ethylene dichloride. Purified EDC (10) is thermally cracked into VCM and HCl in the EDC Crackers. The VCM produced in the furnaces is purified, washed, dried, and sent to the Polyvinyl Chloride department for conversion to PVC. HCl (6) is also purified to meet the quality required as the raw material for the oxychlorination section. EDC is recycled back to the process. Chlorine is utilized for biocide in cooling water tower.  \n\n\n\nEthylene Glycol\n\n\n\nThe Ethylene Glycol plant produces monoethylene glycol, diethylene glyco, and triethylene glycol.

      "SummaryText": "e Air Separation Plant (ASP) is reacted with ethylene from the Olefins Plant to form ethylene oxide (EO). EO is produced in the Scientific Design licensed glycol reaction and scrubbing section utilizing Mitsubishi reactors. This safe process begins with only 10 percent EO in a hydrolysis process to produce EG. There is no storage of EO on the site. If the EG unit is not running, the EO unit is shut down. The glycol is distilled into MEG, DEG, and TEG products. All process vents, except for the carbon dioxide regeneration vent, are directed to a furnace. Flammable mixture of ethylene and ethane is used in the process. Methane is used as a carrier during reaction. Chlorine is utilized for biocide in cooling water tower.  \n\n\n\nSpecialty PVC\n\n\n\nSpecialty Poly-Vinyl Chloride or SPVC involves the co-polymerization of VCM (Vinyl Chloride Monomer) and VAM (Vinyl Acetate Monomer). The process produces a fine, white powder that has many end product applications including: flooring, carpet backing, automobile underbody coatings, anti-fog applications, medical gloves, furniture, road cones, and many more. The production of SPVC involves three separate processes: (1) Emulsion Process; (2) Suspension-blending resin process and (3) Suspension-copolymer process.
