The Water Treatment Plant has a maximum inventory of five two thousand pound chlorine cylinders, or 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThis facility was designed under the ANSI/NSF Standard 60 (Drinking Water Treatment Chemicals - Health Effects - National Sanitation Foundation). The facility has the chlorine contained in a chlorine room, which is closed off to the rest of the facility and to the outside. This air-tight room has numerous chlorine monitors located in it to detect a release. The system employs a halogen valve system with two e-stops for automatic shut-off in case of a leak. Visual checks are also conducted periodically. Additionally, a solution of ammonia hydroxide is used when changing cylinders to detect any chlorine leaks. \n\n\n\nFor a chlorine emergency, the employees of the facility are trained to notifiy the appropriate emergency responders. The facility employees receive training in operation of the chlorine system, chlorine safety, and for minor repairs of chlorine leaks. \n\n\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine within the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe Southwestern Pennsylvania Water Authority's Water Treatment Plant is included in a community Emergency Response Plan which is administered by the Greene County Department of Emergency Services."
