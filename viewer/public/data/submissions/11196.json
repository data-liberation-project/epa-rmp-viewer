The tank is located in a diked containment area \nwith a surface area of 985 sq. ft.

The release duration is assumed to \nbe 60-minutes because the concentration of ammonia \nin solution after 10-minutes of evaporation is not \nsignificantly lower than the initial concentration.  \n\nDistance to Endpoint  -    0.65 miles  (OCAG)\n\nThe alternative release involves a failure of the \nunloading line during product delivery resulting in a \nrelease of 4,450 pounds over a 10-minute period.  The \nliquid released from the line/hose break is not \ncontained.\n\nDistance to Endpoint  -    0.21 miles  (ALOHA)\n\n50% Formaldehyde\t\n\nAqueous formaldehyde is stored in a 15,000-gallon \nstorage tank.  The tank is located in a diked \ncontainment area with a surface area of 985 sq. ft.  \nTrucks unload the material through a 2-inch hose.  \nBoth the storage tank and truck are maintained at \napproximately 150* F.  \n\nWorst-case release is an instantaneous release of the \nmaximum inventory of the tank which forms a liquid \npool in the dike.  The release duration is assumed to \nbe 60-minutes because the concentration of \nformaldehyde in solution after 10-minutes of \nevaporation is not significantly lower than the initial \nconcentration.  \n\nDistance to Endpoint  -    0.40 miles  (OCAG)\n\nThe alternative release involves a failure of the \nunloading hose during product delivery resulting in a \nrelease of 4,450 pounds over a 10-minute period.

The Insulation Systems Business Unit \n(ISB), of which the Newark Insulation Plant is a key part, demonstrates \nthis pursuit of excellence by proactively managing its operations to reduce \nenvironmental impacts while improving the quality of its products and \nthe well-being of its employees and the community.  ISB Environmental \nhas implemented a programmatic approach to compliance with the EPA's \nRisk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  All of the business unitms \nmanufacturing facilities will address process safety and risk management \nissues for key materials utilized by the plants in manufacturing fiberglass \ninsulation products. The program will fulfill the general duty clause \nrequirement in the RMP rule. The following OSHA and EPA covered \nprocesses are specifically addressed in the RMP manual:\n\n One-15,000 gallon storage tank of formaldehyde solution (50%)\n\n One-15,000 gallon vertical storage tank and associated surge tank of \naqueous ammonia (29.5%) and mix tanks in the Binder Room\n\n Two-33,000 gallon horizontal steel storage tanks of liquid propane and \nassociated cylinder filling equipment\n\nFacilities, like Newark, with threshold quantities above the RMP triggers, \nhave utilized a management manual system to comply with the \nrequirements of RMP.  This submittal only characterizes the subject \nprocesses, listed above, that require a RMP submittal and certification by \nJune 21, 1999.\n\n2.0\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE \nPOLICIES\n\nOwens Corning is committed to developing and operating its \nmanufacturing facilities in a manner protective of the environment and \nhuman health.

The facility also uses propane as a form of \nmotorized vehicle fuel for the plant forklifts and service equipment.  \nBecause these are toxic and flammable chemicals, numerous controls have \nbeen implemented to prevent an accidental release of these chemicals.  In \nthe event of a release, the Newark facility has an emergency response \nprogram that will be implemented.  This program is made up of employee \nvolunteers that have been properly trained in certain elements of \nemergency response, as well as communication with the appropriate \nresponder organizations in the community.\n\n3.0\tDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED PROCESSES\n\nThe Newark plant, located at 400 Case Avenue in Newark, Ohio, is a \nmanufacturer of wool glass fiber and fiberglass insulation products.  Glass \nfiber manufacturing involves the high-temperature conversion of various \nmaterials into a homogeneous melt, followed by the fabrication of this \nmelt into glass fibers.  After the formation of the glass fibers, a \nthermosetting chemical binder solution is applied to the fibers.  The glass \nfibers and binder solution are then collected on a conveyor belt where \nthey are sent through a large curing oven and then through a cooling \nsection.  The result is a mat of fiberous insulation that is then cut into batts \nor rolls of the desired dimensions and then packaged.\n\nNewark Insulation plant has three covered processes which are subject to \nRMP.  The formaldehyde solution utilized in a process to manufacture \nbinder resin is a Program Level 3 process.  While both the aqueous \nammonia and liquid propane storage tank systems are classified as a \nProgram Level 2.  Both formaldehyde and ammonia are binder system \ningredients used to manufacture wool fiberglass insulation at the plant.  \nPropane is used solely as a motor vehicle fuel for plant forklifts and \nservice equipment"

The maximum fill volume of each \npropane tank is 80% for a capacity of 26,400 gallons.  \nAt 4.24 lb/gal, each tank maximum inventory is \n111,936 pounds.  The tanks operate at ambient \ntemperature and equilibrium pressure.\n\nWorst-case release is an instantaneous release of \nmaximum inventory and formation of a vapor cloud, \nwhich explodes.

The presence of an unloading pad containment dike for the \nammonia process was considered as a passive mitigation measure, which \nwould limit ammonia evaporation and thus reduce release rate.  \nAccidental releases are mitigated by an aggressive spill reporting program \nand operator training in spill response.\n\n6.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nHistoric incidents are typically small local spills during unloading \nactivities within containment of less than 600-gallons of formaldehyde and \n20-gallons of ammonia since 1994.
