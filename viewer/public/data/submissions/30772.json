The tank is in a locked and fenced area away from the flow of traffic.  Active prevention measures include inspection of the tank before the start and at the end of each season.  All required repairs are completed prior to further use.  Further inspections are done twice a year by the Department of Agriculture Weights and Measures.\n\nEmergency response policies are described below.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThis facility is located 0.7 miles South of the city of LaMonte, Missouri.  It is adjacent to an abandonded missile silo.  Therefore, in it previous use, there had to be a significant clear space around the location.  The facility has 1 - 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tank.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case release scenario for this facility envisions a catastropic failure of the tank, possibly preceded by failure of the safety relief valve.  Regulartory and procedural controls limit the amount of anhydous in the tank to 80%.  Using RMP*COMP, the toxic endpoint calculated to be 6.9 miles.  This wouldinclude the entire town of LaMonte and its immediate surronding area.  \n\nAlternative release scenarios could involve a broken or damaged hose, allowing product to be released.  The toxic endpoint is 1.6 miles.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe facility complies with 29CFR 1910.111 (anhydrous ammonia)\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidents releasing anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility is located outside of the city of LaMonte.  Employees will notify the fire department in the event of a major release.  The general manager and other designatedd employees are authorized to take actions to stop small releases by shutting valves, etc.  Othe"
