Headquartered in Salisbury, Md., the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 14 states. Twenty processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week. Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest U.S. grain companies. Perdue also manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, livestock feed ingredients and  premium pet food ingredients.\n\n Perdue Farms Concord Cooking Plant Facility # 9099 is a fresh product cooking operation located at 862 Harris Street in the city of Concord, N.C. Perdue Farms has only one regulated substance covered by 40 CFR part 68 and that is Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n(1)  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n       Perdue Farms has developed and implemented release response plan (SPCC) and Hazardous Chemical Release Control and Countermeasure Plan (PSM) as part of the overall chemical management program. The programs involve a wide-range of senior management personnel ( including Environmental Services  Director and Safety Director).  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings that involve many levels of personnel. The facility also maintains a process safety management program as part of the overall chemical safety program. Lastly, Perdue provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to staff as part of the emergency response team.\n\n(2)  Description of Facility and the Regulated Substance\n\n      Refrigeration (anhydrous ammonia)\n      Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) is used as the refrigerant for the cooling system.  The total quantity of ammonia used in this process is approximately 32,500 pounds distributed throughout various system components ( i.e. compressor, pressure vessels, condenser"

The majority of the refrigeration components are located in the mechanical room with the exception of the condensers that are located on the roof and piping located throughout the facility.\n\n(3)  Worst-Case Release Scenarios\n\n      Refrigeration (Ammonia)\n      The predicted worst-case scenario for this process would be the rupture of the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) which would release its entire contents in a 10 minute span. This  vessel has a storage capacity of 20545 lbs. , a 100% liquid filled. Using RMP*Comp tm Ver. 1.06, the distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm or .14 mg/l) is 1.7 miles or 8976 feet. This radius encompasses approximately  4259 people inclluding Hospitals, Schools, Residential and Business.\n\n(4)  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n     Refrigeration ( ammonia )\n     The predicted alternate scenario would be the release of ammonia through the common header discharge from the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) associated with the High Pressure Reciever (HPR). The release would be outside above the roof at a height of 45 feet. Using RMP* Comp tm Ver 1.06 the distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm) is 0.1 mile or 528 feet. Release time would be 5 minutes at 42.1 lbs/min or 210 lbs over the duration. There is a small industry located nearby, which could effect approximately 150 people.\n\n(5)  General Accident  Release Prevention Program\n\n      The Perdue Farms facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazsardous Chemicals Plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 . Perdue Farms also utilizses a preventative maintenance program for its system components. As a part of this program, maintenance personnel inspect the refrigeration system operaating papameters and monitoring system five times per shift with all observations logged on a checklist.\n\n(6)  Five-Year Accident History\n\n      According to Perdue's Environmental Service Manager, there have been no "

The facility has a trained HAZMAT Team that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire or other  emergency situation. The written Emeragency Response Plan contaains specific informaion regarding Emergency Response organizsation and procedures, as well as incident  notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness. In addition, Perdue evacuation at least once a year.\n\n\n   As part of its Risk Management Plan (RMP), Perdue Farms has developed a RMP Communications Plan. The goals of the plan are to (1) educate the public on the potential risks of regulated substances used by Perdue; (2) respond to any concerns that RMP disclosures may cause with honest, fact-based communications; and (3) be fully prepared to effectively respond to any accidental release scenario. Proactive materials about disclosure information, how the company is prepared to deal with an incident, and how the community should respond; and a process for announcing that an incident has occurred ( to be used as needed) are being prepared. In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civic groups, media, environmental  groups, emergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\n\n(8) Planned changes to improve safety\n\n    As part of Perdue's continual improvement philosophy, all Perdue facilities continue to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety."
