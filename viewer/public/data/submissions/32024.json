It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations with regard to storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of W/G Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur the facility is prepared to work with the Thayer Fire Department, Neosho County Sheriff's Department and the Neosho County Local Emergency Planning Committee to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to both people and environment.  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizers.  \n\nW/G Fertilizer has implemented the provisions of ANSI K-61 and OSHA 29CFR 1910.111.  OSHA, EPA, DOT and the Kansas Dept of Ag regularly inspect our facilities.  These inspections along with the safety culture and training our employees have been through have helped us achieve an outstanding safety record.  Our employees receive semi-annual on the job training and must be able to demonstrate safe operating procedures before being allowed to handle anhydrous ammonia.  Our employees also receive certified training from the Kansas Fertilizer and Chemical Association.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years in excess of the reportable quantity as established by the above listed agencies.\n\nW/G Fertilizer has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA and the EPA and we report our regulated materials to the Community Right to Know program, the responding Fire Department and the LEPC.  Our safety practices go beyond what the law requires, we do what is good for business and safe for the community and the environment."
