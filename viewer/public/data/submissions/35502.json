(R&M)\u00bfs Sunoco Chemicals Haverhill Plant hereafter referred to as the Haverhill Plant located in Haverhill, Ohio.  The RMP program at the Haverhill Plant is in compliance with all requirements of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  This document provides a brief overview of the following elements of the RMP:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled;\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\nThe five-year accident history;\nThe emergency response program; and\nThe planned changes to improve safety.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nSunoco is committed to operating and maintaining all processes at the Haverhill Plant in a safe and responsible manner.  Sunoco continuously trains Haverhill Plant employees in facility operating procedures and performs ongoing preventative maintenance on process equipment.  The Haverhill Plant uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the hazards associated with the regulated chemicals used on site.  By maintaining these programs, the Haverhill Plant ensures the safety of plant personnel as well the safety of the public and the protection of the environment.     \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nThe Haverhill Plant produces a variety of specialty chemicals utilizing seven distinct operating units.  The seven operating units are: Phenol I, Phenol II, Phenol III, BPA, AMS Hydrogenation, AMS Distillation, and Cumene Oxidation.  Within these processes chlorine, the only toxic chemical regulated under 40 CFR 68, is used as a disinfectant in the four cooling water systems associated with the Phenol I, Phenol II, Phenol III, and BPA operating units to prevent biologic"

      "SummaryText": "al fouling. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe Haverhill Plant takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chlorine as detailed below.  A process hazard analysis is conducted every five years for each of the four process areas. Prior to conducting the process hazard analysis, safety information is reviewed. The safety information reviewed includes information pertaining to the hazards of the regulated substances (such as MSDSs), the technology of the process (such as flow diagrams), and the equipment in the process.  Process and safety information and operating procedures are updated when a change occurs with the process chemicals, technology, equipment, or operational procedures.  \n\nAnother element of the Haverhill Plant\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is the annual certification, which establishes that operating procedures for the processes involving chlorine are accurate and current.  To ensure that the operating procedures are correctly implemented all employees are on a three-year refresher-training schedule.  Each employee completes refresher training every three years; however, not all employees are trained simultaneously.  Training is an ongoing process at the Haverhill Plant.  Personnel are trained in chlorine emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  \n\nFurthermore, the chlorination systems are inspected and tested by maintenance personnel according to the schedule Sunoco has established as good engineering practice. The chlorination systems receive chlorine from chlorine cylinders that were constructed of steel and were designed according to guidelines set by the Chlorine Institute.  \n\nIn addition to the above listed components of an effective prevention program, the Haverhill Plant\u00bfs prevention program includes the following aspects: incident investigations, employee participation plans, hot work permits, contractor safety pr"

Furthermore, the Haverhill Plant has instituted specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that high standards for accident prevention are maintained.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nA five-year accident release report has not been prepared since there have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.   \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nSunoco has prepared a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Haverhill Plant.  The ERP for the Haverhill Plant meets all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. This plan is periodically reviewed and employees are trained in the proper execution and implementation of the prescribed procedures.  The emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, Sunoco coordinates the Haverhill Plant ERP with the Scioto County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe Haverhill Plant will incorporate or address recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses, offsite consequences, incident investigations (if any), and program audits.  For instance, the siting recommendations from the September 2002 compliance audit are expected to be completed by November 1, 2004."
