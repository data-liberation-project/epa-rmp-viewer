(Polychemie) facility in Pearlington, MS facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to protect people, property, and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities include the manufacture of water treatment polymers and related polymers.  We have four regulated substances above the RMP threshold quantity present at our facility.  The regulated toxic substances are epichlorohydrin, ethylenediamine, and ammonium hydroxide (30 percent solution).  The regulated flammable substance is dimethylamine (anhydrous).  Epichlorohydrin is used as a reactant in the Polyamine process.  The maximum amount of epichlorohydrin stored on-site is 1,000,000 pounds.  Ethylenediamine is used as a reactant in the Polyamine process.  The maximum amount of ethylenediamine stored on-site is 120,000 pounds.  Ammonium hydroxide is received and stored at the facility as a 30 percent solution. It is used as a reactant in the EDC/Ammonia process.  The maximum amount of ammonium hydroxide 30 percent solution stored on-site is 39,000 pounds (11,700 pounds pure (100 percent basis) ammonia).  Dimethylamine is received and stored as anhydrous.  It is used as a reactant in the Polyamine process and DADMAC process.  The maximum amount of dimethylamine stored on-site is 2,300,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary "

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention and process safety managements programs that are\n\nin place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\n\n\nPolychemie maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations, and environmental, health and safety, and will be revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures that address various modes of operation. The information is reviewed annually and is readily accessible to workers involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nPolychemie has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training will be provided at least every three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nPolychemie will carry out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

In addition, operating procedures and associated PSI are updated as required.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nPolychemie promptly investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from\n\nreoccurring.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nWe believe that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees will participate in the elements of PSM and RMP. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nPolychemie may use contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.   Polychemie has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work.  Contractors are also informed of emergency response duties in the event of a release or incident.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years, Polychemie has not had an accidental release of a regulated material from a covered process that resulted in a death, injury, or significant property damage on-site or known offsite death, injury, evacatian, sheltering in plac"

Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nPolychemie has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan covers aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  The plan is updated as necessary to reflect pertinent changes occurring within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  The plan is coordinated with the Hancock County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThrough the elements of the Prevention Program (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Operating Procedure Reviews, etc.), Polychemie routinely evaluates the safety of its processes and implements changes as appropriate which in turn improve process safety.\n\n\n\n"
