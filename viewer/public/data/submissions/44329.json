This rule is found at 40 CFR 68 and is intended to prevent chemical accidents that could endanger the public and/or the environment.  More than 5,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is stored at the Corsicana Plant.  The following subsections highlight the important features of the plan.\n\n2.1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is Guardian\u00bfs policy that facilities and personnel will comply with all applicable regulations and laws to prevent accidental releases.  The facility is designed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and all applicable codes and laws.  In the event of a fire, explosion, or other emergency situation, Guardian personnel will respond in accordance with written procedures and training and will contact the Corsicana Fire Department for emergency response.\n\n2.1. \tFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Guardian Corsicana Plant stores a maximum of 12,000 pounds of anhydrous SO2 in 2,000-pound cylinders.  SO2 from the cylinders is used to lubricate the ceramic roll conveyors in the tempering furnaces. Two cylinders are connected directly to the furnace.  A maximum of four additional cylinders are maintained in the storage area.  The locations of the cylinders in the process and storage areas are shown on the facility diagram. (See Appendix B)\n\n2.1.3 Worst Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would catastrophic bulk tank failure when filled to capacity, resulting in a toxic release.  Public receptors are located within the theoretical 3.1-mile (16,368 foot) toxic endpoint of 0.0078 milligrams/liter.  An alternate release scenario is the rupture of piping carrying the gas, leading to a 10-minute"
