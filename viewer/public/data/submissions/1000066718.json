TOTAL - Cray Valley policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nTo manufacture these products TCV - Grand Junction uses a regulated raw material, 1,3-butadiene (Butadiene). Butadiene is regulated because its flammable properties are similar to propane.\n\n\n\nTCV - Grand Junction understands the hazards associated with the use of Butadiene and has an accidental release prevention plan in effect. This plan is based on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan. In its plan, OSHA details training requirements for employees and precautions to be taken in manufacturing and maintenance of equipment when using hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program of TCV - Grand Junction is based on recommendations of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), \"Industrial Emergency Preparedness\" by Robert Kelly, the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) and the American Petroleum Institution (API). The program contains procedures for contacting local, state and national response centers and for notifying areas that would be affected off site.\n\n\n\n\n\n2) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance.\n\nTCV - Grand Junction receives 1,3-butadiene, a regulated substance used at this facility. TCV - Grand Junction has the equipment and trained personnel to safely unload the material when it arrives.  A railcar is delivered to the site on average every other week or 26 times a year and emptied within 7 days of delivery.  It is feasible that a railcar could be delivered with the butadiene storage vessels near their maximum intended inventory.  Therefore, the maximum intended inventory for "

      "SummaryText": "the site will assume a full railcar and the two butadiene storage vessels at maximum capacity.  The maximum intended inventory of 1,3 butadiene at the site for RMP reporting is 89,300 gallons, which is equivalent to 462,574 lbs.  No butadiene is shipped from this site. Material received is used to make TCV- Grand Junction products.\n\n\n\n\n\n3) The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst case scenario - The worst case flammable scenario would be the instantaneous release of 1,3 butadiene from the vessel containing the largest quantity of regulated substances. This vessel would be a fully loaded railcar.   The assumption would be that all of Butadiene contained in the railcar would be released and the vapor cloud would find an ignition source resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Distance to endpoint would be 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative scenario -  The alternate flammable case scenario involves a line failure while transferring 1,3-butadiene from rail car to storage tank.  This would release the content of the hose and materials from the rail car. Two inch piping and hoses are used for the transfer. The alternate case assumes a release rate of 20,000 lbs./hr. over a 60 minute time period.  The release would cause a vapor cloud formation and subsequently finding an ignition source resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Distance to endpoint would be < 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\n4) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nTCV- Grand Junction complies with EPA Accidental Release Program and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. Affected employees have been trained in release prevention and response.\n\n\n\n\n\n5) Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of butadiene that have affected an off-site receptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n6) The Emergency Response Program\n\nTCV- Grand Junction's Emergency Response Program is based on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) pr"

TCV- Grand Junction has excess flow check valves and pressure relief systems that are associated with the Butadiene system. This system is fully operational.\n\n"
