BARBERTON PLANT\r\n\r\nThe PPG Industries, Inc. facility in Barberton, Ohio, manufactures optical materials, fine chemicals and silica products.  Examples of these products include:\r\n* Plastic resins - used by customers to make eyewear lenses like Transitions photochromic  lenses;\r\n* Chloroformates - used by customers to make medicines and chemicals used by farmers;\r\n* Silicas - used by customers to flatten and thicken paints and varnishes; \r\n* Teslin - a synthetic printing sheet used by our customers to make items such as menus,  identification cards, labels and children's books; and\r\n* Safety films and coatings - found in commercial and military aircraft windows.\r\nThe Optical Material process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Planning regulation. The EPA maintains a list of regulated chemicals and the threshold amounts that require them to be included in RMP. The six chemicals regulated by the EPA and used at the Barberton facility include phosgene, chlorine, allyl alcohol, n-propyl chloroformate, ammonia and isopropyl chloroformate.  These chemicals are used in making plastic resins for eyewear lenses, medicines and chemicals used by farmers. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nThe PPG Barberton facility complies with Occupational Safety & Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule (29 CFR 1910.119), applicable Ohio and federal EPA regulations, and applicable Coast Guard and Department of Transportation requirements.  PPG also follows the Responsible Care Codes of Management Practice, including the Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Code to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG's EHS Process requires each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.  All of these activities form an integral part"

Trained personnel are the key to a safely designed, a safely operated and a safely maintained plant.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used.  These standards include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, flammable and toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, a fire water system and computer controls for the processes.  Employees at the facility receive job-appropriate training.  Safety, environmental, operating and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates, as appropriate.  Also, the Barberton facility uses maintenance and inspection programs that are designed to minimize the possibility of equipment, piping or control failures. These programs include procedures such as X-ray testing and thickness measurements.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed for each of the six toxic chemicals in the Barberton facility.  EPA rules require that a worst-case scenario be analyzed which would involve the highly unlikely release in ten minutes of the entire contents of the largest storage container.  Based on off-site consequence look-up tables and EPA guidelines and specified assumptions, a worst-case phosgene release would cause the greatest off-site impact, although it is the least-likely scenario to actually occur. PPG-Barberton has no flammable chemicals to report as required by the EPA Risk Manage"

      "SummaryText": "ment Planning regulations. \r\n\r\nAlternative-case release scenarios or planning-case scenarios were developed for phosgene, chlorine, allyl alcohol, n-propyl chloroformate, ammonia and isopropyl chloroformate.  Evaluations from these planning-case scenarios did not show an off-site impact.  These scenarios followed the guidelines provided by EPA and used the RMP Comp Software to perform the end-point calculations.  The local fire departments of the City of Barberton & the City of Norton, local emergency planning committee, Summit County LEPC, and Summit County Emergency Management Agency use the planning-case scenario information, along with PPG experts, to develop emergency response plans, train responders, perform practice drills and maintain the appropriate equipment.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Barberton facility had one accidental release of regulated substances in the past five years.  In January 2011, two chemical operators were splashed with chlorine while performing the routine task of draining condensable vapor from a vent header associated with the site's chloroformate scrubber system. It is believed the effluent splashed out of the seal loop piping due to a frozen plug and the speed and degree (2/3) at which the trainee opened the butterfly valve. No off-site injuries or off-site impacts occurred as a result of this release.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nPPG personnel are trained and ready to respond to emergencies. The local fire department personnel and other safety forces are prepared to help if needed.  Operators, supervisors and maintenance mechanics are trained in responding to various emergencies.  PPG's response plans are shared with local fire and police departments and other emergency responders.  PPG conducts emergency practice drills with its employees and local safety forces.  In addition, special emergency response equipment is located throughout the plant.  Emergency equipment is inspected and tested on a regular basis so that it i"

If necessary, local officials will notify citizens by using community sirens, announcements on local radio and TV stations and police contacting people in the area by using bullhorns and going door-to-door.  Citizens are instructed to either shelter in place or evacuate until the all clear signal is given by local officials.\r\n\r\nPLANS TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nPPG personnel are committed to looking for new ways to improve plant safety.  Some examples are:\r\n* Assessing control instruments to assure that the most reliable and effective controls are used;\r\n* Conducting and reviewing hazard assessments;\r\n* Evaluating jobs for ergonomic improvements;\r\n* Controlling plant access;\r\n* Observing job tasks to identify and correct unsafe behaviors in the work environment; and\r\n* Evaluating product handling and shipping procedures. \r\nThe Barberton facility has communicated its chemical safety and accident prevention program and risk management information to employees, community leaders and citizens of Barberton through open houses, plant tours, meetings and community newsletters.\r\n\r\nFor additional information, please call PPG-Barberton's Community Contact Line at (330) 825-1303 or access the PPG Industries, Inc. website at www.ppg.com."
