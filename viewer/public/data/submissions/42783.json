      "SummaryText": "American Water Heater Company, located at 1100 E. Fairview Ave. in Johnson City, Tennessee is a facility that manufactures residential and commercial water heaters, of which an important component is the utilization of foam insulation.  The facility operates under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 335212 and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code of 3639.\n\nAmerican Water Heater Company uses three main raw materials in the production of foam insulation: Polymeric Diphenylmethane Diisocyanate (MDI), commonly referred to as ?ISO? or Component A, Polyol (resin) also known as Component B, and the blowing agent cyclopentane. The Polyol and Cyclopentane are pre-blended together in the blending room before being combined with the ISO at the mix head on the production line.\n\nN-Pentane (CAS No: 109-66-0), a component of the Cyclopentane used by American Water Heater Company, is a substance regulated by 40 CFR 68 (EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions). N-Pentane is present as a small percentage, less than 10 percent of the Raw Material.  Based on ? 68.115(b)(2)(i) the entire mixture must be considered the regulated subtance, in which case, American Water Heater Company has in excess of 10,000 lbs on site and is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68 for N-Pentane.  Therefore, American Water Heater Company has completed the RMP regulatory requirements.\n\nAccording to the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS?s) for the Cyclopentane used at American Water Heater Company, the flashpoint of the chemical is approximately -35? F. Thus, the Cyclopentane is flammable according to the definition as contained in ? 1910.1200(c). American Water Heater Company could have a maximum storage above 10,000 pounds of the flammable Cyclopentane present in its Covered Process at any one time. This is above the applicability quantity for a flammable liquid of 10,000 pounds, as established in ? 1910.119(a)(1)(ii). Thus, American Water Heater Company has"

      "SummaryText": " determined its Johnson City, Tennessee facility is subject to the requirements of OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management (PSM).\n\nThrough preparation of this Risk Management Program / Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM), American Water Heater Company has determined that its Johnson City, Tennessee facility would be considered to be a Program 3 Level Process as defined by EPA Regulation 40 CFR 68.10(d). This determination is based on the results of the worst-case release scenario for N-Pentane (the location of public receptors being within the distance to the endpoint) presented in Section 17.0 of the PSM Plan, and the applicability of OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 to its facility. Thus American Water Heater Company has complied with the requirements for preparation and of a Program 3 RMP as contained in EPA Regulation 40 CFR 68.\n\nAmerican Water Heater Company has defined its covered process as that equipment which contains or contacts the flammable material starting at the bulk storage tank loading (or fill) connection and extending up to and including the mix heads within the foam equipment (located at the manufacturing lines). This determination was made based on the fact that once the \"B-side\" is mixed with the \"A-side\"; it is no longer a liquid and is part of a solid, non-flammable product."
