      "SummaryText": "The Reddy Ice - Dallas Plant #311 facility is a packaged ice manufacturing plant that utilizes a standard refrigeration design using ammonia as its refrigerant.  The system has five screw compressors, four evaporative condensers, ten P-34A-XL-LOF Vogt ice machines, two recirculators, a thermosyphon vessel, a controlled pressure receiver, nine evaporators and a water chiller.  A programmable logic controller (PLC) monitors the system and controls the system operation. In addition to the PLC, each of the compressors has numerous protective controls, (motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, and low oil pressure) which will shut down the compressor if operating limits are exceeded.\n\nAll five compressors use the same discharge header and condensers.  Screw compressors #1 and #2 use a common suction header that is connected to the freezer or low temp system. The low temp system consists of the freezer recirculator and nine evaporators running at 15 psig or 0? F. evaporators #1 thru #4 are used for the blast freezer. Units #5, #6 and #7 are used for the rake freezer and units #8 and #9 are used in the storage freezer.  \n\nScrew compressors #3, #4 and #5 provide suction for the icemaker or high temp system. The high temp system consists of the ice maker recirculator and 10 Vogt tube ice machines that operate at 22 to 30 psig or 8 to 17? F.  \n\nThe water chiller cools the water before it goes to the ice machines.  The chiller suction and the controlled pressure receiver are connected to the economizer ports of #1 through #5 compressors. The compressor economizer ports are regulated to operate at 75 to 83 psig or 50 to 55? F.\n\nThe controlled pressure receiver supplies liquid ammonia to the icemaker and evaporator recirculators. The ammonia is  then pumped to the ice machines and the evaporators, absorbing heat and changing state to a mixture of gas and liquid.  It leaves the ice machines and e vaporators as a low-pressure gas a"

The ammonia gas is then drawn through the compressors where it is compressed into a high pressure, hot gas and sent to the four evaporative condensers where it is cooled and condensed back into a liquid.  From the condensers it goes to the thermosyphon vessel where a portion goes to the compressor oil coolers.  The liquid ammonia not used for oil cooling is transferred back to the controlled pressure receiver.\n\nAn outside supplier will deliver anhydrous ammonia to replenish the ammonia in the system as required.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant.  The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia are the result of a lack of knowledge, misunderstanding, carelessness or poorly maintained or unsuitable equipment.  Reddy Ice/Packaged Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Dallas facility is committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the general public, and the environment.  Packaged Ice/Reddy Ice designs, constructs and operates their facilities using engineering and administrative controls as per industry codes and standards and regulatory requirements.  The standards and regulations have been developed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  In addition, these organizations reference standards set up by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). \n\nThe facility has numerous safeguards pertinent to the ammonia process.  These include multiple ammonia detection and alarm systems, automatic exhaust purge fans, automati"

Administrative controls are in place which limit the normal utilization of vessels at approximately 20% to 30% of their actual capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency response and action plan, which includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of the facility, release reporting requirements, and first responder duties."
