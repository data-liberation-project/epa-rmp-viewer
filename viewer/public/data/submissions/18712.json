Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the blending of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and used for blending in a mixing operation to make mixed-grade fertilizers for application.  The maximum quantity stored would be 70,098 pounds in the facility's tank.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 70,098 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .89 miles.\n\nThe altermative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose, with 26,638 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .78 miles.\n\nThe facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our  knowledge, have any accident"

Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committeed for coordination in the community response planning.\n\nSafety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommedations for implementation at this time."
