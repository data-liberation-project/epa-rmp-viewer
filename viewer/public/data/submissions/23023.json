Facility Policy:  The management and employees of Parkway Ag Supply are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of aqua ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with aqua ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of aqua ammonia for sale to farmers.  Aqua ammonia is received, stored and used in the production of mixed-grade liquid fertilizer for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored is 266,000 pounds of aqua ammonia which at 30% ammonia contains about 80,000 pounds of ammonia.  This facility stores aqua ammonia in 3 tanks.  \n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario:  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the maximum capacity would release the total contents or 34,000 pounds of ammonia as a liquid in a period of ten minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.56 miles.\n\nAlternative-Case Scenario:  The alternative-case scenario is assumed to be a release of 450 pounds of ammonia in a period of one minute from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer pipe.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.07 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program:   This facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of aqua ammonia.  Training is provided on safe aqua ammonia operations for employees.  \n\n5.  Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of aqua ammonia for the covered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:  This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120.  Emergency pla"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific aqua ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
