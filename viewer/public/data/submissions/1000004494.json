Emergency response procedures for the MFT facility, including the chlorine storage area, are described in MFT's Contingency Plan (CP).

The chlorine system is designed, installed, maintained, and operated in accordance with good engineering practice and industry-specific guidance developed by the Chlorine Institute and MFT's current chlorine cylinder supplier, Jones Chemicals.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo accidents involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place have occurred at MFT in the past five-year period (June 1, 2004 to June 1, 2009).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEmergency procedures described in MFT's CP will be followed in the event of an emergency involving the chlorine gas distribution system.

      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nMetal Finishing Technologies (MFT), operates a metal finishing job shop in Forestville, Connecticut. The MFT facility, which occupies approximately 3.6 acres, is situated north of the Pequabuck River and south of Camp Street. Chlorine is stored on-site at the facility and used for water treatment in the cyanide reactors. Because the quantity of chlorine stored on-site in a single process exceeds the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds, the facility is subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) provisions under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act Amendments (40 CFR Part 68), also known as the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\" Because MFT is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, MFT is subject to \"Program 3\" in the tiered RMP approach.\n\nThe primary chlorine storage facility consists of four one-ton chlorine cylinders located near the northwest corner of the building. The chlorine gas system consists of four one-ton chlorine storage tanks (two of which are used at one time), a vacuum regulator, a \"V-Notch\" control valve, an Eductor, a 2.0 HP centrifugal pump for cyanide reactor I (CNI), a 3.0 HP centrifugal pump for cyanide reactor II (CNII), a \"Y\" strainer, and associated appurtenances (flexible tubing valves, controls, PVC piping, etc.).  The chlorine system is surrounded on the north, south and east by concrete block walls and to the west by an overhead door.  Chlorine is transferred to the chlorinator via \u00c2\u00bd\" flexible teflon tubing and then to the cyanide reactor via PVC tubing.  The chlorine gas system described above comprises the \"covered process\" under this RMP.\n\nThe one-ton chlorine containers are delivered to the MFT facility by truck. The chlorine containers are unloaded outside the chlorine building using a hydraulic boom. The boom lifts the containers from the truck and enters the chlorine storage room through an overhead door. The \"covered process\" under this RMP includes"
