If an accidental release should occur,the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n        The primary activity at Kirklan Agronomy is the storage and blending of fertilizers for custom application and sales to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received , stored , and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quanity stored would be 367200 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank and 45 wagon type nurse tanks. The maximum quanity handled woud be the unloading of a semi transport holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     a. the worst-case release scenrio would be the release of the total contents of or 18,000 gallon storage\ntank released as a gas over 10 minutes the maximum quanity released would be 84,132 pounds, which is\nthe volume of our storage tank when filled to 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The \ndistance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm)is .96 miles.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario based on five year accident history(or the most likely potential incident ) is a release from a break in a 3 inch transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint is .59 miles.\n\n\n4. The accident release prevention .\n\n        Kirklin Agronomy has implemented the provisions of * Safety Requirements for the Storage\n\nand Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia k-51* published by The American National Stanards Institute,Inc. and\nthe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111* Storage and Handling of\nAnhydrous Ammonia*\n\n5.
