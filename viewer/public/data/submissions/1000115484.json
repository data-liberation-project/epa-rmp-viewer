Formulations include insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. The site stores isopropylamine in a quantity over 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program / Policies and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps [40 CFR 68.155(a,c)]\nProcess Safety Information (PSI): Written process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards of the isopropylamine used by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A process hazard analysis is updated and revalidated every five years to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards involved in the process. Recommendations are resolved and documented in a timely manner.\nOperating Procedures:  Written operating procedures have been developed for safely conducting activities consistent with the process safety information for operating steps in each operating phase. Operating procedures are certified annually that they are current and accurate. Safe work practices have also been developed for control of hazards during operations.\nEmployee Participation: A written plan has been developed regarding the implementation of employee participation. Employees are consulted on the conduct of PHAs and other process safety management elements.\nEmployee Training: A training program has been developed which ensures employees are trained\non aspects of the processes and on the safe, efficient, and effective performance of their duties.\nContractor Management: Contractors are screened and evaluated on their demonstrated safe work histories before they perform work on or near the isopropylamine process.

The review verifies safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is placed into operation.\nMechanical Integrity: The facility has developed and implemented procedures to ensure the\nisopropylamine process is built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures\nto minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures. Maintenance procedures have been developed per\nequipment vendor recommendations, federal or state regulations, or industry codes and standards.\nHot Work Permit: The facility has developed and implemented procedures to ensure a signed permit\nis obtained prior to any work which could generate a flame, intense heat, or sparks because of\nelectric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, grinding or similar activities.\nManagement of Change: The facility has developed and implemented a Management of Change (MOC) program to ensure changes made to the isopropylamine process are properly reviewed, will not result in undetected unsafe situations, and affected employees are made aware of the changes and their implications. The MOC program ensures PSI, maintenance procedures, and operating procedures are updated as necessary to reflect the changes made.\nIncident Investigation: The facility has developed and implemented procedures to ensure incidents (and near misses) involving the isopropylamine process are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\nCompliance Audits: The facility conducts audits of the prevention program every 3 years (or sooner if needed) to en"

The audit team includes persons\nknowledgeable in audit techniques and who have the appropriate process knowledge and technical\nexpertise.\n\nFive-Year Accident History [40 CFR 68.155(d)]\nThere has not been an accidental release from the covered process containing isopropylamine that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage since the startup of the covered process.\n\nEmergency Response Program and Policies [40 CFR 68.155(a,e)]\nThe site maintains a detailed Emergency Action Response Plan designed to contact the local emergency response organizations in the event of a hazardous chemical release. This Plan is periodically reviewed with outside emergency response organizations. In the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, local authorities will be notified and will determine whether an evacuation or shelter-in-place of local areas is warranted.  The local authorities will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties of any necessary action.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]\nPlatte Chemical Company (Nutrien Ag Solutions) is committed to continuous efforts to improve the safe operation of the isopropylamine process by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the equipment and the process. The process is designed in accordance with good engineering practices. Periodic auditing of the PSM/RMP Programs ensures process changes or modifications are evaluated and necessary safety precautions and/or safety improvements are made before changes are made."
