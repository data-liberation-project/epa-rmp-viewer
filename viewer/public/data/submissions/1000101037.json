MBPP has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., City of Mont Belvieu Police Dept).  This capability provides a means of notifying the public of an incident as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic MAMB meetings, MBPP conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the MAMB organization.

These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through many small improvement steps.  Some examples are the implementation of recommendations from our hazard reviews and incident investigations.  Other examples are the improvement steps that result from our reviews of operating and mechanical procedures systems, which are tightly integrated with our training programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nRMP COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMUNITY DIALOGUE\r\n\r\nMBPP views RMP as an opportunity to build onto existing community outreach programs and open new and continuing dialogue with our neighbors.  Our communications goal is to go beyond the requirements defined in the RMP rule, and the RMP rule is one mechanism to educate and inform the Mont Belvieu community about the safety measures in place and the close working relationship we have with the local mutual aid infrastructure (MAMB), Mont Belvieu Police, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)."

This process and the other four RMP Program 1 processes are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, Exxon Mobil Corporation has implemented OIMS at each of its operations worldwide.  OIMS includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program.  As previously mentioned, OIMS has been deemed equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\r\n\r\nAdditional details for the Raw Materials and Storage process are included in the Prevention Program Data Elements (PPDE) section of this Risk Management Plan.
