Kieffer, President/General Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.\tThe Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of the Farmers Cooperative Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n2.\tFacility Information\n\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to \tfarmers.\n\n- Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. \n\n- The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 pounds in our one-30,000 gallon \tstorage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi trailer \tholding 42,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage \ttank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The  maximum quantity released would be  \t140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity \tas limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 2.50 miles.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release \tfrom a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .83 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage \tand Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National \tStandards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health \tAdministration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and handling of anhydrous \t\tammonia\".\n\n\n5"

Periodic evaluations are \tperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific \tanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexsmt.wpd"
