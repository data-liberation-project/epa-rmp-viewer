      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Dublin's Risk Management Plan for Safe Chlorination Handling involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases.  All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe City of Dublin's Surface Water Plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect raw water pumped from the Oconee River and as a post filtration disinfectant on this same water.   Finished water from this facility serves the residents and industries of Dublin.  The City of Dublin's Water Pollution Control Plant uses chlorine to disinfect the effluent wastewater before it is discharged into the Oconee River.  Both chlorination processes include 1- ton chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, an instrument room/panel, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment.\n\nFor each chlorination process, accidental release modeling was performed for the respective area to determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in accidental chlorine release.  The first \"worst case\" scenario, defined by EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the... maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  The \"alternative scenario\" is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"  For the City of Dublin's Surface Water and Water Pollution Control Plant and incident history review was performed to identify the most likely case scenario.\n\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before it's concentration decreases to a theoretical \"toxic endpoint\".  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is bel"

      "SummaryText": "ieved that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life threatening health effects.\"  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the City of Dublin's Surface Water Treatment Plant and Water Pollution Control Plant involves a one-ton cylinder yielding a cumulative release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  When atmospheric dispersion modeling for this unlikely scenario was performed using the EPA guidance document, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles was obtained for each plant.\n\nThe alternative release (more likely) scenario for both chlorination process involves the mechanical failure of  a  header valve connection or the packing nut  allowing the accidental release of 82 lbs. of chlorine over a one hour period.  Similar atmospheric modeling per EPA Guidance yields a more likely figure of 0.1mile affected radius under normal atmospheric conditions at each site.  Within these parameters, there were no receptors.  In support of the probability that a worst case accidental will not occur, a review process history indicates that no reportable accidental releases (greater than a 10 lb. quantity) have occurred within the past five years at either facility.\n\nThe City of Dublin's Utilities Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards.\n*   Operator Training\n*   Prevention Maintenance Program \n*   Process Specific Safety Equipment\n*   Safe and effective standard operating procedures, written with operator \nparticipation\n*   Hazard review of equipment and procedures \n*    Auditing and inspection programs.\n*   Comprehensive Management Program\n\nFurthermore, the Surface Water Plant and the Water Pollution Control Plant have an active environmental, health and safety program with the following elements specifica"

Preventative measures will provide for the continuous improvement of communications and will maintain effective procedures for the safe handling of and timely emergency response to potential chlorine hazards."
