The facility's alternate (feasible scenario affecting off-site receptors) release scenario is a BLEVE incident involving one (1) railcar resulting in a fireball.\n\n\n\nThe Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals - Star LPG Tank Car Storage Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\n\n\nTo date, this facility has never had an accident involving butane, which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in-place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals - Star LPG Tank Car S"
