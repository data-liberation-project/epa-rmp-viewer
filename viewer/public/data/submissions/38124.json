Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Stanislaus Farm Supply Company, Modesto facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 624 East Service Road, Modesto, CA, 95358 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and regulated pesticides.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\n?    The primary activity at the Stanislaus Farm Supply ? Modesto Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n    \n?    Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  No federally regulated pesticides are handled at Stanislaus Farm Supply ? Modesto Facility.\n    \n?    Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in 2 above ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in stationary storage tanks is 112,000 pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is transferred to 95 field application tanks. The field application tanks are stored at the Facility until they transported to the end-user. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in field application tanks is 301,000 pounds.\n    \n?    Aqua ammonia is received by tanker truck or from the on-site converter and stored in 2 above ground tank(s) at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 225,000 pounds.\n    \n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented"
