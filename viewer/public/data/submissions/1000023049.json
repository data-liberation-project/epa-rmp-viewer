It is Producers Dairy Foods, Inc.A?s policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Producers Dairy Foods, Inc.A?s objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nAdditionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nProducers Dairy Foods, Inc. owns and operates a milk and milk products processing facility located on East Belmont Avenue in Fresno, California.  The corporate office and mailing address is 250 E. Belmont.  \n\nThe ammonia-based refrigeration system at Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. provides cooling for the raw milk tanks, process equipment (water chiller, glycol chillers, and ice makers), pasteurized milk tanks, cold storage rooms, and two cold storage warehouses.  The major components of the refrigeration system are:\ncompressors\nevaporative condensers\nhigh pressure receiver\nrecirculator package\nflooded evaporators (cold storage warehouses)\ndirect expansion evaporators (cold storage rooms)\nglycol chillers\nwater chiller\nice builders\nsuction accumulators\n\nThe largest vessel in the refrigeration system at Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is approximately 32,735 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been develop"

The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and the PHAs have been updated and revalidated.\n\n Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and will be reviewed at least annually.\n\n Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\n\n Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n Pre-startup safety reviews are performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n Audits have been conducted to evaluate compliance with the CalARP regulations.\n\n Incident investigation procedures have been established.\n\n A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation has been developed and implemented.\n\n Hot work permits are issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the ammonia system.\n\n A Contractor Safety Policy has been developed and implemented.\n\nTo ensure that the general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps are implemented, Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. has assigned overall responsibility for the RMP elements to the Operations Manager.

Several of the improvements to the refrigeration system enhance the safety of the system, including the following:\n\n Installation of new and rebuilt modern compressors along with a new control system.  \n\n Installation of new evaporative condensers to lower the condensing pressure.  \n\n Installation of foundations for the new and relocated equipment that were designed to current seismic code requirements.   \n\n Installation of a pressure relief header for new and existing equipment.\n\n Installation of a new ammonia diffusion system with a 33,000 gallon (nominal capacity) water tank.\n\n Installation of new pressure relief valves and pressure relief header.  \n\n Installation of a visual system (i.e. rupture disk/pressure gauge system) to detect operation of a pressure relief valve(s).  \n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system."
