Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use.   Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material\n\nM&B Products is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community.  Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68) our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.\n\n \n\nThe facility is filing at this time as a result of a consolidation of 2 refrigeration systems not previously covered by PSM/RMP  into a single expanded system containing more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia with new equipment, new safeguards and PLC control.  \n\n \n\nThe facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the last 5 years.\n\nA copy of the sites emergency plans is being sent to the Hillsborough County and City of Temple Terrace, FL LEPC and local fire departments.   \n\n\n\nInspection of the facility by the local fire department occurs annually.\n\n \n\nThrough our RMP program, M&B looks continuously for possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in our facility.   \n\n"
