Founded in 1924,  Univar  USA\r\nsupplies    the   food   industry,   chemical   compounders,\r\npharmaceuticals,  mining,  forest  products,  oil  and   gas\r\nproducers,   electronics,  coatings  and  many   other   key\r\nindustries  with  the  raw chemical  materials  required  to\r\nproduce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\r\nUnivar  USA Inc. is a member of the National Association  of\r\nChemical   distributors  (NACD)  and   complies   with   the\r\nResponsible  Distribution Process (RDP),  an  environmental,\r\nhealth and safety improvement initiative.\r\nSome  of  the  products  stored and handled  by  Univar  are\r\nsubject  to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR  Part\r\n68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation  and\r\nsubmission of an RMP Plan, contained herein. The contents of\r\nthe RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive\r\nSummary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\r\n\r\n1. Prevention Program\r\n     Processes  that  are subject to OSHA's  Process  Safety\r\n     management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's\r\n     RMP  rule  are  subject  to the  Program  3  Prevention\r\n     program.  Univar USA Inc. has documented the Prevention\r\n     Program   in  its  Process  Safety  Management  Manual.\r\n     Briefly,   this   program   includes   provisions   and\r\n     requirements for:\r\n     > Process Safety Information\r\n     > Process Hazard Analysis\r\n     > Operating Procedures\r\n     > Training\r\n     > Mechanical Integrity\r\n     > Management\r\n     of Change >\r\n     Pre-Startup\r\n     Review\r\n  > Compliance\r\n     Audits\r\n     > Incident\r\n     Investigatio"

This Plan\r\nis shared with local emergency responders who\r\nhave access to Univar facility personnel (and up-\r\nto-date phone numbers). Univar responds to minor\r\nincidents but will call in professional\r\nemergency responders in the event of all other\r\nincidents.\r\nUnivar  USA  Inc.  invites  and encourages\r\nlocal  emergency responders  such  as  the  fire\r\ndepartment  to  visit   and familiarize\r\nthemselves with Univar products and facilities.\r\nJoint emergency exercises are conducted when\r\npossible.\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\r\nUnivar USA Inc. in St. Paul is a distributor for\r\n35% and 37% solutions of formaldehyde.  These\r\nsolutions are used as mild reducing agents in\r\nproprietary electroless plating products, and\r\nin  livestock  rearing and dairy farms  to\r\ntreat  hoof maladies in cattle, sheep, goats,\r\nand horses, for instance.\r\n\r\nThese  solutions are stored in 55 gallon plastic\r\ndrums which are   compliant   with   all\r\napplicable   regulations   for transportation\r\nby highway per the federal  DOT  laws.   The\r\nnumber   of   drums   at  this  Univar\r\nfacility   contains formaldehyde  in  amounts\r\nmoderately above  the  EPA's   RMP regulatory\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S)\r\nTrained forklift operators, strong containers,\r\nand a  secure facility minimize the potential\r\nfor a chemical release.  The worst  case is the\r\nrelease of 485 pounds (one full drum)  of 37%\r\nformaldehyde solution over a 10 minute period.\r\nThis  is a      release of 180 pounds of pure\r\nformaldehyde, at a rate  of\r\n18  pounds  per  minute.   Under these\r\nconditions,  without mitigation,  a  toxic\r\nconcentration of formaldehyde  vapors would  be\r\npresent out to about 320 feet from  the  pool\r\nof liquid.\r\n\r\nThe  vapor"
