INVISTA?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Waynesboro facility is operated by INVISTA to produce Lycra? and Elaspan? brand spandex and BCF Nylon carpet fibers.  The branded spandex is made in two separate but similar facilities.  The older plant was put into service in the early 1960?s and is referred to as the Classic plant.  The Classic facility is located near the center of the plant. The newer, state-of-the-art building is referred to as NAX (North American eXpansion), and is located near the plant-north east area by the main gate.  The Classic and NAX production facilities consist of three basic areas: polymer processing, spinning and recovery. The BCF Nylon building is located on the east end of the plant. This facility produces nylon fiber. The BCF facility has the capability to produce Nylon flake, but this process has not been used for a few years. The fiber is used in the manufacturing of carpets and the flake is used in the production of automobile safety air bags.  The site also has the Benger R&D facility and a Chemistry l"

      "SummaryText": "ab.  Both of these facilities have the primary responsibility of support for spandex operations.\n\nThe site also has its own Powerhouse and coal handling systems.  The Powerhouse has three boilers, which burn predominantly coal, but can also burn oil.  There are three Dowtherm vaporizers, which provide heat to the nylon fiber operation at the facility.  Vaporizers #1 and #2 are mainly fueled by natural gas and residual oil; however they have the design capability to use distillate oil as well. Vaporizer #3 was installed in 1997 and is fueled by only gas.  \n\n\nIn the spandex facilities polymer processing uses an aromatic diisocyanate (Diphenylmethane diisocyanate ? MDI) combined with glycol in a heated reactor to form the base polyurethane polymer, or ?capped glycol.?  A polymer solution called ?diluted capped glycol? is formed by the addition of a solvent ?N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc).  The diluted capped glycol solution is transferred to a second reactor where various reagents are added to determine the properties of the polymer, such as chain length.\n\nIn the BCF Nylon area, adipic acid (HAD) and hexamethylene diamine (HMD) are unloaded from railcars into storage tanks at the raw material tank farm area.  The HAD and HMD go to a primary reactor which is controlled by a water scrubber equipped with a single spray nozzle that injects material back into the process.  A secondary reactor introduces more HMD and produces nylon salt.\n\nNylon salt is then introduced into the continuous polymerization (CP) area where it goes through a pre-evaporator and pre-polymerizer process prior to being sent to the spinning area.  In the spinning area, the nylon goes through a lubricating (primary finish), heating, drawing and bulking process before being wound onto tubes.  \n\nEthylenediamine (1,2-Ethanediamine) is the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Waynesboro facility in amounts above threshold quantity.  This chemical is "

The facility is regulated under the Program Level 1 requirements.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by INVISTA.  These high standards include:\n\n?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n?    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Waynesboro facility is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?    A tank and delivery containment system that will easily accommodate a complete release of Ethylenediamine from both tanks if they were at full capacity.\n?    Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n?    Minimizing the possibility of a release of Ethylenediamine by having emergency shutdown systems at the loading areas.\n?    Reducing the risk of overfilling by having level alarms and/or indicators on storage tanks and bullets.\n?    Implementing procedures for loading/unloading operations that help prevent a truck driver from drivin"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Virginia State Police, the Waynesboro police and fire department and Augusta Medical Center.  The City of Waynesboro Fire Chief has the authority to assume Incident Command (IC) of any emergency scene or incident within the boundaries of the City of Waynesboro.  In his absence, the Department on duty shift Commander will serve in his capacity. The INVISTA Emergency Services Team Leader shall act as the INVISTA Incident Commander.  The INVISTA Plant Manager or his designate has overall responsibility for Site personnel, buildings, and equipment.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n    \n\n    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n    \n    Compliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n    \n?
