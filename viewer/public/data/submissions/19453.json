We\n\nwill conduct our operations in a responsible, healthful,\n\nsafe, and environmentally sound manner through compliance\n\nwith all applicable environmental, health and safety laws,\n\nregulations, and company policies and procedures.  In\n\nkeeping with this policy, our objective is to reduce waste\n\nand continually reduce any impact on air, water, and land\n\nthat we may have, through the implementation of effective\n\nenvironmental controls and training of our employees.\n\n\n\nIt is Ameripol Synpol Corporation's policy to take every\n\nprecaution possible to insure that a release of a hazardous\n\nsubstance does not occur. If a release of a hazardous\n\nsubstance does occur that all personnel are properly trained\n\nto react to and correct the release before it can reach\n\nharmful limits. All plant personnel are trained in emergency\n\nresponse to chemical releases.  Special teams are assigned\n\nand trained on each shift to deal with any possible release\n\nof hazardous chemicals. All plant personnel are trained\n\nannually on emergency response procedures.  The emergency\n\nresponse procedure is exercised at least once every three\n\nmonths. The exercises are evaluated and the results briefed\n\nto senior management and plant personnel.  Emergency\n\nresponse agencies from the city of Odessa are included in\n\nsome of the exercises conducted with in the plant.\n\n\n\nAll information on chemicals used in the plant is available\n\nto all personnel 24 hours a day. Plant drawings are readily\n\navailable to all personnel via computer and paper copies.\n\nAll equipment safety ratings and safety equipment has been\n\nchecked to insure that it complies with recognized and\n\ngenerally accepted Good Engineering Practices.\n\n\n\nAn exhaustive review of each part of each process has been\n\naccomplished to identify any possible hazards, and to\n\nimplement any engineering or administrative controls"

The primary raw materials are\n\nStyrene and Butadiene with various additives such as carbon\n\nblack, and soaps.\n\n\n\nThe process uses two regulated chemicals that fall under the\n\nRisk Management Plan rule; ammonia and butadiene. The\n\nmaximum intended inventory for ammonia is 58,026 pounds and\n\nmaximum intended inventory in one of our butadiene storage\n\nvessels is 1,153,000 pounds. We have two storage vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR 1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n\n     DESCRIPTION OF CASE\n\n\n\n     Per the regulation, the worst case assumes the\n\n     rupturing of one of the storage vessels.  The entire\n\n     contents of 1,153,00 pounds of butadiene is assumed to\n\n     be released to the atmosphere in ten minutes.  The\n\n     butadiene it then assumed to contact an ignition source\n\n     and detonate.\n\n     \n\n     A pressure wave of 1 psig would extend out for 0.84\n\n     miles. A 1-psig force will knock a person down. The\n\n     estimated residential population within this distance\n\n     is 1523. The storage tank is located 0.38 miles from\n\n     the North property line.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE CASE (MOST LIKELY) FOR 1,3 BUTADIENE\n\n\n\n\n\n     DESCRIPTION OF CASE\n\n\n\n     A rail car containing 30,000 gallons of butadiene tips\n\n     over and cracks. The contents of the rail car are\n\n     released in 20 minutes.\n\n     \n\n     Based on the RMP's Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n     document, one has to consider several scenarios for the\n\n     alternative release case.  They are vapor cloud fire,\n\n     pool fire, BLEVE, vapor cloud explosion, and a jet fire\n\n     from a hole.  We eliminated the jet fire case since the\n\n     butadiene is stored under relatively low pressure (<50\n\n     psig).  A BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor\n\n     Explosion) is associated wit"

The rail car is more likely to\n\n     fail due to the impact of derailing rather than an\n\n     external fire.  We considered a pool fire case even\n\n     though the butadiene will rapidly evaporate into a\n\n     vapor.\n\n     \n\n     Consequences of this case:\n\n     \n\n     The distance from the rail car to a radiant heat\n\n     exposure of 5 Kilowatts per square meter was calculated\n\n     to be 1917 feet.
