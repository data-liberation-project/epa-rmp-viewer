(R&M)\nSUNOCO CHEMICAL'S LA PORTE PLANT\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nAt Sunoco Chemical's La Porte Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of improvements made at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nOur facility produces prolypropylene using a variety of chemicals and unit operations.  The process utilizes the regulated flammable substance propylene along with catalysts, hydrogen and ethylene as feedstocks.  The process contains the RMP-regulated substance propylene above the threshold quantity in storage vessels and numerous reactors, columns, tanks and piping within the unit.  The process also utilizes titanium tetrachloride in quantities well below the RMP threshold quantity. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the envir"

This is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nWe actively encourage participation from all employees in every aspect of process safety management.  Process safety information on chemicals used, process technology and equipment design is readily available to all employees.  Employees participate in HAZOP revalidation studies and HAZOP studies required by our Management of Change Program.  Procedures are set up to provide knowledge to ensure employees perform their jobs safely and correctly.  Employee suggestions for improvement are encouraged.  Experienced employees are involved in training.  Employees and contractors are trained and are included in the investigation of incidents and accidents.\n\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change policy, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews ensure that new installations or modifications are safe for startup and continued operation.  Our Mechanical Integrity Program has written procedures to assure that affected process equipment is properly and safely maintained.  The La Porte Plant's Hot Work Permit policy is strictly enforced to ensure that hot work in potentially dangerous areas does not occur.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention progr"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  In the past five years, there have been no releases of propylene or other chemicals at the La Porte Plant that have had an adverse impact on employees, the community, or the environment.  If an incident were to occur, we would conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root cause of the events.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan which provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) and community emergency response plans (LEPC).  We utilize the CAER hotline to alert the community in the event of danger.\n\nRECENT CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we have implemented at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n- Implemented Behavior Based Safety Process in 2004\n- Implemented Total Event Reporting in 2004\n- Implemented Safety Recognition Program in 2004\n- Upgraded Emergency Operations Center\n- Acquired new \"Quick Attack\" Emergency Response Vehicle\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n- Plant alarm system with voice notification for type and location of emergency\n- New foam fire truck engine for Houston Operations\n- Muster system electronic headcount system"
