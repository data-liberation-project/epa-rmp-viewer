There is a process in place for the management team to review all potential process changes, including recommendations following process hazard analysis and compliance audits.

Under Program Level 1, Hilti is only required to include data for the worst-case release scenario, and therefore, only a worst-case scenario is included with this submittal.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe Hilti Lewisville Distribution Center is not required to implement the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations because they are eligible for RMP Program Level 1.\nHowever, the Hilti Lewisville Distribution Center is required to comply with the requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of flammable or explosive chemicals codified under the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119). The required elements of the PSM prevention program are listed below:\n-\tEmployee Participation\n-\tProcess Safety Information\n-\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n-\tOperating Procedures\n-\tContractors\n-\tPre-startup Safety Review\n-\tMechanical Integrity\n-\tHot Work Permit\n-\tManagement of Change\n-\tIncident Investigation\n-\tEmergency Planning and Response\n-\tCompliance Audits\nThese items, their specific requirements, and how the Hilti Lewisville Distribution Center will comply with the requirements are addressed in the RMP / PSM Implementation Program document.\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nThe Hilti Lewisville Distribution Center has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years."

(Hilti), a construction equipment and chemicals supplier, leases a warehouse located at 800 W Round Grove Rd BLD 3, Lewisville, TX (Lewisville Distribution Center). The Lewisville Distribution Center houses various construction tools, fasteners, and chemicals, including insulation foams and sealants in the form of aerosol cans. The aerosol foam cans are received at the warehouse inbound area in full pallet format, generally up to 12 cans per carton with a maximum of 64 cartons per pallet. All flammable aerosols are stored together within a chain-link fenced cage inside the temperature-controlled facility. Customer pick orders list the number of individual cans, cartons, or pallets of material that are selected for relocation to the outbound area. These aerosols contain propellants that include flammable substances that are subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements as a flammable mixture. There is no bulk (drum, tote, tank) storage or chemical processing operations at the site. The regulated chemicals at the Lewisville Distribution Center consist of aerosol propellants a"
