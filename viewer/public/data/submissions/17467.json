(Note: maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of storage tank size)\n\nIII. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 157,896 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS 2.61 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS .83 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nA. THE FACILTY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISION OF THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PIUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE INC.\n\nB. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE STANDARDS OF THE US OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\nV.
