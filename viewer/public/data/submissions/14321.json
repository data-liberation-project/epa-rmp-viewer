Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Greater Pine Island Water Association Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment Facility is required to provide disinfection to the finished water prior to discharge for public consumption.  Chlorine gas is used to achieve the level of disinfection required under state and federal regulations.  Chlorine is considered a toxic substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and because quantities above the 2,500 pound threshold limit are stored on-site, a Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant in wastewater and drinking water also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to on-site personnel, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of the Greater Pine Island Water Association to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which chlorine is handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facilities, safe handling procedures of the operators, and the training of personnel.\n\nThe Greater Pine Island Water Association's Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment Facility's emergency response program is based upon the Lee County Hazardous Material Emergency Plan. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Greater Pine Island Fire Department and through a mutual aid agreement throughout Lee County, the Fort Myers Fire Department Hazmat Team and the Cape Coral Fire Department Hazmat Team.   \n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of the Greater Pine Island Water Association Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment facility is to provide a clean, safe, palatable drinking water that meets all the Federal requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act in addition to all applicable sta"

      "SummaryText": "te and local regulations.  The chlorine is received via truck from P.B.&S. Chemical. This facility has equipment for unloading the delivery trucks and storing the 2,000 pound containers.  Access to these sites is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, contractors and engineering consultants.  Chlorine is the only substance at these facilities regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  The total inventory of chlorine stored at these facilities is 8,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Catastrophic failure of a 1-ton chlorine container due to corrosion, impact, or structural defects.  It is assumed that all 2,000 pounds of the chlorine is released as vapor, which is heavier than air, in 10-minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L was determined to be 0.9 miles using to the EPA model RMP*Comp.  The affected area would include one elementary school and residential areas.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of chlorine gas through the 5/16-inch diameter valve body opening.  It is assumed that a 317 pound chlorine gas release occurs with a maximum average sustained release rate of 10.5 pounds per minute for a 60 minute duration.  The distance to endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L was determined to be 0.1 miles using the EPA model RMP*Comp.  There would be no public receptors for this scenario.  \n\nPrior to acceptance of the 1-ton chlorine containers, each container is inspected for visual defects that may cause an accidental release.  The chlorination system operates under vacuum pressure and is inspected daily. \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention R"

This facility was designed and is operated in accordance with recommendations from the American Water Works Association, Ten State Standards, and federal and state codes and regulations.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the Lee County Hazardous Material Emergency Plan. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Greater Pine Island Fire Department and through a mutual aid agreement with the Lee County, the Fort Myers Fire Department Hazmat Team and the Cape Coral Fire Department Hazmat Team.   \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility was constructed in 1994 and uses reverse osmosis along with chlorination to provide clean, palatable, and disinfected potable water.  The changes that have occurred since the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) meeting held on March 10, 1999 include the development of a standard operating procedure (SOP) for daily and emergency chlorine handling, the closing of the main entrance to the chlorine storage area, and the posting of more warning signs indicating a chlorine hazard."
