THIS COMPANY IS A FULL SERVICE FARM SUPPLY COMPANY WITH THE GREATEST RISK OF RELEASE COMING FROM OUR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE TANKS.

IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR, OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. tHIS LOCATION HAS 2 BULK TANKS AND 35 NURSE TANKS. THIS FACILITY HAS THE CAPACITY TO STORE 363,000 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THE STORAGE TANKS ARE LOCATED 1 MILE WEST OF LAMONI ON THE NORTH SIDE OF MAIN STREET. THE VALVES ARE LOCATED ON THE EAST END OF THE TANKS. THE NURSE TANK FILL STATION IS LOCATED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE TANKS. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE IN THE AMOUNT OF131,000 POUNDS. THE RELEASE WOULD BE 13,100 POUNDS PER MINUTE FOR 10 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 1.5 M/SEC. WIND SPEED, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE 4.4 MI. AFFECTING 2319 PEOPLE. THE ALTERNATE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE. THE QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 2,800POUNDS AT A RATE OF280 POUNDS PER MINUTE FOR 10 MINUTES ASSUMING A 3M PER SECOND WIND SPEED AFFECTING 15 PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IN EFFECT. THE FACILITY HAS BEEN REVIEWED FOR GENERAL COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.
