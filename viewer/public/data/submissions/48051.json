The Risk Management Program rule was issued and is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rule, \u00bfChemical Accident Prevention (CAP) Provisions\u00bf (Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)), applies to a wide variety of facilities that handle, manufacture, store or use toxic and/or highly flammable substances.\r\nAgri-Mark stores 12,900 pounds of ammonia at their manufacturing facility on 869 Exchange Street in Middlebury, Vermont.  Agri-Mark is required to address the requirements of the CAP regulations because they exceed the 10,000 pound ammonia threshold. \r\nAgri-Mark owns and operates the Middlebury facility, which produces cheese and other dairy related products.  The purpose of the ammonia is as a heat transfer medium for the facility\u00bfs refrigeration system.  A total of 12,900 pounds of ammonia is maintained in the closed loop refrigeration system.\r\nAgri-Mark is also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29\u00a0CFR 1910.119.  The State of Vermont has been delegated authority for OSHA compliance.  There are also a number of other chemicals used at the facility, which are addressed in Agri-Mark\u00bfs EMERGENCY RESPONSE Plan.\r\nThe Risk Management Plan contains the policies and procedures used at Agri-Mark to assure continued compliance with the EPA CAP and OSHA PSM regulations.  Most of the documents that are part of the Risk Management Plan follow a standard format that includes the purpose, organization, responsibilities and authorities, as well as general instructions.  Section references are shown throughout this document in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS for reference purposes.\r\nM"

Typically, documents are periodically revised through the procedures outlined in SECTION 9 - MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE.  \r\nAffected employees are encouraged to review the Risk Management Plan\u00bfs policies and procedures.  The manual is available for review by employees at the facility.  Recommendations to improve the plan\u00bfs accuracy or effectiveness in assuring employee, visitor and contractor safety can be directed to the Risk Management Planning Coordinator.\r\nThe goal of the Risk Management Plan is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) required EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. \r\nThe phrase Risk Management Program refers to the requirements of Part 68, which must be implemented on an on-going basis. The phrase Risk Management Plan refers to this document as well as the registration information submitted to EPA.\r\nCovered facilities must develop and implement a Risk Management Plan and maintain documentation required by the plan on site.  The Risk Management Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.\r\nCovered facilities also must submit registration information (RMP Submit) to EPA no later than June 21, 1999 or the date on which the facility first has more than a threshold quantity in use or stored at the site, whichever is later.  Covered facilities are also required to re-submit their Risk Management Plans every five years.  The RMP Submit provides an electronic summary of the faci"

This section discusses various duties that must be addressed in order to fulfill the intent of the Plan.  This section also describes the employee responsibilities associated with each duty.\r\nMr. Bernie Boudreau, Operations Manager, is identified as the facility Risk Management Program Coordinators (RMPC).  However, development and execution of the Risk Management Plan is performed by a team of individuals.  The roles and requirements of these individuals are documented in RMP TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES.\r\nSection 3 - Hazard Assessment\r\nA major component of the Risk Management Plan is the assessment of impacts associated with the accidental release of regulated substances.  This section evaluates both the worst-case release as well as alternative releases that are specific to the site.\r\nThe analysis focused on the impact to neighboring areas called receptors.  Receptors include residences, schools, parks, prisons, commercial buildings, etc.  Graphic as well as tabulated exhibits help to define the impact of accidental releases.\r\nBased on guidelines provided by EPA in the 2004 RMP Submit Instruction Manual, release scenario information is not provided in this Executive Summary.\r\nSection 4 - Process Safety Information\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is a repository for information related to the safety of a process.  Three major subjects addressed in this section are:\r\n* The hazards of the chemicals and the process (physical properties, toxicity and exposure limits, fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability, corrosivity data)\r\n* The process technology (process chemistry, process flow diagrams, safe oper"

This documentation is found primarily in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), the Risk Management Plan and the Process Safety Information files.  \r\nSection 5 - Process Hazard Analysis\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) is a systematic approach toward evaluating the safety of a process.  PHAs must address the hazards of a process, previous incidents having potential for serious consequences, engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors and an evaluation of the range of exposures if controls fail.  If there is more than one process, a schedule for completing PHAs must be formulated and be based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees, the age of the process and the operating history of the process.  \r\nEmployees must have input into the prioritization of PHAs and this schedule must be fully communicated to affected employees.  PHAs must follow a standard methodology, such as a What If/Checklist Analysis and be performed by a cross-functional team with at least one person who is familiar with the process, at least once every five years.  A system for addressing, resolving, documenting and communicating the recommendations in a prompt manner must also be in place.\r\nTypical documentation should include: \r\n* Information on how PHA studies were prioritized\r\n* Employee briefings on the PHAs\r\n* A copy of each PHA file index\r\n* Evidence of how PHA recommendations were completed.  \r\nThese PHA files include the pertinent process safety information.\r\nThe original PHA was conducted on Au"

They must be appropriate, clear, consistent and well communicated.  Procedures must address steps for each operating phase (initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operation, normal shutdown, startup after a turnaround), operating limits (consequences of deviation, steps to correct or avoid) and safety and health considerations (properties/hazards of chemicals, precautions to avoid exposure, control measures in the event contact occurs, quality control, inventory control, special or unique hazards, safety systems & their function).

Substantive changes to the procedures are noted in a controlled manner.  If substantial changes to the ammonia system require revision to the operating procedures, such changes are tracked through the Management of Change process.\r\nSection 7 Employee Training Program\r\nInitial training must be provided for employees involved with Risk Management Program processes that cover an overview of the process, specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown and other safe work procedures that may be applicable.  For existing employees, the employer must document that operators have the required knowledge and do not need initial training.

Contractors also perform preventative maintenance functions on the ammonia system on a quarterly basis.\r\nAgri-Mark maintains maintenance records in the form of completed work orders from the designated contractors.  Additionally, unusual conditions are documented in the refrigeration system recordkeeping notebook, which is reviewed by the contractor during quarterly preventative maintenance activities.\r\nAgri-Mark certifies that their ammonia system was designed in accordance with recognized engineering standards at the time of construction and during subsequent renovations to the system.  The systems were also visually observed during the Process Hazard Analysis.  The facility follows the manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations for inspection and maintenance found in the Operations and Maintenance Manuals.\r\nSection 9 - Management of Change\r\nA system is used to properly manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The Management of Change (MOC) form must include the technical basis for the change; impact of the change on employee safety & health; modifications to operating procedures; modifications to Process Safety Information; time period involved; and authorization requirements.  Employees and contractors must be informed of the change prior to implementation.\r\nTypical documentation should include MOC worksheets (including employee review sheets) and documentation from training meetings required for a particular MOC.  The Agri-Mark Risk Management Plan maintains a procedure and forms necessary to manage change.  Agri-Mark implements the MOC process whenever making changes to the ammonia system that is not replacement-in-kind o"

The review includes: \r\n* Confirmation that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\r\n* Safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place\r\n* The action items have been addressed; and that training of employees is complete\r\nTypical documentation includes specific training performed for hazard review team members prior to their participation in a preliminary hazard review or pre-startup safety review.  The review documentation is filed in the PSSR File and includes background information on how recommendations were implemented.  These files also include the pertinent process safety information.\r\nWhile there have been additions and improvements to the ammonia refrigeration system since the Risk Management Plan was initiated in August 1999, there have been no changes to the system that require a formal PSSR.\r\nSection 11 - Compliance Audits\r\nEmployers must certify that they have evaluated facility compliance with the Risk Management Program at least every 3 years.  Certification involves verification that procedures and practices for Risk Management Program elements are adequate and are being followed.  The audit must be performed by a team, with at least one person who is knowledgeable in the process.  A report must be generated that documents deficiencies and corrections.\r\nTypical documentation should include completed compliance audits, including evidence of how recommendations were implemented and attendance sheets from meetings conducted to review the audit findings with employees.\r\nTighe & Bond conducted a compliance audit of Agri-Mark\u00bfs ammonia refrigeration system and Risk Management Program on June 24, 2005.

This investigation must identify the chain of events and uses of the incident and include corrective measures that can be developed and implemented.  A team must perform the investigation with at least one person knowledgeable in the process and others who have appropriate knowledge and experience; a representative of the contractor or the chemical supplier must also be part of the team if either were involved in the incident.  A complete incident report must be developed and a system must be in place that addresses and communicates recommendations in a timely manner.\r\nTypical documentation should include completed Investigation Report Forms, including evidence of how action items were implemented and attendance sheets from meetings conducted to review the incident with employees.\r\nOn February 25, 2007, Agri-Mark detected a leak from the refrigeration system piping around the 640 cooler zone.  This leak was caused by substantial snow load pushing down on three valve clusters causing minor leaks at the gaskets.  The Agri-Mark emergency response team investigated and isolated the leak using self-contained breathing apparatus within three hours of the incident being reported.\r\nSince the leak resulted in an atmospheric release (20 \u00bf 40 pounds estimated) and minor injuries were sustained during the initial investigation of the leak, this incident was subject to the investigation requirements in 40 CFR 68.81.  An investigation was initiated within 24 hours of the incident and an investigation report was created.  A revised RMP was submitted in April 2007, within 6 months of the incident, as required in 40 CF"
