FACILITY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY.\n\n  THE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF SOUTHERN FS, INC  ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT., OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE\nTO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n  THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY,  WHICH IS LOCATED AT 510 WEST KASKASKIA STREET PINCKNEYVILLE, IL  IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR  SALE TO FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION AS A CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENT.  THE STORAGE AND HANDLING SYSTEM CONSISTS OF 1 STORAGE TANK (30,000  GALLONS), LOADING RISERS, ASSOCIATED PLUMBING AND NURSE TANKS.  ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\n\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE \n    325,000 POUNDS. THIS INCLUDES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT COULD BE STORED IN NURSE\n     TANKS.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n   THIS FACILITY HAS DEVELOPED A WORST-CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO. HOWEVER SINCE THIS IS SECURITY SENSITIVE INFORMATION IT HAS BEEN WITHHELD FROM THIS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AS REQUIRED BY E.P.A. REGULATIONS.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n  THIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH EPA'S ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION RULE AND WITH ALL \nAPPLICABLE STATE CODES AND REGULATIONS.  THIS FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISION OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA,\nK-61.1\",  PUBLISHED BY THE AMERI"
