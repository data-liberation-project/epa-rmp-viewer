This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area.  Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere.  Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance.  Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment.  Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: \r\nThe facility is a nominal 6 acre site, with 4 major structures and a paved shipping / receiving area.  The facility produces pasteurized milk products, packaged juice products, and packaged cultured products for its distributors. The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety performance: and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require. Major equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers and other storage vessels, purgers, and a variety of heat exchanges (evaporators, air handlers, etc.). \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  \r\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance.  The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the ammonia ref"

Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\r\n\r\n  OSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program. \r\n  Ammonia relief containment tank that captures and dilutes any ammonia releases from the safety relief valves.\r\n  Ammonia detection and alarm system.\r\n  Eyewash and safety showers throughout ammonia distribution areas.\r\n  Emergency communication systems.\r\n  Close cooperation with the O' Fallon Fire Department.\r\n  Training Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\r\n  Plant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\r\n  Monthly Safety Meetings.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \r\nThere have been no accidents or injuries related to the ammonia refrigeration system during the past five years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  \r\nThe Facility Emergency Action Plan has been developed in accordance with OSHA 1910.38, and in concert with the O' Fallon, Illinois Fire Department. The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of federal and state agencies.  The plan includes Emergency Response to Anhydrous Ammonia, specifically addressing incidents involving ammonia refrigeration.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: \r\nThe facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas, as well as within the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personnel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response."
