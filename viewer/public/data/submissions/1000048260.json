The facility uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  EDCC maintains an open dialogue with local emergency responders and has provided them with a copy of its Emergency Response Plan, detailing important facility-specific information.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including the following:\n\n\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances exceeding threshold quantities, in a single process, which are regulated by the EPA's RMP Rule;\n\n?    A summary of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical releases;\n\n?    An overview of accidental release prevention programs;\n\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the RMP Rule;\n\n?    An overview of the Emergency Response Program; and\n\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\n3.1  Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n    EDCC's primary activity involves the production of ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid.  These products are used extensively in the agricultural, mining, specialty chemical manufacturing, and forestry products industries.  From a consumer's viewpoint, these products are used in the manufacture of paper, water treatment chemicals, computer chips, and even blue jean dye to name a few applications.  The facility uses or manufactures the following chemicals that EPA has listed on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list, and that are stored above threshold quantities:\n\n\n\nChemical            Process               Storage      Storage           Density        Maximum\n\n "

The facility keeps a maximum quantity of approximately 6,000 lb of 15% bromine chloride on site.  The threshold quantity for bromine is 10,000 lb.\n\nAs this RMP will illustrate, accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts enable the facility to effectively manage any potential hazards posed by these substances.\n\n&#8195;\n\n3.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nEDCC maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  Also, EDCC parallels the RMP Rule by complying with Process Safety Management (PSM) as required by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910 119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at the facility.\n\n\n\n    3.2.1  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nEDCC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\n    3.2.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\n    The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"HAZOP\" and/or the \"what if\" checklist.  These analyses are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals.  Findings"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turn-around.  Operating procedures are regularly reviewed and are readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  In addition, Daily/Shift Safe Work Permits (Procedure No. S-82) are required for any maintenance work completed at EDCC.\n\n\n\n    3.2.4  Training\n\n\n\n    EDCC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided continuously for operator certification.\n\n&#8195;\n\n    3.2.5  Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\n    EDCC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes:\n\n\n\n?    pressure vessels, \n\n?    storage tanks, \n\n?    piping systems, \n\n?    relief and vent systems,\n\n?    emergency shutdown systems,\n\n?    controls, and \n\n?    pumps.  \n\n\n\nTrained maintenance personnel and the facility's mechanical integrity engineer conduct the process maintenance activities.

These controls include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypass system, emergency back-up power, back-up pumps, rupture disks, excess flow devices, and quench systems.  Passive mitigation includes earthen dikes that route spills to neutralization and the wastewater treatment system, a deluge system, water curtains, and enclosures.  pH probes and alarms are located throughout the plant's storm water system to alert staff of accidental spills or releases.\n\n    \n\n3.3.2  Oleum\n\n\n\n    Process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental release of oleum to the environment.  The tank is installed with a vacuum breaker, sumps that pump lost solution back to the process and a scrubber with an induced draft blower to collect all vents and remove any vaporized sulfur trioxide by dissolving it in water to form sulfuric acid.  The sulfuric acid is returned to the process.  A concrete dike surrounds the ta"

The explosion did not result in a chemical release.  On-site impact included total destruction of the DSN plant as well as structural damage to surrounding processes.  Off-site impact included minor structural damage to residences and businesses.  No deaths or injuries resulted from the incident.  Procedures following the explosion were executed in accordance with the emergency response plan. Office of Emergency Services, as well as, emergency medical assistance, local fire departments, and county police department were notified for assistance.  \n\nThe DSN plant will be replaced with a new Nitric Acid Concentration (NACSAC&reg;) plant. The NACSAC&reg; plant will concentrate weak nitric acid (56% - 65% strength) to strong nitric acid (greater than 98% strength) by extracting water from the weak nitric acid with sulfuric acid.  Since the previously used strong acid process, which required the addition of oxygen, will not be reintroduced, the potential for this explosion scenario to be repeated is eliminated.\n\n\n\n    3.4.2  Ammonia\n\n\n\n    During the past five years, EDCC has not had an accidental ammonia release, resulting in on-site or off-site site consequences, including deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation, or sheltering in place.\n\n    \n\n    3.4.3  Oleum\n\n\n\n    During the past five years, EDCC has not had an accidental oleum release resulting in on-site or off-site consequences, including deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation,"

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The Plan includes the following components:\n\n\n\n?    procedures for informing the public and emergency responders of accidental releases,\n\n?    documentation of proper first aid/emergency medical treatment that may be necessary to treat exposure,\n\n?    emergency response procedures,\n\n?    procedures for using, inspecting, testing, and maintaining response equipment,\n\n?    employee training, and\n\n?    response plan review and update procedures.\n\n\n\nCoordination of the Plan with the Union County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is an integral part of the verification process.  \n\n\n\n3.6  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nEDCC is actively promoting public awareness and education programs concerning emergency response through the Union County Local Emergency Planning Committee and Community Advisory Panel.  This education process enhances the public's ability to respond in a given emergency situation.  EDCC continually strives to improve and upgrade operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment, and develop and implement safety improvement projects.  A list of proposed future improvements is as follows:\n\n\n\n?    continue the partnership and education process with local fire departments to ensure fire department personnel are knowledgeable of site specific processes, materials and products and, as necessary, assist them in updating a site specific fire plan;  \n\n?    provide continued EMT training to employees and on-site confined space rescue team; and\n\n?    install card reader entrances;\n\n?    acquire additional security guards "
