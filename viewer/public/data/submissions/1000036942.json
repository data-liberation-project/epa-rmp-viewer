The emergency response policy is to protect employees, local citizens, and the environment by determining the potential for accidental release and providing, where possible, effective mitigation measures, employee training, and responder training and familiarization.  Additionally, the company is committed to review policies and procedures periodically or whenever warranted for cause.\n\nThe stationary source for which this plan is created and maintained is a bulk storage tank containing carbon disulfide.  The equipment employed for the purpose of receiving and storing carbon disulfide prior to use is specifically designed and constructed to eliminate release in any quantity.  Regular inspections are carried out along with required maintenance by employees trained in these operations under controlled conditions using written procedures.\n\nMitigation of potential releases of carbon disulfide was included in the design and construction of equipment used to receive and store carbon disulfide.  Containment, blanketing, fire suppression, pressure, and level control devices are integrated into the systems.\n\nOperations involving receiving and storage of carbon disulfide are conducted using carefully written and critically reviewed operating instructions by employees trained in the safe accomplishment of their assigned tasks.  Periodic refresher training is provided.\n\nThere have been no accidents involving carbon disulfide at this facility within the past five years.\n\nResource Innovations I, LLC has created and maintained a comprehensive Integrated Contingency Plan in order to provide a single document to provide guidance in the event of an accident or release of materials.  This document is reviewed regularly and used for training purposes as well a"
