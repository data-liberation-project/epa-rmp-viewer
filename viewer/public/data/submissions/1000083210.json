The pressure vessels accommodate the receipt of butane and store butane onsite for truck loading and for blending into gasoline which requires compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations as greater than 10,000 lbs are stored onsite.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance at this facility is butane.  The equipment which handles butane includes four pressure vessels and associated piping and equipment.  The pressure vessels and associated piping may contain up to 1,251,104 lbs of butane.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Des Moines Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the company's policy to notify the Polk County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\n\nThe regulated butane storage/blending process in the facility is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility or if they were recommended from the latest PHA and installed prior to the RMP submittal.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, "

As opportunities for improvement associated with the new butane process arise at the Des Moines Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.\n\n"
