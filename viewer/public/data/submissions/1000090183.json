The sole purpose of the Authority's Safety Code is to eliminate unsafe acts and unsafe conditions that cause or could cause bodily injury and/or property damage.  No employee is required to work in conditions that are unsafe or unhealthy.  Each employee has the responsibility to detect unsafe situations and to immediately advise their supervisor of an unsafe situation that is beyond their ability or authority to correct.\n\n\n\nBoth instructions and special safety equipment are provided specifically as it has to do with chlorine handling and delivery in addition to general chemical handling, storage and first aid.\n\n\n\nWestern Berks Water Authority and Chlorine\n\n\n\nChlorine is a very important part of our overall water treatment process and is necessary to insure that the water we produce is free of harmful organisms.  Chlorination of the water occurs at the beginning of the filtration process and again at the end to maintain a residual level in the finished water.  Between the two applications of chlorine, the water is treated with a coagulant to form a precipitate that brings small particles together into larger more readily removed particles.\n\n\n\nFor more information on our treatment process and other information about the Authority, visit our website at http://www.wbwa.org\n\n\n\nIn the course of one year's time, the authority operators deal with approximately sixty to seventy one-ton chlorine cylinders.

Storage inside this double-locked and dedicated room serves to restrict access to cylinders by only authorized personnel.  Additionally, by the cylinders being located indoors, no materials other than chlorine are stored in the room and smoking is prohibited within the confines of the plant.  These conditions serve to virtually eliminate the exposure the cylinders would have to sources of heat and therefore the likelihood of fusible plug failure, much less complete cylinder failure.  A vacuum regulator is attached to the gas discharge valve of the chlorine cylinder for the withdraw of chlorine gas.  The vacuum regulator is basically a spring-loaded diaphram valve that requires a vacuum to be present for the valve to open.  The vacuum is created by the inductor where chlorine gas is metered into a water stream.  The vacuum regulator will close if there is insufficient vacuum as a result of a diminished water supply or a break in the chlorine gas line.  Chlorine gas is conducted through the lines under a vacuum and not under pressure; chlorine gas is under pressure only from the cylinder to the vacuum regulator mounted directly to the cylinder valve.  Maintenance of the vacuum regulators and chlorinators is performed bi-annually by certified representatives of the manufacturer.  Maintenance performed by the plant operators consists of annual replacement of the polyethylene lines connecting the vacuum regulator to the chlorine gas line.\n\n\n\nA Fischer & Porter Chloralert chlorine gas leak detector is located in an adjacent room with the detector located in the cylinder storage room.

The results are those which were prepared using the Safer Systems, Inc. TRACE Version 8 dispersion model as obtained from the Chlorine Institute, Inc. Pamphlet 74, Edition 3, dated April 1998.  The scenario requires that the container be completely compromised, a situation which, as described above, is considered remote.  It is believed that a more likely source of a leak would be from a valve failure of some sort and that is considered as the alternative release scenario.  This scenario was chosen based on the history of the Authority's lack of a chlorine release from its start-up in 1974 through the present time.  The cylinder valve is recognized as the one single component which is operated during each cylinder change operation and which serves as the only control device for chlorine which is under pressure prior to the vacuum regulator.\n\n\n\nWhile the alternative release scenario does not take mitigation into account, the Authority conducts plant familiarization tours with the fire departments that would respond to the facility on the initial alarm.
