Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules, regulations, and requirements.  Safety depends upon the manner which we handle these products combined with the safety devices, policies, and procedures and good engineering design and practices in the operation of the process.  These include aggressive safety programs such as our Basic Safety Process and our Responsible Care Codes of Management Practice.  \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance:\n\nThe stationary source contains the following regulated substances above the EPA RMP TQ:  Arsine, Phosphorus Oxychloride and Titanium Tetrachloride.  Arsine is manufactured under vacuum using a chemical reaction to generate the gas.  The aggregate storage of this product makes RMP applicable.  Phosphorus Oxychloride is purified using distillation technology.   The aggregate storage quantity of material makes this product RMP applicable.  Titanium Tetrachloride is purified using distillation technology.  The aggregate storage quantity makes this product RMP applicable.\n\n3. Clarifications to the Alternate Case Scenario for Arsine include: Quantity released is less than one pound (0.2 pounds). The EPA default value is one pound.  Rate of release is less than 0.1 pound/minute (0.02 pounds/minute). The miniumum EPA value is 0.1 pounds per minute.\n\n4. The general accident release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility complies with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA?s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation.  In addition, the facility implements the American Chemistry Council?s Responsible Care codes of management practice and complies with all local and state specific regulatory requirements.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:\n\nOn July 11 2001, a loss of containment occurred with an in-process Arsine cylinder in which emergency services res"

There are emergency programs and plans specific to the facility and surrounding industry.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility strives toward continuous improvement in regards to EH&S and good engineering practices and design.  The facility implements the American Chemistry Council?s Responsible Care codes of management practices.  In addition to this, Air Products and Chemicals has implemented EH&S Global standards and best practices that often exceed regulatory standards."
