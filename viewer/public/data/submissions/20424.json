As part of this commitment, SENA has established procedures to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facilities.

One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan describing the risk management program at the WR Pulp Mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the risk management plan requirements of the RMP rule.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIn April 1967, Consolidated Papers, Inc. adopted a corporate environmental policy that guides the continuous improvement of its environmental performance as it strives to prevent pollution and achieve the objective of operating facilities with minimal environmental impact.  This policy was updated in November 1996.  On August 31, 2000 Consolidated Papers, Inc. was aquired by Stora Enso, Oyj of Helsinki, Finland. SENA's environmental policy statement is publicly available on the Stora Enso Internet website.  As part of its risk reduction objective, SENA will strive to minimize environmental, health, and safety risks to its employees and the communities in which it operates by employing safe technologies and operating procedures.  SENA will be constantly prepared for emergencies.  SENA will continually inform its employees and public of its progress in safety and environmental issues.  \n\nSENA is one of 26 Wisconsin paper companies voluntarily participating in the Wisconsin Paper Council's Pollution Prevention Partnership with the Wisconsin Department of Natural "

In addition, SENA is a leading manufacturer of coated specialty papers used in consumer product packaging and labeling.  SENA also produces elemental chlorine-free kraft pulp for its own use from virgin wood fiber, and recycled pulp from printed and post-consumer wastepaper.  Other products manufactured by SENA include paperboard and paperboard products.\n\nStora Enso, Oyj. is domiciled in Helsinki, Finland. SENA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Stora Enso, Oyj. is based in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin.  It operates paper and pulp manufacturing facilities in Biron, Kimberly, Appleton, Niagara, Stevens Point, Whiting, and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, as well as in Duluth, Minnesota.  It also operates wastewater treatment plants in Stevens Point, Niagara, Kimberly, and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin to treat wastewater generated by the pulp and paper manufacturing plants.  Wastewater treatment is also done at the facilities in Duluth, Minnesota.\n\nThe WR Pulp Mill is a pulp mill operated by SENA in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin.

      "SummaryText": "making.\n\nThe pulp bleaching process in the manufacture of kraft pulp involves chemically treating the wood pulp fibers to reduce or remove lignin and resin.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Consolidated Papers, Inc. (CPI) took voluntary steps to eliminate the use of elemental chlorine from its pulp-bleaching process by implementing a multi-million dollar multiphase chlorine-elimination program.  In late 1996, CPI eliminated elemental chlorine from their entire kraft (chemical) pulp-bleaching process, thus achieving the commonly referred to position of elemental chlorine-free (ECF).  CPI's mechanical pulps were already being bleached using a totally chlorine-free (TCF) process.\n\nChlorine dioxide and chlorine are the chemicals regulated by the RMP rule that are stored or handled at this facility in total quantities greater than or equal to the threshold quantities.  Chlorine dioxide is generated onsite as a gas under a slight vacuum and absorbed into water.  The chlorine dioxide liquid solution is stored in tanks and is used to bleach pulp.  The chlorine dioxide solution is stored in three vertical aboveground tanks with design capacities of 60,000 gallons, 60,000 gallons, and 103,000 gallons.  The chlorine dioxide solution has a concentration of 1% by weight of chlorine dioxide.  Thus, the total quantity of chlorine dioxide stored at the WR Pulp Mill is 18,609 lb.  The three chlorine dioxide tanks are partially located inside a building. \n \nChlorine is stored in nine aboveground cylinder tanks, each with a design capacity of one ton.  The total quantity of chlorine stored at this facility is 18,000 lb.  The chlorine cylinders are kept inside a building.  Chlorine is a toxic gas liquefied by pressure in the cylinder and is used to treat process water.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nTwo worst-case release scenarios at WR Pulp Mill were analyzed, both involving toxic substances (chlorine dioxide and chlorine.)\n\nT"
