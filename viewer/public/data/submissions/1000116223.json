The steam is used for enhanced oil recovery. Electrical power generated is consumed by Chevron with surplus power sold to the local utility.\nSRCF located in San Ardo, California in the County of Monterey. SRCF operates one natural gas\nfired combustion turbine generator. SRCF is a cogeneration plant that produces electricity and\nsteam which is utilized for enhanced oil recovery. SRCF utilizes Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology to reduce combustion Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) emissions. SCR is a post-combustion flue gas NOx emission control technology that removes NOx from the flue gas downstream from the combustion process. A reducing agent is used to reduce NOx emissions by oxidation-reduction reactions in the presence of a catalyst. Injection of the reducing agent/air mixture into the combustion exhaust stream before the catalyst initiates the reactions and achieves the desired removal of NOx emissions upstream from the stack.\nThe SRCF uses anhydrous ammonia (Chemical Abstracts Service #7664-41-7) as the reagent for the SCR system. The maximum amount stored on site is 1700 gallons this is limited to state regulatory requirements that limit the amount of volume in the vessel to 85% capacity. The site consists of two 1,000-gallon storage vessels for the anhydrous ammonia; however, only a single 1,000-gallon (850-gallon limit or 4,276 lbs) anhydrous ammonia tank is provided to support the SCR at the SRCF. Maintenance and loading of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank have been contracted out. Transport of anhydrous ammonia to SRCF is accomplished using tanker trucks, with individual deliveries of no more than 1700 gallons. Deliveries are scheduled every three to five weeks. The storage tank lies within an enclosed dike and is equipped with a deluge system. The deluge system is"

SRCF incorporates the concepts of environmental responsibility and with safety into all aspects of base operations and public. As part of SRCF's obligation to protect the integrity of humans, environmental, physical, and financial resources, and to conserve and efficiently utilize those resources, SRCF will: comply fully with laws regulating environmental protection and workforce and public health and safety; furnish work places free of recognized hazards likely to cause injury to people and the environment; train employees in safe and environmentally conscious practices and require compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations, policies, and procedures; and provide professional staff to maintain and support environmental, health, and safety programs.\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Salinas River Cogeneration Facility keeps a variety of technical documents utilized to maintain safe operation of the processes.

The covered process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents providing information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure safety features in the process are not compromised.\nA management of change process is in place and is used to document and manage changes within the plant affecting safety and environment, as well as changes which modify the facility or change operating conditions.\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHAs) and Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCAs) assessments are conducted to identify, characterize, and safely manage actual or potential hazards associated with operations. The accidental release prevention strategy is based on the seven elements of the CalARP Program 2 Prevention Program as follows.\n\nHAZARD REVIEW\n\nThe Salinas River Cogeneration Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The HAZOP methodology is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique. The analyses are conducted using a team of people with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as necessary.\nThe HAZOP findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to HAZOP findings is based on risk ranking assigned by the HAZOP team. This ranking ensures the findings associated with the highest risk are prioritized over findings with a lower risk ranking. All approved mitigation options in response to HAZOP team findings are assigned to responsible personnel and tracked to completion.\nTo verify the process control functions still adhere to the design intent, the HAZOP is revalidated every five years.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Salinas River Cogeneration Facility maintains written operating procedures addressing various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) emergency shutdown (4) normal shutdown, and (5) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.
