Fort James has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This \ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training \npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our \nprocesses.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of \nregulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to \ncontrol and contain the release.\n\nThe Fort James Wauna mill plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements.  To accomplish \nthis goal, the management systems at Wauna have been developed in such a way that the hazards \nare identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  The RMP-regulated chemicals at \nthe Wauna mill are limited to chlorine dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ammonia.  \n\nES.2  DESCRIPTION OF WAUNA MILL AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nMill Description\n\nThe Fort James Wauna Mill is located on 1200 acres adjacent to the Columbia River in Clatsop \nCounty, Oregon.  This site was originally developed in 1909 for a lumber mill operation. The \nWauna mill began its current business of producing pulp and paper in 1965. \n\nThe Wauna mill is a fully integrated pulp and paper mill that uses the following general \nprocesses: The Mill produces a variety of paper products.  These products include towel and \ntissue products for retail stores and the commercial market, uncoated printing papers, as well as \nnewsprint and other groundwood specialty paper grades. The Wauna mill employs about 1,100 \npeople from the local area."

      "SummaryText": "Logs, sawdust, wood chips, and purchased pulp are transported to the mill by barge or by truck. \nLogs are reduced to chips on site. Sawdust and wood chips are stored in piles prior to processing.\n\nWauna uses the kraft process as well as a groundwood process to convert wood into pulp.  In the \ngroundwood pulping process, pulp is produced by mechanically grinding wood chips in \nmachines called refiners.  Groundwood pulp is bleached with sodium hydrosulfite and/or a \nsolution of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide. \n\nThe kraft process uses a sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide solution under heat and pressure \nto dissolve the lignin component of wood. The dissolved lignin and spent pulping chemicals are \nseparated from unbleached pulp by washers and sent to chemical recovery. After washing, \nunbleached pulp goes through a multi-stage bleach plant. The bleaching process uses sodium \nhydroxide, oxygen,  chlorine dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide to remove residual lignin from the \npulp and whiten it to commercial brightness levels. The chlorine dioxide solution is produced on-\nsite from sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, methanol, and water.\n\nThere are five papermachines at the Wauna mill.  Three of the papermachines produce towel and \ntissue grades, one produces white printing papers, and one produces groundwood specialty \npapers and newsprint. \n\nBleached pulps derived from different wood species as well as purchased pulp and secondary \nfiber recycled from waste paper are blended to produce a mixture tailor-made for each paper \ngrade.  The rolls of paper from the towel and tissue papermachines are converted on-site into \nnapkins, towels, bathroom tissue, or facial tissue. Rolls of paper from the communication \npapermachines are wrapped and sold directly to printers and converters.  The mill also operates a \npulp dryer which produces baled pulp for internal use or sale to outside customers.\n\nWastewaters from the mill are collected and pumped to an air activated biological"

Therefore not everyone \nwithin the calculated zone would be at risk for any given release.  \n\n  ES6.2  Wind Speed and Surface Roughness Used to Model Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nEPA's guidance for offsite consequence modeling suggests that typical meteorological data \nfrom a local meteorological station should be used to define the wind speed and atmospheric \nstability for the modeling of alternate release scenarios.   The guidance suggests that a wind \nspeed of 3.0 meters per second should be considered for the Alternate Release scenarios,  unless \nthe facility has data to support a different wind speed.  For the ARPP, Fort James reviewed PSD-\nquality meteorological data that were collected at the Wauna mill  in 1992-1993, and determined \nthat a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second is a reasonable worst condition estimate. \n\nThe downwind dispersion of a hypothetical dense-gas plume also depends on the assumed \nsurface roughness. For the RMP*Comp model, a choice of Urban versus Rural surroundings \nneeded to be made.  The surface roughness around the Wauna facility varies considerably \ndepending on the land use, vegetation,  and topography.  The local land use in the area \nimmediately north of the mill consists of open water and grassland along the Columbia River. \nHowever, the regional land use within a 5-mile radius of the Wauna mill consists mainly of \ndense coniferous forest and large hills which would create significant resistance to the movement \nof a gas cloud. Due to the proximity to the open water, a rural setting was chosen for the \ncalculations and represents the worse conditions for a release.\n\nBased on these assessments of wind speed and surface roughness,  Fort James conducted the \ndispersion modeling using the following assumed conditions:\n\nReasonable Conservative Conditions\nWind speed = 3.0 meters per second\nAtmospheric stability = D\nTopography:  Rural Surroundings\n\n  ES"

      "SummaryText": "6.3  Alternate Release Scenario:  Chlorine Dioxide Aqueous Solution\n\nChlorine dioxide (ClO2) is used as a bleaching agent.  It is manufactured at the Wauna mill, and \nis stored as a dilute aqueous solution in large, above-ground storage tanks.  The Alternate \nRelease Scenario release event for the chlorine dioxide storage system assumes that a truck \naccident shears off a 4-inch valve at the largest ClO2 storage tank, and it takes 30 minutes to \nplug the broken valve.  The tank has a capacity of 54,500 gallons, and stores chilled aqueous \nClO2 solution at a typical temperature of 40 deg. F and a typical storage concentration of 1%.  \nBased on equations from EPA's Offsite Consequence Modeling Guidance, the calculated liquid \nflow rate from the 4-inch pipe is 1,200 gpm.  A total of 36,000 gallons of dilute solution, \ncontaining  3,300 pounds of ClO2, would be spilled from the tank during the hypothetical 30-\nminute accident.\n\nThe ClO2 storage tanks are located in an area that is well designed to mitigate a large release.  \nMuch of the  liquid that might be spilled would be captured by the containment curb that \nsurrounds the tanks.  Spilled liquid contained in that area would quickly drain into the mill's \nprocess sewer.  Any spilled ClO2 solution that fell outside the containment curb would quickly \nflow into nearby sewer drains into the process sewer within seconds or minutes after the release.  \nThe mill's process wastewater contains routine organic and inorganic compounds that constitute \nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD).  COD in the wastewater would quickly react with spilled \nClO2, and would therefore reduce the potential for the ClO2 to volatilize to the atmosphere.\n\nAs part of this ARPP emission estimate, Fort James staff conducted laboratory tests to confirm \nthat the ClO2 in the spilled solution would react quickly with COD in the process  wastewater \nstream.  The tests confirmed the ClO2 was depleted within seconds after mixing with \nwastewater.  Therefore, the"

Only the amount \nof ClO2 that exceeded the mass of available COD would have the potential to volatilize to the \natmosphere.\n\nThe ClO2 emission rates from each of the following volatilization points were calculated using \nEPA's WATER8 model:\n\n* Spill from broken pipe fitting onto the ground.\n* Overland flow to sewer drains.\n* Volatilization within the 2,500 foot long sewer.\n* Bar screen and pump station.\n* Primary clarifier.\n\nThe WATER8 model predicted that only a small fraction of the ClO2 in the spilled solution \nwould volatilize in the sewer, pump station, and wastewater plant. Only about half of the ClO2 \nthat spills from the storage tank was modeled to volatilize, while the remainder was modeled to \ndeplete by reaction with compounds in the wastewater plant.  WATER8 calculated that a total of \n1,650 pounds of ClO2 would volatilize to the atmosphere during the 30-minute spill and the 10-\nminute period it would take for the spilled solution to flow into the sewer.\n\nBased on the preceding information, the SLAB dispersion model was used to estimate the \ndownwind distance to EPA's toxic endpoint concentration of 1.0 ppm for ClO2.  The distance \ncalculated by this model is 1.5 miles.  \n\nThis scenario was also modeled using the EPA RMP*Comp model.  In EPA's model, it is \nassumed that all of the ClO2 is in a gaseous vapor rather than a water solution, and all of this \nmaterial is disbursed into the air.   Therefore the results of the calculations using a total of 3,300 \nlbs. of ClO2 released over a 30 minute period shows a larger estimated downwind distance to \nEPA's toxic endpoint concentration than that calculated using SLAB.  This model estimates an \nimpact distance of 2.2 miles.

The emergency procedures at the \nWauna Mill resulted in an effective response such that the release was quickly controlled and \ncontained, and no off-site impacts occurred.\n\nES.5  SUMMARY OF SAFETY FEATURES AT REGULATED PROCESSES \n\nThe processes at the mill have been designed to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  \nSection 7 of the Risk Management Plan includes checklists that itemize the monitoring methods \nand mitigations at each RMP-regulated process.  Table ES-2 briefly summarizes the key safety \nfeatures for each of the processes regulated under the ARPP. \n\nES.6  MODELING OF OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCES OF HYPOTHETICAL ACCIDENTAL \nRELEASES\n\nThis section describes the offsite consequence modeling to predict the downwind distance to the \ntoxic endpoint concentrations as defined by EPA's ARPP regulations.  Modeling was done using \nboth the EPA's RMP*Comp model as well as SLAB, which is a more sophisticated mathematical \nmodel used in industry.  The calculated distance for the Administrative Worst-Case Release was \ngreater from the EPA model than from SLAB.  The result from the EPA model was chosen for \nreporting purposes as it represents the greatest potential impact, and therefore is the most \nconservative result for emergency planning purposes.  \n\n  ES6.1  Administrative Worst-Case Release for Toxic Compound (Chlorine Dioxide)\n\nThe administrative worst-case release (WCS) at the Wauna mill is a hypothetical release of the \nentire contents of the largest storage tank containing 54,500 gallons of 1.1% aqueous chlorine \ndioxide solution. In accordance with the RMP regulations, the entire contents of the tank (54,500 \ngallons of dilute aqueous solution containing 5,000 lbs. of ClO2) was assumed to spill onto the \nground in 10 minutes, resulting in the evaporation of a gas cloud in 10 minutes.

The \nmandated meteorological conditions for the WCS are 1.5 mps wind speed and F stability.  The \nsurface roughness was assumed to be 0.5 meters,  based on the regional land use consisting of \ndense coniferous forest with some grassland and open water.  The SLAB model \ncalculated an endpoint of 12.6 miles. Whereas the EPA model calculated the \nendpoint to be 14 miles. As listed in the checklists under Section 2.12 of this RMP, the Landview \nII database indicates a population of approximately 11,000 residents within the 14 mile radius.  \nPotential environmental receptors are the Lewis and Clark National Wildlife Refuge, Julia Butler \nHansen Wildlife Refuge, Beaver Creek Fish Hatchery, and Elkomin Fish Hatchery.  The \nColumbia River is used for both recreational activities and commercial traffic.  Oregon State \nHighway 30 is a primary traffic route between Longview, WA and Astoria, OR.\n\nThe estimated population of 11,000 residents that might be affected by such a hypothetical release \nis conservatively high .  Even if an entire storage tank were somehow to be released during the \nworst-case atmospheric conditions, the steep terrain in the region would probably prevent the \nresulting chlorine dioxide cloud from migrating anywhere other than along the river valley.  \nUnder F stability conditions, light winds would not be able to transport the dense chlorine \ndioxide cloud to a height of more than about 400 feet above the release.  As a result, receptors \nsituated at elevations  more than about 400 feet higher than the Wauna mill would probably not \nbe impacted under EPA's stipulated worst case weather conditions.  It is reasonable to assume \nthat only the low-lying areas along the Columbia River could be impacted.  Also, a gas"

A summary of the RMP-regulated processes and substances is given below.  \n\nChlorine Dioxide Generator and Associated Chlorine Dioxide Storage. An R8 process is used to \ngenerate chlorine dioxide on-site for subsequent use in the kraft bleach plant.  In this process, \nmethanol is added to a heated solution of sodium chlorate and sulfuric acid in a reaction vessel \nwhich is under a vacuum.  The resultant chlorine dioxide gas is absorbed in cold water and then \nstored as a nominal 1% solution.  The actual chlorine dioxide solution strength can range as high \nas 1.1%.  \n\nSulfurous Acid Manufacturing.  Dilute aqueous sulfurous acid is manufactured on-site for use in \nthe Kraft and groundwood bleaching processes.  Sulfur dioxide is purchased and stored on-site \nas a liquid in 1,000 gallon storage cylinders.  Sulfur dioxide from these cylinders is added to cold \nwater to produce, as needed, a 3% solution of sulfurous acid which is used to decompose small \namounts of chlorine dioxide or peroxide bleaching chemicals which may remain with the pulp at \nthe end of the groundwood or kraft bleaching processes.\n\nFluid Bed Boiler NOx Control and Associated Ammonia Storage.

Fort James rigorously maintains all of the equipment at the mill, and considers any \nmajor accident at these processes to be highly unlikely.  As described in Section ES-7, the \nWauna mill's emergency response procedures address potential releases of these chemicals.\n\nPropane - Small tanks of propane are used at various locations at the mill.
