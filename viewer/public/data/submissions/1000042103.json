This process consists of up to three ammonia railcars on a single siting, decoupled from the switch engine, and awaiting spotting and hookup for unloading.  A total of six leased railcars are dedicated to this service with a maximum of three full cars allowed within the Pontchartrain stationary source at anytime. Some prevention programs are shared with other processes on the stationary source.  No modification to the railcars is preformed on the stationary source and, therefore, some aspects of the prevention program do not apply to this pseudo process.

At the Pontchartrain Site, the policies are implemented through the Pontchartrain Site Process Management Manual (PMM).  This manual is available to all employees through hard copies and also through on-line computer networks. In addition, the Pontchartrain Site Emergency Manual lays out the complete Emergency Response program for the site.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe DuPont Pontchartrain Site consists of 1132 acres, located in St John the Baptist Parish between the unincorporated areas of LaPlace and Reserve.  About 200 acres of the property are used for manufacturing areas, 590 acres are leased for cattle grazing, 30 acres are leased for recreation, and the remainder is set aside for wildlife habitat and future manufacturing needs.  A portion of the area used for manufacturing is occupied by DuPont Performance Polymers.  The DuPont Performance Polymers facilities are considered to be a separate \"stationary source\" for the purposes of 40 CFR part 68.\n\n\n\nIn and prior to 2010, the DuPont Pontchartrain Site consisted of two manufacturing processes:  \n\n\n\n*  Paraphenylene Diamine\n\n*  Isophorone Diamine\n\n\n\nThe Isophorone Diamine Unit was cleared of process material and shutdown on 10/7/2010.  There are not any plans to start this unit again and the air permit was not re-newed, therefore as part of this RMP submittal the Isophorone Diamine Process has been removed from the RMP.   \n\n\n\nIn the production of these product"
