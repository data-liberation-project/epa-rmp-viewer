INTRODUCTION\n\n  The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for\n  the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP).  The RMP is in accordance with the requirements set\n  forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The PGDP plant is subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP\n  requirements.\n\n\n2.   MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION\n\n  USEC is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of the\n  workers and the public, and protects the environment.  In order to meet these commitments, USEC\n  has issued an operations policy manual which states, in part:\n\n     USEC is ultimately responsible for, and is committed to, safe operations,  maintenance, design,\n     fabrication, and testing of the . . . Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant . . . and is committed to\n     conducting operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of workers and the public,\n     protects the environment, and provides for the common defense and security.\n\n  Program and staff organizations are established for safety, safeguards and quality, and environmental,\n  safety, and health with sufficient resources to support the line organization in safe operation of the\n  plant.\n\n\n3.   GENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\n\n3.1  Facility Description\n\n  PGDP enriches uranium using the gaseous diffusion process.  PGDP is located on a 3,425-acre site,\n  of which 748 acres are within the controlled plant security fence.  The entire facility is owned by the\n  United States Department of Energy (DOE).\n\n  USEC leases and operates a  portion of the plant. The portion of PGDP leased by USEC contains\n  more than 115 buildings with a total floor space of about 8 million square feet.  Four large enrichment\n  process buildings constitute approximately 75 percent of the plants' total floor space.  There are also\n  cooling towers, electrical switchyards, and"

Chlorine is managed in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119\n  PSM program.\n\n3.3  Use of Regulated Substances\n\n  Raw water is taken from the Ohio River, treated and supplied to PGDP for numerous uses.  A portion\n  of the water is filtered and post-disinfected, using chlorine, and used to supply potable water, fire\n  system water, cooling water, and other uses.  Raw water treatment takes place at the C-611 Water\n  Treatment Plant which is located to the west of the plant.  Chlorine is used at two locations at C-611. \n  One location has two containers with one container connected to the manifold system, and one\n  location with four containers of which two are connected to the manifold system at any time.\n\n  A portion of the water treated at C-611 is provided to the recirculating cooling water (RCW) system. \n  This system provides cooling water to the enrichment process.  RCW is treated with chlorine, via\n  chlorinators in four RCW pump houses,  to control the growth of microorganisms in the RCW system. \n   Two pump houses have two 1-ton containers with one container connected to the manifold system,\n  and two pump houses have four 1-ton containers of which two are connected to the manifold system\n  at any time.\n\n  Chlorine is also stored in 1-ton containers at a storage yard near the western boundary of the fenced\n  area and at a storage yard near the C-611 facility. \n\n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "ENT SCENARIOS\n\n\n4.1  Worst-Case Scenarios\n\n  Chlorine is used at the site water treatment plant and the four RCW pump houses.  At the water\n  treatment plant and two of the pump houses, two 1-ton containers are connected to the chlorination\n  system.  The worst-case scenarios involve the release of the total contents of both containers (4,000\n  pounds).\n\n  The toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario, determined using RMPComp, was\n  approximately 3 miles.  Within this 3-mile radius are included private residences, small businesses, \n  an electric power generating plant, schools, churches, and a state wildlife management area.\n\n  At two of the pump houses, only one 1-ton container is connected to the chlorinator at any time.  In\n  the cylinder storage yard the release scenario assumed a single container failure.  Therefore, the\n  release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine from one of  the three locations with two connected containers\n  constitutes the worst-case scenario.\n\n4.2  Alternative Scenarios\n  \n  The alternative scenario involved the release of the contents of two containers (4000 pounds),\n  assuming a connecting hose failure.  The toxic endpoint for this case, determined using the ALOHA\n  program, was approximately 1.4 miles.  Within this radius are included private residences, churches,\n  small businesses, and a portion of a state wildlife management area.  \n\n\n5.   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n  There have been no major releases of chlorine involving injury to site workers,  environmental effects,\n  or any impact to the public within the past five years.  Chlorine releases have been limited to small\n  leaks from manifolds and manifold connections.\n\n\n6.   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n  Chemical safety at PGDP consists of the integration of environmental, safety, and health management\n  systems to address chemical safety.  Chemical safety controls are designed to mitigate the adverse\n  affects of the toxic materials used in the enrichment process"
