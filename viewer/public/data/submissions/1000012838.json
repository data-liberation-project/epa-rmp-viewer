      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Wyaconda Retail Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68.  Helena engages in the formulation, distribution, and sale of chemicals to customers, most of whom use HelenaA?s products to support agricultural operations.  As related to this program, the Wyaconda Facility conducts retail operations and is exempt from the OSHA standards 29 CFR A? 1910.119.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR A? 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by the Facility.\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the retail operation that is located approximately 1.2 miles north of 121 E. Jefferson, Wyaconda, MO 63474 off of State Highway A.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Wyaconda Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Wyaconda Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena has updated this RMP and is resubmitting it as a 5-Year update.  As part of the update, Helena updated the off-site consequence analysis for the worst case scenario and alternative case scenarios.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Wyaconda Facility operations Office is located at 121 E. Jefferson, Wyaconda, MO 63474.  However, the Wyaconda Retail Facility covered process is located approximately 1.2 miles north of 121 E. Jefferson, Wyaconda, MO 63474 off of State Highway A.  At the covered process, Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a 10,000- gallon commercial truck and then "

      "SummaryText": "transferred to a single (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank.  The commercial truck operator performs the transfer.  Helena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the storage tank and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks.  Once the nurse tanks are filled, they are transported 1.2 miles south to the Wyaconda facility operations office where the customer then takes the nurse tank.  The Wyaconda Retail Facility stores a total of eleven (11) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, five (5) of which are dedicated to the retail operations.  The other six (6) nurse tanks are dedicated for use in fertilizer blending operations that are conducted at 121 E. Jefferson.  Helena performs all storage, filling, and transfer operations in accordance with the Prevention Program 2 Program that is incorporated into the RMPr.  Although the blending operations fall below the RMP threshold of anhydrous ammonia and therefore is not subject to 40 CFR Part 68, Helena has included the blending operations in its RMPr.   \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the ammonia storage and filling process. The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 2-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are "

      "SummaryText": "overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since excess flow valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the severed transfer line.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Fertilizer Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program 2 Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelenaA?s Wyaconda Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Wyaconda Facility.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Wyaconda Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Wyaconda Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Clark County LEPC.\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPAA?s RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Wyaconda Facility.\n"
