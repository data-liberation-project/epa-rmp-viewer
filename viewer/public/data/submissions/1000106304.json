Contractors are made aware of the potential dangers involved with a system covered by PSM/RMP. Procedures are in place to make sure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, and (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency prior to their beginning work. Periodically contractors are evaluated to ensure that both their safety performance and training required for work on the hydrogen purification process. CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS Air Liquide's accidental release prevention program activities helps prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. The following are examples of the types of safety features in place: \u00b7 Personal/portable ambient air monitors \u00b7 Release Mitigation \u00b7 PSV \u00b7 Flare \u00b7 Fire water monitors \u00b7 Special personal protective equipment (e.g., FRC protective clothing,) \u00b7 Automatic control and manual valves that provide for isolation of the process equipment FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY The Bayport SMR has no accidents resulting in catastrophic consequence onsite or offsite in the past 5 years. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION The Air Liquide Bayport Complex maintains a written emergency action plan (EAP) which includes the Bayport SMR. The Bayport Complex EAP is reviewed and trained on annually. The Bayport SMR employees are trained to first responder awareness level to be ready in the event of accidental releases of a regulated substance. The EAP provides details for the safe evacuation of facility personnel, contractors and visitors. The EAP describes coordination with Pasadena Fire Department and other emergency response groups. The EAP plan contains the outside agency notification process and information on emerg"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. Resolutions to the recommendations are documented, tracked and closed. Incident Investigation Air Liquide defines management systems and establishes the requirements for communicating, investigating and reporting of incidents at all facilities through the use of an Incident Investigation and reporting procedure. Air Liquide documents incident and subsequent investigation, follow up actions, and closure. Results of findings and corrective actions are shared with employees who could be affected by the findings. Employee Participation At the Bayport SMR, employees are expected to participate in the accidental release prevention program (PSM/RMP). Employees are trained on and are provided access to the hydrogen process safety information. The specific ways an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan. Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation. participating in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are correct and recommend any necessary changes. Safe & Hot Work Permit System Air Liquide has a safe & hot work permit system in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. The MI program assists with the verification and suitability of new and existing process equipment and, as well as quality control of spare parts and modifications to existing process equipment. Management of Change Air Liquide's management of change (MOC) procedure has established the requirements for ensuring that proposed process or equipment changes or changes indirectly affecting processes are evaluated, approved, and documented prior to implementation through the use of a management of change process. The MOC procedure outlines the requirements for documenting, evaluating the impact, and approving planned changes All MOC's are submitted, reviewed by subject matter experts(such as Engineering, Risk Management, Operations, Health and Safety), approved, tracked, and closed. Personnel whose assigned job functions are impacted by the MOC, are briefed and /or trained in the MOC requirements. Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) Air Liquide ensures the safety of new/modified facilities or processes before placing those facilities or processes into service through the use of pre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs).

The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards. The PHA team will review findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Air Liquide action item tracking system. Operating Procedures Air Liquide maintains written procedures that address various modes of hydrogen purification process operations, such as (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal and temporary operations; (3) unit shutdown; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) startup following an emergency shutdown; and (6) process deviation, consequence and action. These procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. Training Air Liquide has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the hydrogen purification process. All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topics as: general orientation, site rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response.

(Air Liquide) Bayport steam methane reforming (Bayport SMR) process is located within the Air Liquide Bayport complex in Pasadena, Texas. The Bayport SMR process involves the reforming of natural gas feedstock into pure hydrogen. Bayport SMR is considered the covered process, as defined under the accidental release prevention regulations, as a flammable mixture process having in excess of 10,000 pounds. Regulated Chemical The SMR process is designed to provide an efficient production of high purity hydrogen product using natural gas feedstock. Purified hydrogen is sold to Industrial customer(s). The Bayport Hydrogen Plant also produces steam, sold directly to nearby industrial customers. The Bayport SMR is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS Air Liquide's Bayport SMR is covered by EPA's accidental release prevention program regulations and is subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard. The Bayport SMR process is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment. The flammability of the process makes it necessary to put in place safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community. Air Liquide's policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The summary below discusses the process safety system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program. Process Safety Information (PSI) Air Liquide keeps a variety of technical documents onsite electronically that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation"
