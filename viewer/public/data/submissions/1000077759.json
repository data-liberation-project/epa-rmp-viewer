      "SummaryText": "The Hermiston Generating Plant (HGP) is owned by Hermiston Generating Company, L.P. and is located at 78145 Westland Road, Hermiston, Oregon 97838.\n\n\n\nThe plant's overall approach to chemical safety and security involves safe equipment design, well-trained employees, qualified contractors, and regular audits and assessments.  The HGP operates an electric and steam generating facility.  Natural gas is used to produce steam through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG).  The steam from the HRSG is used to turn two steam turbines.  Generators are attached to both the combustion and steam turbines which generate electricity.  The HGP stores an aqueous ammonia solution of 29 percent (%), which is used in the air pollution control system to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide.\n\n\n\nThe HGP complies with the RMP regulations and the general accidental release prevention program is incorporated into overall safe plant operation.  The plant is continuously staffed, has perimeter fencing, and controlled access/gate security.  The control room operators have access to real-time process monitoring data for the entire plant, and can take emergency action remotely (e.g., through remote shut-off valves).  Trained operators perform regular visual inspections of equipment and have been properly trained to respond to an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nThe HGP has taken several chemical-specific prevention steps to avert any accidental releases of aqueous ammonia.  The most likely scenario for accidental release is during the offloading of aqueous ammonia.  The HGP accepts approximately one 8,000-pound delivery of aqueous ammonia every 1-2 weeks.  In order to minimize the threat of a release during offloading, the Lead Operator and Maintenance Technician (Lead O&M Tech) conducts pre-job briefings prior to each offloading of aqueous ammonia where the offloading procedure is reviewed with the outside operator and driver prior to offloading.  During the offloading, the outside operator and truck driver"

      "SummaryText": " are stationed at the offloading area, with appropriate personal protection equipment.  The Lead O&M Tech operators remotely monitor the status of the ammonia system.  Any release of ammonia would activate the procedure to immediately halt the offloading procedure.  An emergency shower is located next to the aqueous ammonia tank in the event of an incident.  If normal operations pose a threat of release during offloading, the HGP ammonia system is equipped with several alarms associated with the ammonia process, including loss of dilution air and excess ammonia flow alarms.  In the event that an alarm is activated in the control room, trained operators will take immediate action to correct the problem.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system undergoes preventative maintenance and inspection, including daily rounds in the area of the storage tank and ammonia skid, monthly tank and offload area inspection, and 10-year ultra-sonic testing of the ammonia piping.  The ammonia storage is located inside an 8-foot tall secondary containment structure (dike) and, in the event of a catastrophic release, this structure would prevent the spread of aqueous ammonia and slow the evaporation rate.  There is also a containment berm in the offloading area to contain the truck and its contents during the offloading procedure.\n\nSince the HGP began operation in 1996, the facility has had no spills and no accidents involving aqueous ammonia and the covered process.\n\n\n\nThe HGP has submitted an Emergency Response Plan to the Hermiston Fire Department, which is also the East Oregon Hazardous Material Team.  Plant workers undergo annual Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response training.  A Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) was established in Umatilla County in 2009.  The HGP is a member of the LEPC, which will enhance the plant's ability to respond to chemical releases.\n\n"
