The accidental release prevention policy at the Greater\nGreensburg Sewage Authority??A?s wastewater treatment facility involves a\ncombined effort between management, operating and local emergency\npersonnel.  The facility has an ongoing effort to identify hazards,\nreview safety techniques, and implement employee training through\noperation, maintenance and inspection procedures to manage the risk\nof a chlorine gas release.\n\nB.    The Greater Greensburg Sewage Authority??A?s, wastewater treatment\nfacility was originally placed into operation in 1965.  The facility\nwas expanded in 1992.  The facility currently has the capacity of\ntreating 6.75 million gallons per day of wastewater.  Gaseous\nchlorine, which is stored in a separate room, is utilized to disinfect\nthe effluent prior to discharging to the receiving water.  The amount\nof chlorine handled is two-ton containers for a total of 4,000 pounds.\nThe chlorine gas feeders are wall-mounted and are designed for conveying\nthe gas under vacuum.  The chlorine system is inspected daily by the\nwastewater treatment plant operating personnel.  The facility is\nmanned 8 hours per day.\n\nC.    In general, the Greater Greensburg Treatment Facility??A?s accidental\nrelease prevention program is based on the following:\n\n    - Compilation of safety information for chlorine storage\n    - Review of potential on-site hazards of the chlorine process\n    - Preparation of written operating procedures for safely\n      conducting any activity involving the chlorination process\n    - Implementation of employee training program\n    - Preparation of written maintenance and inspection techniques\n      and schedule for safe operation of the chlorine system\n\nAs an integral part of the prevention program, the Greater Greensburg\nSewage Authority will perform a compliance audit at least once every 3\nyears.  The compliance audit will include a review of all aspects of\nthe "

Written documentation of the audit will be\nmaintained at the administrative offices.\n\nAny incident that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic\nrelease of chlorine will be investigated immediately.  A summary of the\ninvestigation and corrective actions will be documented and maintained\nat the treatment facility.\n\nChemical-specific prevention measures include the facility having the\nappropriate safety equipment on-site including a chlorine detection\ndevice, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and a ton-cylinder repair\nkit.  The facility promotes training and educating the employees relative\nto acceptable operating and handling techniques of chlorine gas.\n\nD.    No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility\nin the past five years.\n\nE.    The facility is included under the Local Emergency Planning\nCommittee (LEPC) of Westmoreland County??A?s written emergency response\nplan.  Release response procedures by all involved parties, evacuation\nprocedures, and training exercises are included within the plan.  The\npublic is to be notified by the County Emergency Management Agency as soon\nas a release occurs.  Evacuation route has been mapped within the plan.\nThe plan is reviewed/updated annually by the facility emergency coordinator.\n\nThe Greater Greensburg Wastewter Treatment Plant employees will not respond\nto accidental releases of chlorine gas.  Emergency responders will include\nthe local fire department, police department, emergency medical service\nand HAZMAT team.\n\nF.    There are no actions planned to improve safety regarding the\nchlorine system at this time.\n"
