The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(1). The Prevention Elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) System prepared in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and State requirements. The disinfection process at the Ponce RWWTP uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, PROSHO, and EQB. Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Ponce RWWTP observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine. The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Ponce RWWTP and the immediate surrounding areas. Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release as well as a written emergency program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Ponce RWWTP outfall terminates in a high-rate diffuser located in the Caribbean Sea that discharges into the Caribbean Sea. Chlorine is used to treat the water in order to disinfec and eliminate objectionable odors.\r\n\r\nChlorine containers (1ton and 150 pounds) are delivered to the facility via truck. From the San Juan Chlorine Distribution Center and Warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine of 1 ton chlorine containers is 60,000 pounds. Chlorine containers are connected to vacuum chlorinators, those regulates the vacuum and the chlorine flow through the system.\r\n\r\nAlso, at the facility there is a Chlorine Distribution Center.  The 150 pounds cylinders stored at the facility are distributed to facilitie"

      "SummaryText": "s in the Ponce Area.  The maximum inventory at the site are 275 cylinders of 150 pounds each for a total of 41,250 pounds of chlorine.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program is composed of many elements and its objective is to prevent accidents and protect the human health, the environment and the property.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nPRASA has an emergency response program. Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warning of any leak. Leak repair kits are maintained on site, and operators are trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur. The emergency response program is coordinated with the local Emergency Response Agency (EQB) for notification of the public. PRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training. \r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPRASA uses Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety; issues identified from a PHA are then addressed in PRASA's Prevention Program. \r\n\r\nAudits\r\n\r\nThe last audit was conducted on August 18, 2016."
