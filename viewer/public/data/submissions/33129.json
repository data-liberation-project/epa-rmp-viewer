This Risk Management Plan has been developed and updated to identify and document the hazards associated with the storage, handling, and possible release of toxic chlorine gas.  The Water Board receives delivery of approximately 10 1-ton chlorine cylinders every four to five months, and as many as 13 1-ton containers may be stored within the Pony Creek Treatment Plant at any one time.  The EPA threshold quantity for gaseous chlorine applicable to the RMP regulations is 2,500 lbs.  The PCTP exceeds this threshold quantity.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from a Water Board chorine process within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nAn off-site consequences analysis was reviewed for a single worst case chlorine gas release scenario and a single alternative chlorine gas release scenario.  The review concluded that the scenerios remain unchanged from the original RMP submitted in June 1999.  The areas affected by such releases are shown on Figures 1 and 2.  For the worst case scenario, a chlorine toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm chlorine may develop within a 2.63 mile radius of the PCTP.  Public receptors within the impacted area include schools, residences, a hospital, medical centers, public recreational areas including parks, pools, and sports fields, and major commercial, office, and industrial areas buildings.  The affected population for the worst case scenario is estimated at 21,500.\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, a chlorine toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm chlorine may develop within a 0.73 mile radius of the PCTP.  Public receptors within the impacted area include schools, residences, a hospital, medical centers, and some commercial and office bu"

The affected population for the alternative release scenario is estimated at 1,300.\n\nThe prevention program includes the chapter on process hazard analysis for the treatment plant chlorination system from the Water Board?s safety manual as well as a supplementary process hazard analysis developed for this RMP.  In addition, a training policy for outside contractors and Water Board employees other than treatment plant operators is included, as well as a 1-ton chlorine cylinder change procedure.  All required prevention program elements are addressed in this section. \n\nThe Coos Bay ? North Bend Water Board has coordinated with the City of Coos Bay Fire Department for response to a chlorine gas release at the PCTP.  The fire department will respond as the Fire and Rescue Hazmat Team.  The primary document describing the response procedures for a chlorine gas release incident as well as any Water Board hazardous material incident is the Coos Bay ? North Bend Water Board Hazardous Materials Annex.  Also, the Water Board?s specific response to a chlorine gas release is described."
