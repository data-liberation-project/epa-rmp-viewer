The Facility Policy\n\n           The owners, management and employees of New Sharon, Iowa are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n           The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers and propane sales and delivery.\n           Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. Propane gas is received, stored and distributed for delivery for home heating, farm and commercial business uses.\n           The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 313,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n           The maximum quantity of propane gas would be 110,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n           a. The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\n           The worst case release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 30,000 gallon tank when filled to 85 p"

According the EPA lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint is .43 miles.\n\n           b. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia, a 1-inch transfer hose is used as a an alternate release scenario followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or a remote manuel shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quatity release would be 2,900 lbs.  The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .3 miles (the most likely potential incident from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia would be a matter of seconds.\n\n            The alternative release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85 percent of capacity (110,000 pounds) resulting in two-thirds of a vapor cloud explosion, causing 1 psi overpressure. (factor .67 x .43) =.29 miles. According the EPA lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint is .29 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n            The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the facility's release prevention program.                                                                                                                                                              (1) Safety information:  the facility was designed and constructed in accordandce with applicable Federal and State of Iowa regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained ath the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  MSDS sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the NH3 equipment are maintained at thefacility                                                                                                                                                             \n(2)  Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews or the hazards associated with the handling and storage of NH3.  The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors the could cause and accidental release, the safeguards to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.                                                                                                       (3)  Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of NH3.  The procedures gennerally follow the provisions of OSHA standard, 29 CFR1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of NH3\" and the ANSI standard, \"Safety Requirements for the storage and Handling of NH3, K-61.1.  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.     "

Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction(e.g. reading safety information, operating procedure and response followed by a written test.)  and on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employess is condusted once a year.  The training program is reviewed by facility management and revised as necessary.

The Five-year Accident History.\n\n             a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that:\n                 have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility:  nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injures, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.   The emergency response program: In the event of an emergency, it is the facility protocol to notify the local fire department and othe emergency responders and request they respond to the emergency.  Facility employeeswill not respond to accidental releases of NH3 except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area(e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate sfety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed ender the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.\n\n                 the facility has:\na.
