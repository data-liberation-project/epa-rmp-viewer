K2 Pure Solutions is committed to being a responsible member of the Contra Costa County community and any other community in which it sets up future operations.  K2 Pure Solutions' motto, which appears on all company literature, is \"Making Life Safer\".  Corporate philosophy requires that facilities continuously identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safer technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in K2 Pure's EH&S Policy which reads:\n\n\"Protection of safety, health, environment and community is our overriding priority. All adverse incidents can and must be prevented.\"\n\n K2 Pure Solutions stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs, and in written materials available at the Plant.  K2 Pure Solutions safety and environmental programs include monthly safety meeting of all employees and a joint worker/company Safety Committee.  There will be regularly scheduled internal safety and environmental audits conducted by K2 Pure Solutions personnel and periodic safety and environmental audits of the Plant conducted by independent, third party auditors.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDescription of Stationary Source\n\nThe K2 Pure Solutions ECU and Bleach Plant is located at 950 Loveridge Road in Pittsburg California.

This consists of two proof tanks each with 100 tons capacity at 2 psig.\n\n-    High Grade Liquid Chlorine Storage which consists of two tanks each with 200 tons of capacity at 50 psig.\n\n-    Low Grade Liquid Chlorine Storage which consists of two tanks each with 50 tons of capacity at 2 psig.\n\n-    Chlorine Vaporization; Dow Chemical Chlorine Supply\n\n-    Chlorine Vaporization; Bleach Production Unit\n\nChlorine is generated as a wet, hot, low pressure gas (4 PSIG & 190oF) by the electrolysis of brine at a maximum rate of 300 tons per day (100% basis). The gas exits the electrolyzers and is then cooled in two steps to remove most of the water. A portion of the cooled gas may be diverted to make sodium hypochlorite \"bleach\". The remainder enters a series of towers in which the rest of the water is removed by direct contact with sulfuric acid.\n\nOnce the water is removed, the gas is approximately 97% chlorine by volume with the other 3% being comprised of mostly oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This dry gas is then cooled by contacting it with liquid chlorine in the Suction Chiller. A portion of the liquid feed is not vaporized and is removed from the bottom of the Suction Chiller to the Low Grade Chlorine Storage Tanks. Each of these storage tanks, which are maintained at 2 PSIG, has a maximum capacity of 50 tons of chlorine. One tank is operated normally empty and the other is maintained with some inventor"

A portion of the compressed gas (up to 100 tons/day) is diverted to make sodium hypochlorite \"bleach\" by direct contact with a solution of sodium hydroxide. All of the remaining compressed gas (up to 200 tons/day) is converted to liquid chlorine when the gas is cooled in two stages of refrigeration. The liquid chlorine from the liquefaction step is collected in the Chlorine Proof Tanks. Each of these storage tanks, which are maintained at 2 PSIG, has a maximum capacity of 100 tons of chlorine. These tanks are operated so that one is being filled while the other is being emptied.\n\nLiquid chlorine collected in the Chlorine Proof Tanks is analyzed to verify that it meets the quality specification requirements, and is then transferred to the High Grade Chlorine Storage Tanks. Each of these storage tanks, which are maintained at 50 PSIG, has a maximum capacity of 200 tons of chlorine. During operations, one tank is normally empty and the other is maintained with some inventory (200 tons or less).\n\nLiquid collected in the Low Grade Chlorine Storage Tanks is vaporized and used to supplement the chlorine flow to the sodium hypochlorite \"bleach\" plant. Liquid in the High Grade Chlorine Storage Tanks is vaporized and used to supply Dow with chlorine via pipeline. None of the chlorine is loaded into railcars, ton containers, or any other form of transport vessel.\n\nIn addition to various meteorological parameters that could lessen the off-site consequences, the facility has the following engineering controls in place to reduce the amount of a release that are not allowed to be considered when preparing the worst case release:\n\n-    Area monitors to detect and alarm when chlorine is detected in the atmosphere.\n\n-    Ability to transfer chlorine from a leaking tank to another tank via a pump and / or padding system.\n\n-    Ability to vent and evacuate a tank"

This management system satisfies the requirements of Section 2735.6of the CalARP regulation and ensures that the risk management program elements are developed and continually improved.  All records associated with the prevention program elements will be retained for a minimum of five years unless otherwise specified in the CalARP regulation.  \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe prevention programs described in the following section represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment.  Many of these prevention programs (e.g., PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigation) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls).  Those recommendations that are planned for implementation at the K2 Pure Solutions Pittsburg Plant will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\".  Those applicable safeguards that have already been implemented or that were part of the original design are described below.

These elements include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nAll employees of the Pittsburg Plant shall have available to them written process safety information that will enable them to identify and understand the hazards posed by every process within the plant.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nNew facilities and/or processes and significant process changes to existing facilities in the K2 Pure Solutions Pittsburg Plant shall be subject to a hazard review prior to start-up.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures must be current and technically accurate. All written operating procedures must be understandable by even the most inexperienced employee, and therefore must be written with that thought in mind.  Written operating procedures will be used for initial employee training as well as required refresher training for experienced employees.\n\nTraining\n\nAll employees involved in operating, maintaining and supervising a process facility will be trained in an overview of the process and receive task or position-specific training to provide the necessary skills and knowledge to safely and competently perform their job functions.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nA well-established mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment critical to process safety is fabricated to meet process specifications, installed correctly, and maintained in a safe operating condition. It also allows maintenance employees to preemptively identify and correct equipment deficiencies to avoid associated incidents and down time.
