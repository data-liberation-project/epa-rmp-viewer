The same properties that make this chemical valuable for making drinking water safe also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions. These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of our chlorination system to control human and environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding communities. \n\n\n\nIt is Coastal Water Authoritys policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  The safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at CWA and we often exceed standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of this chemical to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction \n\n\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at CWA. Senior managements commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment. \n\n\n\nFacility Description and regulated substances handled \n\n\n\nThe Lynchburg Pump Station covers approximately 220 acres, including reservoirs. It is located at 908 Independence Parkway North, Baytown, Texas in Harris County. Our facility has increased the amount of treated water to a maximum of 600,000,000 gallons of water per day. \n\n\n\nThere is a maximum of twenty seven (27) full-time employees at the plant site at any one time. \n\n\n\nWe presently handle only one chemical which are considered toxic by the EPA.

Therefore it is included in our risk management program. \n\n\n\nChlorine (CAS7782-50-5): This water treatment chemical is used in conjunction with 19%ammonium hydroxide to control biofouling within the CWA A, B and C systems. It is received at the plant in one ton containers where the normally gaseous chlorine is stored as a pressurized liquid. These containers are standard DOT and Chlorine Institute specified containers. Deliveries of chlorine are made at the plant approximately 2 to 3 times per week. The plant has a maximum inventory of 96,000 pounds of chlorine. During normal operation, six containers (12,000 pounds maximum) are in service at any one time. \n\n\n\nAccidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps \n\n\n\nCoastal Water Authority contracted with an outside engineering firm to assist in the development of a prevention program tailored exclusively to water treatment operations. This prevention program was designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects; the primary objective being to ensure complete containment of chlorine through safe operation and maintenance of the water treatment systems. \n\n\n\nThe prevention program has been designed with the following objectives:\n\n\n\nEnhancement of the mechanical integrity of all chlorine equipment and piping,\n\nCompilation of safety information to improve hazard awareness, and\n\nTraining to increase hazard recognition.\n\n\n\nFive year accident history\n\n\n\nCoastal Water Authoritys Lynchburg Pump Station has not had an accidental release of EPA regulated chemical within the past five years that resulted in an onsite injury or affected the community adversely.\n\n\n\nCWA has a comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation process.

Root cause and corrective actions are also required in order to determine incident prevention steps. Progress regarding corrective action on all investigated incidents is required to be tracked through to completion.\n\n\n\nCWA currently handles one regulated toxic substances (chlorine) above threshold quantities at the Lynchburg Pump Station. We made a decision to not respond to catastrophic releases of chlorine. Instead, our employees have been instructed to call 911 and notify the Fire Department, notify the North Channel LEPC, notify the National Response Center (NRC) and to evacuate in the event of such a catastrophic incident. CWA maintains a Chlorine Institute Emergency Kit B and several Scott Air Packs on-site for emergency response.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule, CWA is included in the North Channel LEPC local emergency response plan under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n\n\n\nPlanned improvements to reduce risk\n\n\n\nInvestigation of inherently safer technologies, chemical inventory reduction through usage studies and administrative limits, and fail safe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements occurring at CWA. We upgraded our chlorine sensors from one to four. We installed a halogen auto-close system for chlorine valves.  Safety depends upon our management commitment, the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent to our chlorination system, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our employees.\n\n"
