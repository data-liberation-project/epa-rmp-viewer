Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\nB. Description of the stationary source and regulated substances\nC. General accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps (Management Systems for Process Safety/Risk Management)\nD. Planned changes \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Westlake Petrochemical plant in Sulphur LA has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\nA. DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY\n\nThe Westlake Petrochemical site is located in an industrial complex in Sulphur Louisiana.  It operates several individual operating units.  All facilities are on a contiguous site.\n\nB. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR PROCESS SAFETY/RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nB.1. SCOPE\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at the Westlake Chemical Corporation.  Because the processes at the site that are covered by the EPA RMP regulation are subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  Westlake believes the requirements of the two regulations are so similar, or so complimentary, that only one management system is required to comply with all of them.

EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nWestlake encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the site and addresses each program element.  In addition, the site has onsite committees dedicated to safety that include members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nB.3. PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Westlake sites keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents are available to all personnel onsite in paper form or through our computerized document management system.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A list of reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS) that are available to employees through the computerized document management system and in the central MSDS file.

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within safe limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe site also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nB.4. PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nWestlake has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe site primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique along with checklists to perform these evaluations.  The combination of HAZOP and checklist analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and engineering expertise as well as knowledge of the analysis technique being used.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on relative ris"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nWestlake maintains a written emergency response program which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, and post incident cleanup requirements.  In addition, the site has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes or other facilities.  Affected personnel are informed of changes and trained appropriately.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the site is coordinated with the Southwest LA Mutual Aid Association.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The site has around the clock communications capability with appropriate Mutual Aid officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department).  This capability provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In ad"
