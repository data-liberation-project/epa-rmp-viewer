(Carpenter) to comply fully with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations regarding the proper handling, use, storage, emission, discharge and disposal of all chemicals, hazardous or otherwise.  Furthermore, Carpenter is committed to protecting the health and welfare of both its employees and community residents.  As part of its ongoing research and development efforts, Carpenter is contually investigating and evaluating the potential of various alternative chemicals and/or manufacturing processes with the goal of reducing or eliminating its use of hazardous chemicals wherever feasible.\r\n\r\nCarpenter aggressively pursues and accomplishes these goals by an ongoing commitment of resources to and high performance requirements for the efforts.\r\n\r\nMore information about accidental release prevention and emergency response is contained in the \"General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\" and \"Emergency Response Program\" sections, below.\r\n\r\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Carpenter Richmond Plant is located at 2400 to 2702 Jefferson Davis Highway in Richmond, Virginia.  Polyurethane foam cushioning products, bonded foam carpet padding, and blended chemical products are manufactured at the plant.  The foam products are sold as material for furniture, bedding, carpet padding, and similar uses.  The blended chemical products are sold as feedstock or system component chemicals for isocyanate based processes.  \r\n\r\nThe facility can store up to 1,200,000 pounds of unspecified isomer toluene diisocyanate (TDI), CAS Number 25471-62-5, exceeding the 10,000 pounds threshold value for RMP applicability.  Carpenter maintains no other regulated substances above the threshold values for RMP applicability.  TDI is stored in interior  tanks and parked rail tank cars.  The tanks hold up to 10,000 gallons each"

TDI is transported to Carpenter in railcars and tank trucks.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nCarpenter employs the following programs, practices and policies to prevent accidental releases of chemicals and TDI:\r\n  a.  Firmly established and enforced policies directing proper handling and disposal \r\n      of hazardous and other chemicals.\r\n  b.  Employee training and testing program insure proper handling of chemicals\r\n  c.  Safety check sheets for chemical related equipment and processes\r\n  d.  Inspection and maintenance of chemical related equipment\r\n  e.  Value of Order policy to keep the workplace clean and orderly\r\n  f.  Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) to prevent discharges to the storm \r\n      water system\r\n  g.  SWPPP monthly inspections to assure plan compliance\r\n  g.  Hazard Communication Program to assure proper labeling and safe handling of \r\n      chemicals by employees.  All employees receive this training.\r\n  h.  Chemical hygiene plan for laboratory workers for safe handling of chemicals and \r\n      release prevention\r\n  i.  TDI exposure monitoring program for employees regularly working around TDI\r\n  j.  Special training to handle TDI and its wastes for employees working with TDI \r\n      related processes and equipment\r\n  k.  TDI storage tanks are all inside the building have spill containment dikes or \r\n      structures to control spills\r\n  l.  TDI tank truck station and rail tank car stations are located inside the building  \r\n      and have containment areas to control spills\r\n  m.  TDI rail car stations(two stations) each have a permanent spill pan system capable \r\n      of holding at least 400 gallons before overflowing to the overall containment area\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nCarpenter has had no applicable accidents in the past five years.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe Hazardous Waste Management Contingency Plan"

      "SummaryText": "(HWMCP) is the primary plan for responding to all accidental chemical and TDI releases, and fire and explosion emergencies.  It complies with OSHA Hazardous Waste and Emergency Operations (HAZWOPER) regulation (29 CFR A\u00a7 1910.120) as well as state and local regulations.  The Plan includes:\r\n          1.  Contingency plan\r\n          2.  Evacuation plan\r\n          3.  Chemical spill response procedures\r\n          4.  Notification requirements and quidelines\r\n          5.  Reportable quantities requirements and guidelines\r\n\r\nThe HWMCP establishes the method of notification, control, and clean up of hazardous materials from accidental chemical releases at the plant.  Every year, an updated copy of the HWMCP is submitted to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, the Richmond Police Planning Division, the Richmond Fire Prevention agency, Capital Medical Center in Richmond, Richmond's Fire Station #21, the Richmond Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and Richmond's Department of Emergency Services.  \r\n\r\nThe annual Tier II Emergency And Hazardous Chemical Inventory report is sent to the Virginia Emergency Response Council and to the Richmond LEPC, which is also the local fire department with jurisdiction over the facility.  The Tier II report provides information about the amount and location of TDI and other chemicals at the facility.\r\n\r\nCarpenter has an employee Spill Response Team (the Spill Team) with one or more members present every working day.  The Spill Team receives appropriate training and is drilled quarterly to assure they are prepared to respond to accidental TDI and other chemical spills.  The Spill Team is trained in hazardous material handling as required by 1910.120 of OSHA regulations.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nNo significant equipment or procedure changes are planned at this time.  Carpenter will continue to maintain its existing policies and programs, as described above, and explore further improvements."
