If an emergency were to accur, it is our policy to notify the Williston Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is an anhydrous ammonia storage plant. We have a 30,000 gallon storage tank, which we use to fill nurse tanks for retail use for local farmers.\n\nOur worst case scenario would be failure of our bulk storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85%), resulting in a gas release. According to the EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles. Our location is within 1 mile of the city limits of Williston, along with additional residential and commercial locations within 4 miles of our plant.\n\nThis facility complies with all Federal, State, and local codes and regulations involving accident prevention, and maintenance. Our anhydrous ammonia bulk tank is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with all State and Federal laws.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that has caused death, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Williston Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the Fire Department, and members of the Fire Department have inspected our plant, and have been through the proper safety training."
