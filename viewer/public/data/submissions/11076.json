Carter-Wallace began its operations at the Momence Distribution Center in February 1977. The Momence Distribution Center consists of administrative offices, warehouse storage and shipping areas.\n\nThe Momence Distribution Center includes 33,600 square feet of warehouse storage capacity  and is situated in a commercial / residential  zone.  The warehouse operates five days per week, eight hours per day, and employs 10 people.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe operations affected by the risk management plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol antiperspirant product in consumer size containers.   Product is moved throughout the  warehouse via forklift trucks.\n\nVarious hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the aerosol antiperspirant product.  The hydrocarbons are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials.  The USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release associated with handling hazardous materials. The aerosol product propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability. \n\nThe Momence Distribution Center is used only for product storage and distribution.  There are no manufacturing activities at this location.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe operations have not had any major release of product or accidents within the five year accident review period.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what is defined as a worst case release scenario.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is defined as the sudden loss of containment of the product in the largest tank, vessel or container. The worst case release scenario assumes that several highly unlikely events occur simultaneously such as:\n\nCatastrophic failure of  aerosol cans wi"

      "SummaryText": "thin a case;\nFailure of all automated safety and alarm systems;\nFailure of our trained and experienced operators to respond appropriately; and\nThe event occurs during least likely stagnant meteorological conditions.\n\n Carter-Wallace used USEPA developed guidance (Risk Management Program Guidance for Warehouses) to complete the modeling of the worst case release scenario.  The modeling shows that there would be no impact on the surrounding community.\n\nThese results classify the Momence Distribution Center as a USEPA defined Program 1 facility.  A Program 1 facility, as defined by the USEPA, presents a minimal risk to the community\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nCarter-Wallace has developed programs to comply with the required environmental, health and safety standards. We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through:\n\nCompliance audits                                \nOperating procedures\nAccident investigation \nTraining\nEmployee participation\n\n\nIn addition to our management programs, we have emergency response systems to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases.  These include a facility wide sprinkler system, two fire response stations and portable fire extinguishers throughout the facility.  All emergency response systems are routinely inspected. All of our forklift operators are trained and certified.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCarter-Wallace has created a culture of continuous improvement of its safety program.  We train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  We also encourage our employees to suggest changes or improvements that will help minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment including the forklift trucks."
