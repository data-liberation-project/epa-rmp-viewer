If a worst-case scenario does occur, emergency procedures will be immediate taken i.e. contact emergency services.  \r\n(B)\t\r\na.\tThe alternative release scenario was derived using RMP*Comp.  The speculated alternative release is a smaller puncture hole to the storage tanks.  The scenario identified is the un-monitored flow of Iso-pentane during the release.  This scenario was selected because it is the most likely occurrence that will go temporarily un-noticed, resulting in emergency measures.\r\nb.\tAdministrative controls and engineering controls will help to prevent this from occurring.  Training, awareness and dike walls are the controls that will help deter this scenario.  The dike walls will be most beneficial in this scenario because they will prevent the Iso-pentane from leaving the containment area.  The dikes were designed to hold the total quantity of the tank which was released.  Annual Inspections of the RMP includes a Human Factors review which aids in assessing and recognizing hazards.  \r\n(C)\t\r\na.\tThe worst case estimated quantity released is 34,833 lbs.  This is determined by taken 6,560 gallons (largest tank) and multiplying it by 5.3 (lbs/gal of pentane).  The release rate is 194 lbs per minute (derived from RMP*Comp).  The alternative release scenario is a vapor cloud fire.  This would have a release duration of 10 minutes (the average time to notice a drop in pentane pressure) and a rate of 25 lbs per minute.  Again, RMP*Comp was used in determining endpoints affected.  \r\nb.\tThe release rates are based on knowledge and assumptions of calculating the vessel  and flow rates caused by the scenario.  The release rate of the worst-case scenario is based on a large hole in the vessel and the loss of approximately 194 gallons a minute and duration of 10 minutes.  10 minutes is based on the time it would take to notice a rapid drop in the pentane pressure.

During the manufacturing process of EPS, Iso-pentane is used as a blowing agent and is an essential key component to the product.  Due to the storage of Iso-pentane in a quantity over the threshold limit of 10,000 lbs., Polysource is subject to compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program.  Due to the nature of codes and regulations continually changing, individuals should not rely on the codes and regulations stated in this document as being completely accurate and all inclusive.  \r\n\r\n\tBy implementing the Risk Management Plan, it is not only the intent of Polysource to be in compliance with the regulations set by federal and state agencies, but to protect its employees and members of the surrounding community.  The following information contained in this document is intended to be used as a reference to maintain compliance with the RMP.  A copy of this document will be located at a point of use for all employees to access, should an emergency situation arise.  \r\n\r\nREGISTRATION\r\n\r\n\tThe facility registration has been completed using the RMP*e-Submit program.  The information contained in the registration is available on the internet or can be requested in hard copy form.  Requests by the public for information pertaining to the RMP will be dealt with by the President/CEO.  \r\n\r\nPOPULATION DATA\r\n\r\n\tBased on OAC 3745-104-12 Population Data, it is stated that \"the owner or operator shall estimate the population in the RMP.\"  The population data shall include information pertaining to residences, institutions (schools, hospitals etc.), recreational areas and industrial buildings.

The items listed below are key items that contribute to the Hazard Assessment.  These items were reviewed and compiled to satisfy the requirement of OAC 3745-104-15 Hazard Assessment.\r\n\tMaterial Stored Above Threshold Quantity\r\n\tAppendix B contains the information used in determining the maximum amount of Iso-pentane stored at the facility.  These figures shall not be exceeded based on their relevance to the maximum quantity that can be held by the storage tanks.  \r\n\r\n\tWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\n\tThe determination of the worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario were conducted using RMP*Comp: (http://www.epa.gov/osweroe1/content/rmp/rmp_comp_download.htm)\r\nThe Worst-Case Release endpoint is 0.1 miles.  Within this distance there are no industrial receptors at this time.  There are a minimal number of residences that are potentially within this limit.  These residences are potentially in the limit based on the tolerances of the tools used in developing the population data.  The Alternative Scenario is less than 0.1 miles.  Based on the distance on the Alternative Scenario, there will be no impact on surrounding residences or other structures.  The results from the RMP*Comp for Worst-Case and Alternative Case can be found in Appendix B.  The maximum tank capacity is also located in Appendix B.\r\n\r\n\t5-Year Accident History\r\n\tDuring the past 5 years, the facility has not had an accidental release of Iso-pentane which resulted in death, injury, or an offsite impacts.  The facility has never had an accidental release in the history of the program.  Measure will always be taken to ensure that the facility remains at a 0% accident history.

The conservation value, for normal venting, will prevent the tank pressures of exceeding 2.0psig.  The tanks are equipped with emergency rupture disks that area rated for 2.5psig (as stated in NFPA 30).  The based on the 2 safe-guards installed on the tanks (vents and rupture disks) the chance of over pressurization is minimal.  The operating temperature of the tanks (at atmospheric pressure) is expected to be within 10 degrees F of the ambient air temperature. The Iso-pentane is distributed to the manufacturing area piping system.  The Iso-pentanes is moved using a pump that operates at a maximum operating pressure of 90psig.  The normal operating pressure of the pumps is 70psig +- 5psig.  If the pressure exceeds 90psig, a pressure relief will activate preventing the over pressurization of the piping.  In the event of a major drop in pressure, an automatic shut-off will deactivate the pump.  This will prevent an accidental release into the production area.  Another safety measure that is in place is the Emergency Shut-Off located in the production area.  This is located by line 2 and is clearly marked.  Activating this shut-off will result in the immediate deactivation of the pumping system.  The final stage the Iso-pentane is to have it directly injected into th"

Based on current guidelines the tanks will need inspected every 10 years using the API 653 standard as long as the tanks are not moved or altered in a drastic manner.  These inspections will be done by an outside vendor and records will be maintained by the maintenance manager.  \r\n\tAnnual Inspections will be completed by the RMP representative.  Each inspection will be retained for a minimum of 5 years to show compliance to the RMP requirements.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE \r\nAll employees receive training on the emergency response program.  This program will be evaluated regularly to determine if changes are needed.  Appendix D contains a copy of the Emergency Response Plan.  An Emergency Contact list is also located in Appendix E with the pertinent people to contact in the event of an emergency.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nPopulation Data\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe population data used or the current RMP was developed by using a variety of tools.  The Worst-Case and Alternative Release scenarios were developed by using RMP*Comp.  This tool determined that a Worst-Case scenario would affect a 0.1 mile radius, while an Alternative scenario would affect less than 0.1 mile (See Appendix B).  A Bushnell laser range finder was used to determine that there are residences that are potentially within the .1 mile radius.  Google Earth was used to derive Latitude and Longitude coordinates for Polysource, Inc.  The coordinat"

      "SummaryText": "es for the tanks are Latitude: 40.13564 and Longitude -84.22545   When these coordinates were plugged in to Landview 6, it was determined that there are 3 residences within 0.1 mile of the coordinates used.  According to the 2010 Census Data, there is a total population of 8 people within 0.1 mile of the coordinates used.  The Alternative Release Scenario will not affect any population based on the fact that there are no receptors less than 0.1 mile from the coordinates used.  There are no institutions, parks or recreational areas, or schools within the 0.1 mile radius.\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nRMP*Comp was used to determine factors associated with the Hazard Assessment.  \r\n\r\n(A)\t \r\na.\tWorst-case scenario is based on a vapor cloud explosion with an affected distance endpoint of .1miles.  This was derived using RMP*Comp.  A copy of the RMP*Comp is part of this Appendix B.  The rationale and assumptions used for this program are based off of the MSDS's, and safe work standards in developing the safe work practices associated with Iso-pentane.\r\nb.\tThe vessels at Polysource are 2 \"bullet-style\" vessels with operating at atmospheric pressure.  The vessels are carbon steel construction butt welded together and painted with exterior elements resistive paint.  The piping and valves used for the movement of the Iso-pentane meet the specifications of standardized gas/fluid containment.  An external engineering contractor was used for the inspection of the vessels and system upon initial installation.\r\nc.\tAdministrative controls and engineering controls are implemented to reduce the hazard associated with the Iso-pentane system.  Administrative controls consist of training and inspections of the system.  Engineering controls consist of pressure relief valves, routine maintenance and dike walls.\r\nd.\tThe anticipated effects of these controls are to minimize the accidental worst-case scenario release through prevention and awareness.  The worst-case scenario of a vapor cloud explosion ca"
