Executive Summary\n\nGEO Specialty Chemical's Trimet Plant in Allentown, Pa., is committed to operating and maintaining processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs help ensure the safety of employees, the public and the environment.  \n\nFormaldehyde is the only chemical used onsite that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Formaldehyde is used as a raw material in other processes, and what is not used internally is shipped to customers.\n\nThe Plant has developed and implemented an effective release prevention program. A management Team,consisting of qualified management personnel is accountable\nfor enforcement and oversight of the elements of the release prevention program.\n\nEmergency Response to any potential incident at the plant is accomplished in accordance with the site's Emergency Response Plan. The Emergency Response Plan identifies response capabilities and qualification requirements of the onsite Emergency Response Team. The Plan complies with the emergency response requirements of OSHA, EPA and PADEP. \n\nThe process includes alarms, shutdown systems, isolation valves, and other safeguards to minimize the risk associated with accidental releases.\n\n"
