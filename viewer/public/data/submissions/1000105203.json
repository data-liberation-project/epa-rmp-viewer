Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Milk Specialties Global has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM \nrelated activities. \n\n1.1 Milk Specialties Global, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Milk Specialties Global has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                     | Process Chemical                    | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nAmmonia Refrigeration Process      Anhydrous Ammonia                     11,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\nFacility Overview\n\nMilk Specialties operates a production facility for dairy products in Visalia, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n(15) Silos\n(2) Ice Builders\n(4) Falling Film Chillers\n(3) Plate and Frame Heat Exchangers \n(1) Upper Vat Room Air Handling Unit\n\nFacility Location\nMilk Specialties is located at 715 N. Divisadero Street Visalia, CA 93291. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.33636018, -119.31210. The facility is located approximately \u00bd mile north of state highway 198 in an industrial area surrounded primarily by businesses and residences.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \u0093a special flood hazard area\u0094. The elevation of the machinery room was designed with the flood hazards in mind.\n\nMilk Specialties is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Milk Specialties had a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\nDescription of Covered Processes\nAmmonia\n\nThe heat exchangers are equipped with surge drums as required for flooded operation. Most control valve groups are located at a working level, on a working platform, or on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within the machinery room, the outside machi"

As such, the refrigeration system at Milk Specialties is treated as a single process.\n\nRAGAGEP Statement\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration\n\nThe process equipment was inspected during the PHA for the purpose of verifying that the process was designed, fabricated, and is being operated in accordance with applicable industry standards. It is unclear which  codes and standards were followed in the original design and construction of the refrigeration system. The pressure vessels are equipped with nameplates which span the years 1994-2002. Due to the fact that the system is not equipped with an ammonia diffusion tank, it is the judgment of the PHA team that the system most closely aligns with the 1991 Uniform Mechanical/Fire Codes.\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in a"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nMilk Specialties Global has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Milk Specialties Global facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates year-round. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 11,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\nMilk Specialties Global has had no accidental releases within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\nMilk Specialties Global's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR \u00a75189(n)\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements] - Title"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMilk Specialties Global has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Milk Specialties Global continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Milk Specialties Global's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Milk Specialties Global's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nMilk Specialties Global has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with acce"

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Milk Specialties Global employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Milk Specialties Global will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
