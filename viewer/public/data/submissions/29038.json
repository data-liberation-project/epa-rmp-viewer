      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan covers the Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's chicken processing facility at Moorefield, West Virginia, a single stationary source.  The facility's refrigeration system is a standard two-stage refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in the system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy follow the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (\"one plan\") and is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of two ammonia release scenarios identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternate release scenario\".  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the \u00bf maximum quantity in the largest vessel \u00bf is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Pilgrim's Pride Moorefield facility  involves a failure of the High Pressure Receiver under maximum storage conditions.  The computer program, RMP*Comp, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  This scenario was perf"

The EPA-mandated meteorological conditions used for this scenario were Atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (77\u00b0 F), and average humidity (50%).  \n\nThe EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n1.The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia this vessel could hold is approximately twice as much ammonia that is normally stored in this vessel.  This receiver will seldom, if ever, reach maximum capacity.\n\n2.Assumption is that ammonia liquefied under pressure is released at its boiling point.  At true atmospheric conditions only a fraction (about 20% of the total) of the liquid ammonia will release to the atmosphere flashing as a vapor.  The remaining un-flashed liquid will stay in the vessel or pool on the ground.\n\n3.Requirement to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard.\n\n4.Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6% of the area of the full circle.\n\n5.Assumption of a ground level release when actually the vessel is on the roof.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of a ammonia due to the rupture of a condenser tube.  Rupture could occur if corrosion weakened the tube and an additional force, such as pressure from the loss of a water pump, was placed on the tube.  The scenario, by definition, is \"more likely to occur\" than the worst case scenario and must reach an endpoint off site using the typical meteorological conditions of"

We do, however, conduct non-destructive testing of the thickness of our pipes, vessels and condenser tubes on a regular schedule to find any corrosion problems early and correct them as soon as possible.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\u00b7Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners\n\u00b7Preventative maintenance program\n\u00b7Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners\n\u00b7Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\n\u00b7Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\u00b7Procedure for handling all changes to the system\n\u00b7Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\n\u00b7Up-to-date process safety information\n\u00b7Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\n\u00b7Hot-work permits for work on or near the ammonia process.\n\u00b7Line Break procedures\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrims Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.
