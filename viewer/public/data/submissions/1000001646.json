We also strive to reuse or reclaim materials to the greatest extent economically feasible, to minimize the amount of waste requiring disposal. While this prevention approach is preferable, some amount of after-the-fact treatment of wastes is required in our manufacturing processes.

Five-year accident History\r\n\r\nIn February 2010 the facility experienced a propylene oxide excursion when catalyst was left out of the reactor preventing the product from reacting. Several attempts were made to troubleshoot the reaction with PO being vented to the scrubber and new PO added. This action overcharged the scrubber capacilty with an estimated 9,500 pounds of PO. An estimated 2,740 pounds PO was discharged from the scrubber to the atmosphere.  Lab testing for catalyst before the oxide addition was added to the process operating instruction to prevent this from reoccurring.\r\n\r\n5.
