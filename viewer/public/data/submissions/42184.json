Norfolk, Nebraska facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Tyson employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. This plan covers all Tyson owned activities at this facility.\nTyson?s management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n2.  Facility Description\nTyson operates a processing facility for beef fabrication.  Support operations include truck docks for shipping and receiving, cold storage operations and administrative offices.\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Norfolk, Nebraska facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n?    40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n?    29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n?    40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\nThe key "

Tyson has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Tyson management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia system.\nTyson policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  Tyson maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\nTyson is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, Tyson conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.\n4.  Five Year Accident History\nBetween March 1999 and March 2004,  Tyson has had one reportable accident that qualified for the five year accident history.  None of the releases affected the public or the environment.  The release resulting in an injury occurred on November 1, 2001 and released a total estimated quantity of 7,800 pounds of ammonia.  The incident lasted for 48 minutes and resulted in one Tyson employee going to the hospital for examination.  \n5.  Emergency Response Program\nTyson has personnel trained in emergency response at the facility 24 hours per day, seven days per week, with the exception of holidays.  These personnel receive semi-annual training on "
