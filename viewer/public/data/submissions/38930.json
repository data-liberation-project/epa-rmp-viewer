Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Total Inputs Inc. are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application and for crop production nutrients. The maximum quantity stored would be 200,000 pounds in storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n  a. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85% capacity as limited by deseighn standards and administrative controls. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .94 miles.\n\n  b. The alternate release scenario, a 3 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario follwed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shutt-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximume quantity released would be 28,000 pounds. The distance to end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .6 miles. (The most likely potential incedent, would be a release from a breake in a 1 inch transfer hose scenario followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic axcess flow shut-off valve/valves intervenes with this  or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released with thi scenario would be "

      "SummaryText": "2,901 pounds. The distance to end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Prevention Program.\n\n  The facility is in compliance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR1910.111 \"storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA standard is refenced in this RMP Registration Form, see section 8.3(b). And the State of Illinois.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History.\n\n There have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Action Plan.\n\n    The facility has: \n\n    a.  A written plan , in accordance OSHA Standard 29cfr 1910.38;\n\n    b.  Provides State and Local authorities with the emergency planning and community right- to- know information as required under Sara Title III ( EPCRA);\n\n    c.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes palce at the facility, the required response action is to evecuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emerency response numbers .\n\n        1. With in 15 minutes of determing the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the emergency cooridinator will notify: The National Emergency Response Center @ (800)424-8802.\n\n        2. With-in 1 hour of determining the amount of the release would effect the environment, the EmergencyCoordinator will notify: The Illinois Emergency Management Agency @ (800) 782- 7860.\n \n 7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n   Safety is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions Of The Facility. There are no additional specific safety reccomendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
