In the unlikely\nevent that the responding fire department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at the location, the fire department\nwith whom the responding fire department has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned. This policy has been reviewed with\nthe fire department and LEPC/EMA.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of\nanhydrous ammonia.
