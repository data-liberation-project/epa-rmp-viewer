As a result, no significant accidental releases have occurred over the life of the various processes regulated by the PSM standard.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History:\r\n\r\nHONDA AEP had one reportable release on 11/10/2018.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nHonda of America Mfg., Inc., has developed a company-wide Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which explains\r\nHonda's commitment to emergency response. This plan describes the responsibility and procedures of Honda\r\npersonnel and establishes a system in which the members of each plant's emergency response team work with local\r\nemergency response organizations. This company-wide plan also serves as a model upon which the Honda/AEP\r\nemergency response team has based its own Honda AEP-specific ERP. The Honda AEP plan outlines how the\r\nHonda AEP emergency response team is to work closely with the Anna Fire Department, the Shelby County Hazmat\r\nTeam, and the Emergency Management Agency to promptly respond to any emergency.\r\nThe Honda AEP Emergency Response Team (ERT) meets annually with the Village of Anna Fire Chief and members\r\nof its response team to review operations at the plant. This meeting also includes an in-depth tour of the plant that\r\nincludes inspection of sumps, hydraulic pump pits and a thorough inspection of the roof.\r\n\r\nThe Honda AEP Emergency Response Team is currently made up of 12 to 15 associates on each of the three\r\nproduction shifts. The members are volunteers who work full-time in their respective production departments. There\r\nare 3 full-time emergency response staff members, one for each shift, with one (on a rotating basis) on call 24 hours a day, who are responsible for leadership and coordination of team members. Each emergency response team\r\nmember must meet Fire Fighter level I state requirements as defined in section 1001 of the National Fire Prevention\r\nAssociation (NFPA) manual and must attend quarterly tr"

The volume of ammonia\r\nin the tank is limited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Ammonia Safety Code, to 15,300-galions,\r\nto allow for vapor space in the tank. The process uses ammonia vapor, which is supplied from the headspace of the\r\ntank. If additional vapor is needed, ammonia is passed through a series of immersion heaters (vaporizers) where the\r\nliquid is vaporized into a gas. Through overhead piping, the ammonia vapor travels through a shutoff header stand\r\nand a flow meter stand prior to being introduced into the nitriding furnace.\r\n\r\nDue to the high temperature (1,110 degrees Fahrenheit) the ammonia dissociates into its components according to\r\nthe following reaction:\r\n\r\n2 Anhydrous Ammonia -> 2 Nitrogen + 3 Hydrogen\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen combines with the alloying elements in the steel to form nitrides. The nitrides form at the steel surface as a hard chemical layer which will minimize wear and fatigue. The remaining component, Hydrogen, (3H2) is burned off by the afterburner.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps at Honda AEP:\r\nIn addition to being subject to the RMP requirements, HONDA AEP is subject to and complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard to prevent accidental chemical releases from the disk core manufacturing process and the operation of the nitriding furnace. HONDA AEP surpasses the requirements of various elements of the standard, including response training, mechanical integrity and chemical-monitoring devices to maintain high levels of compliance and prevent accidental releases. Monitoring systems have built in back up systems to insure fail-safe operation/detection and therefore are highly reliable. The plant also exceeds training requirements and has appropriate material/equipment to control or stabilize process leaks and releases.

(Honda) has developed and implemented two policies which directly impact and\r\ninfluence Honda's accident release prevention and emergency response activities. First, Honda's Safety Policy\r\nexpresses Honda's commitment to:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tprovide a safe and healthful working environment,\r\n\u00bf\tconduct its operations with the highest regard for associate safety,\r\n\u00bf\tcontinually improve the safety management system,\r\n\u00bf\ttrain associates in respects to safety related to their job, and\r\n\u00bf\tcomply with all applicable safety and health requirements and standards mandated by federal, state, and local law,\r\n\r\nSecond, Honda has developed and implemented an Environmental Policy which expresses Honda's commitment to:\r\n\u00bf\tcomply with all applicable environmental requirements mandated by federal, state, and local law,\r\n\u00bf\toperate and continually improve an environmental management system, and\r\n\u00bf\timplement methods to prevent pollution, conserve natural resources and reduce waste.\r\n\r\nWith these policies as a foundation, Honda's Anna Engine Plant (Honda AEP) has made a significant effort to ensure\r\ncompliance and good management in all areas relating to chemical safety. Many of the Risk Management Program\r\n(RMP) requirements are similar or identical to requirements covered by the Occupational Safety and Health\r\nAdministration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the two Honda processes subject to RMP\r\nregulation are also subject to PSM requirements. Moreover, even before the OSHA PSM standard was adopted as\r\nfinal rule, Honda AEP maintained a high level of protection from potential chemical exposures for all Honda AEP\r\nassociates. This was accomplished through: operational controls, systems design, mechanical integrity and associate\r\ntraining. Honda AEP procedures meet all applicable PSM"

In many respects, procedures to prevent or\r\ncontrol unwanted releases at Honda AEP currently exceed PSM requirements relative to mechanical integrity and\r\nassociate training. For example, Honda AEP uses fixed head monitoring devices to detect leaks and/or releases,\r\nuses grade-specified components, replaces hardware prior to manufacturer-suggested replacement intervals, and has implemented comprehensive associate training.\r\n\r\nA Brief Description of the Honda AEP Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nHonda AEP primarily consists of six manufacturing departments:\r\n\r\n1. Aluminum Die Cast Department.\r\n\r\nIn the Aluminum Die Cast Department, raw aluminum ingots are melted in aluminum furnaces. The molten aluminum\r\nis then injected into dies either by low-pressure casting or by high-pressure casting. Low pressure casting is used to\r\nproduce engine cylinder heads. High pressure casting is used to produce engine blocks and transmission casings.\r\n\r\n2. Aluminum Machining Department.\r\n\r\nEngine blocks and cylinder heads from the Aluminum Die Cast Department are machined into finished products for\r\nuse in the Engine Assembly Department.\r\n\r\n3. Engine Assembly Department\r\n\r\nThe Engine Assembly Department consists of three assembly lines.\r\n\r\n4.

Additionally, 5 to 10 emergency\r\nresponse team members on each shift are trained to the Hazmat Technician level as defined in OSHA section\r\n1910.120 requirements.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response team members are activated by procedures identified in the Honda AEP Emergency\r\nResponse Plan. If plant security, which covers the plant switchboard 24 hours a day, receives an emergency call, they are trained to activate the alarm system and alert the emergency response pagers. The response team will be\r\nactivated and respond using procedures identified in the response plan.\r\n\r\nOutside agencies are activated by plant security by dialing 911 in the event that the response team requests their\r\nassistance or if the response team is not available to respond at full strength. Public notification of a release will be\r\nhandled jointly by the Shelby County LEPC and Sheriff's Office. The AEP Emergency Response Plan is reviewed\r\nannually with the local Emergency Management Agency (EMA), the Village of Anna Fire Department, the Shelby\r\nCounty LEPC, and the Shelby County Sheriff's Office.\r\n\r\nPlanned Improvements to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nHonda AEP, through its continuous improvement process, is constantly seeking methods to improve safety\r\nthroughout the operation."
