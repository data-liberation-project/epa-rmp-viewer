This facility is a commercial bakery, which operates a single ammonia system to cool bread products prior to distribution and chill glycol for cooling mixing equipment.  This program has been prepared pursuant to Part 68, Subpart G of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n\n\nThe system contains approximately 49,000 pounds of ammonia.  The maximum quantity of ammonia contained on site is approximately 49,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nTo prevent the accidental release of ammonia, Maple Leaf has developed the following: \n\n\n\n-     Maintenance procedures to ensure that equipment is properly maintained and functioning properly.\n\n-    Operating procedures to ensure that equipment is operated in a manner that minimizes the possibility of an ammonia release.\n\n-     Employee training to ensure that operators know how to properly use the equipment and non-operators are aware of the dangers of ammonia and the necessary steps to take in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nThe programs are contained in Binder 4: Ammonia Operating Procedures.\n\n\n\nThe general emergency response policy for the site when ammonia is released is to evacuate to an area upwind of the release and notify the appropriate personnel and authorities.  Trained personnel will then assess whether to evacuate the facility, and determine the appropriate level of response.  A copy of the Emergency Response Plan for Maple Leaf can be found in Binder 3.  A description of the ERP is contained in Section 6.0 Emergency Response Program in this document.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Substance Handled\n\n\n\nAs explained above, Maple Leaf operates a single ammonia cooling system to cool and/or freeze bread products prior to shipment, and to chill glycol for on site material mixing. \n\n\n\nIn orde"
