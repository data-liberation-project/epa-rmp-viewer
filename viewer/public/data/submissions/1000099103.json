The Pilot Goldsmith Plant receives gas from Kinder Morgan's Goldsmith Landreth San Andres Unit. The production stream is treated to separate gas, water and condensate in Kinder Morgan's plant. The gas is then piped to the Pilot Goldsmith Plant where it is processed through a refrigeration process involving temperature change which condenses hydrocarbons, propane +, forming a natural gas liquid (NGL) Y grade product. \n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes a propane refrigeration system. Propane storage of 5,000 gallons is located onsite and is associated with the refrigeration system. \n\n\n\nA total rupture of the 5,000 gallon propane accumulator tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion, would pose the worse-case scenario for the Pilot Goldsmith Plant. The 5,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles. Public receptors are located within a 0.2 mile radius of the propane tank. The worst case scenario has the potential to affect persons within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. The plant is also subject to OSHA's PSM program. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 3 level RMP under 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nA total rupture of the partially filled 5,000 gallon propane accumulator tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion, was modeled as an Alternative-Release scenario for the Pilot Goldsmith Plant. The 5,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for half filled tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles. Public receptors are within a 0.1 mile radius of the propane vessel. \n\n\n\nThe Pilot Goldsmith Plant is located in a remote area and is normally occupied by Golden Hammer personnel. There is no accident history to report. Should an emergency involving the Pilot Goldsmith Plant occur, it is Golden H"

This policy has been discussed with the local fire chief in Goldsmith, TX.\n\n&#8195;\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Pilot Goldsmith Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, Pilot Goldsmith Plant trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the Pilot Goldsmith Plant, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Pilot Goldsmith Plant maintains an emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: \n\n1. proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, \n\n2. evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and\n\n3. notification of local emergency response agencies \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties. This plan will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant. Plant personnel will not respond to a major event that threatens or results in fire or explosion but will put the evacuation and notification of emergency response plan in place during such an event.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Pilot Goldsmith Plant has been coordinated with the Ector County Fire Department - District 1.

If a deficiency is identified that presents an immediate safety concern, Pilot Goldsmith Plant personnel will correct the defect before placing the equipment back into service. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Pilot Goldsmith Plant has safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety. Examples of these include: \n\n(1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, \n\n(2) a lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, \n\n(3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process     piping or equipment is opened, \n\n(4) a permit and procedure (required from and supplied by third party contractors) to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and \n\n(5) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. \n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\n\n&#8195;\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Pilot Goldsmith Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including operating conditions of the process), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to -\n\n\n\n(1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and \n\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. \n\n\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated prior to incorporating these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel and affected contractors are provided any necessary training on the change."

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Pilot Goldsmith Plant will promptly investigate any incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Pilot Goldsmith Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Pilot Goldsmith Plant will periodically conduct an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits will be conducted at least every 3 years. Personnel familiar with the facility and Process Safety Management participate in these audits. The audit team will develop findings that are forwarded to Pilot Goldsmith Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports will be retained. \n\n&#8195;\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Pilot Goldsmith Plant have potential hazards that are managed for continued safe operation.
