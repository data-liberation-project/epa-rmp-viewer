      "SummaryText": "Vandenberg Air Force Base (AFB) is the third largest Air Force installation in the nation encompassing over 99,579 acres in Santa Barbara County, California.  Because of its geography, this installation provides America with a unique location from which it can place satellites into polar orbit without overflying populated areas during the launch phase.  This mission--which is crucial to national security as well as the burgeoning interest in communications, land resources surveillance, and space research--is dependent on the continued launching of an array of space boosters.  In addition, Vandenberg AFB conducts test launches involving Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and also manages the Western Range--a vast network of radar, telemetry, and optical sensors stretching across the Pacific Ocean--in which all three services conduct a variety of aeronautical and missile flight activities.  The host unit on Vandenberg AFB is the 30th Space Wing.\r\n\r\nWhile Vandenberg AFB comprises 620 maintained buildings and structures plus 999 family residences for military personnel, only 15 percent of its total area is developed.  The remainder provides the buffer needed to preclude encroachment by local development and to protect outlying communities from launch anomalies and associated operational hazards.  Restrictive easements limiting development on adjacent private land further reduces any potential risk to the public.  Significantly, over the last 57 years, approximately 2000 launches of space boosters and ICBMs have been conducted at Vandenberg AFB, and there is no known instance of serious injury or death to anyone in the surrounding communities due to the launches themselves or to supporting operations.\r\n\r\nWith this submittal, Vandenberg AFB is making a conscientious effort to fully comply with Section 112r of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 as implemented by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (40 CFR 68), as well as with the Califor"

The format developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for this submittal is generally oriented towards stationary sources that differ significantly from Vandenberg AFB in terms of physical complexity, emergency response capability, and organizational make-up.  Accordingly, additional detail and clarification are incorporated in this Executive Summary to provide the public a clearer, more complete insight into the scope and effectiveness of Vandenberg AFB's accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\r\n\r\nScope of the Vandenberg AFB Risk Management Plan\r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) includes all covered processes within the borders of Vandenberg AFB that are subject to Department of the Air Force oversight and control.  Under the Commercial Space Act, excess facilities on the base may be leased by private entities to conduct commercial activities that are not under the purview of the Department of the Air Force.  Compliance with EPA RMP and CalARP requirements for covered processes that solely support such commercial activities is the responsibility of the respective commercial owner and operator; therefore, any such covered processes are not encompassed by this RMP.\r\n\r\nThis RMP includes one process in which the EPA threshold of a regulated toxic or flammable substance is exceeded--the Hypergolic Storage Facility.  This facility stores and handles the regulated toxics 1,1 dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), hydrazine, and methyl hydrazine. The largest quantities of UDMH and hydrazine occur in an approximately one-to-one mixture of the two typically referred to as Aerozine 50.  In addition, the Hypergolic Storage Facility is used to store significant quantities of the toxic nitrogen tetroxide, which is included in this Risk Management Plan in accordance with the General Duty Clause: Section 112(r)(1) of the Clean Air Act"

The implementation of the AFIMS on Vandenberg AFB is detailed in the 30th SW Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP 10-2).\r\n  \r\nVandenberg AFB possesses significant emergency response capabilities including its own Fire Department, Disaster Response Force, and Security Police Force, in addition to contracted support for handling accidental releases of regulated hypergolic propellants and other hazardous substances.\r\n\r\nThe Vandenberg AFB Fire Department, 30 CES/CEF, is the \"local agency\" that responds as First Responder at the Technician Level to an accidental release of hazardous materials on the base.  This Fire Department comprises some 100 firefighters who staff five fire stations strategically positioned across the base.  One fire station is located within a three-minute response time of the Hypergolic Storage Facility. This Fire Department includes a 5-person \"Hot Shot\" crew that is specially trained to respond to wildland fires. \r\n\r\nThe Vandenberg AFB Fire Department is fully compliant with National Fire Protection Agency standards and has mutual aid agreements with Santa Barbara County, the City of Lompoc, the City of Santa Maria, the California Forestry Department, and the Los Padres National Forest.  The base Fire Department maintains a regular schedule of onsite facility inspections to identify potentially hazardous conditions to include conditions which could lead to an accidental release of a hazardous material.

This emergency response team is capable of handling the hypergolic propellants described in this submittal, and scapesuit-qualified technicians are pre-positioned on location for hypergolic propellant transfer operations.\r\n\r\nThe Vandenberg AFB Command Post is staffed 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and provides a central point of contact in the event of an emergency on the base.  Its extensive suite of communications equipment includes a hotline to Santa Barbara County Emergency Services.\r\n\r\nEmergency response at Vandenberg AFB, which is consistent with the National Incident Management System, is implemented through the Disaster Response Force (DRF)--a management structure of experienced, senior base personnel comprising a cross-section of technical, logistical, medical, and communications expertise.  In the event of an incident involving the release of a hazardous material, on-scene response will be directed by an Incident Commander certified through the Department of Defense Fire and Emergency Services Certification Program to handle such incidents.  Vandenberg AFB regularly exercises the DRF in accordance with AFI 10-2501, and 30th SW IEMP 10-2.\r\n\r\nThe Hypergolic Facility Operations Contractor, United Paradyne Corporation (UPC), maintains an operations-specific Emergency Response Plan (Performance Work instruction PWI-10-S-003H), that specifies Vandenberg AFB and UPC response personnel actions due to: minor and major hypergolic fuel and oxidizer propellant liquid and vapor releases during storage, transfer, and transportation activities; la"

Nitrogen tetroxide is used primarily as the oxidizer component of the hypergolic propellants employed by various space boosters launched from Vandenberg AFB; it is also occasionally used in smaller quantities as a propellant for satellites launched from Vandenberg AFB and in the Propulsion System Rocket Engine (PSRE) of certain ICBMs tested at the base.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of Vandenberg AFB's RMP and CalARP programs--to include OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards and emergency response program planning and training--encompass nitrogen tetroxide storage and operations to the same extent they apply to the regulated hydrazines as described in this submittal.  It should be noted that a review of the base's five-year accident history reveals there have been no reportable accidents involving base employees, contractors, and/or anyone in the general public as a result of exposure to a release of nitrogen tetroxide.  Vandenberg AFB fully intends to maintain every aspect of its current accidental release prevention program as it applies to nitrogen tetroxide as long as significant quantities of this substance are stored or used at the base."
