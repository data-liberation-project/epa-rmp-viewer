Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care ..\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility consists of nine different continuous and batch manufacturing plants producing a variety of end products, including acrylonitrile, acrylamide, methyl methacrylate, melamine, ammonia, sulfuric acid and methanol.\n\nAcrylonitrile, a regulated substance, is used as a raw material to make a variety of products such as plastic fibers, rubbers and fuel mixtures.  Other regulated substances involved with this continuous operation are propylene, hydrocyanic acid, propane and ammonia.\n\nAcrylamide is used to make water treatment chemicals, paper treatment chemicals and oil recovery chemicals.  The regulated substance involved with this continuous operation is acrylonitrile. \n\nMethyl methacrylate is used to make many products such as plastics, floor wax and medical devices.  The regulated substance involved with this continuous operation is hydrocyanic acid.\n\nMelamine is used to make a variety of products such as hard plastics, laminates, microwave plates, flame retardants, spray paints and adhesives.  The regulated substance involved with this continuous operation is ammonia.\n\nAmmonia, a regulated substance, is used as a fertilizer, refrigerant and in household clea"

Another regulated substance involved with this continuous process is a flammable mixture containing  methane and hydrogen.\n\nSulfuric acid is used in car batteries, gasoline refining, fertilizer production, paper production and more.  The regulated substance involved with this continuous process is oleum.\n\nMethanol is used in the manufacture of formaldehyde, acetic acid, antifreeze, paints and more.  The regulated substance involved with this continuous process is a flammable mixture containing methane and hydrogen. \n\nThe Distribution Services Department stores and transports acrylonitrile, as well as transports chlorine, propylene and oleum via railcar within the plant.  All of these chemicals are regulated substances.  \n\nThe Utilities Department uses ammonia as a refrigerant and chorine for water treatment.  Both are regulated substances.\n\n(c) WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the failure of a rail car and the release of 110,000 pounds of chlorine.  The release formed by the evaporating chlorine could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe flammable worst-case scenario is the failure of a storage sphere and release of 6,000,000 pounds of propylene.  The overpressure from ignition of the vapors could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for propylene is the failure of a rail car transfer hose and the release of 25,000 pounds of material.  The overpressure from ignition of the vapors would not reach off-site endpoints and nearby public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia is the failure of a relief valve and the release of 700 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a sprinkler system, an emergency shutdown system and our fire brigade response were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The release formed by the evaporating a"

The mitigating effects of a vapor monitoring system and our fire brigade response were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The release formed by the evaporating chlorine would not reach off-site endpoints and nearby public and environmental receptors.\n \nThe alternative release scenario for hydrocyanic acid is a pipe leak due to thermal expansion and the release of 200 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a sprinkler system, an HCN monitoring system and our fire brigade response were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The release formed by the evaporating hydrocyanic acid could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for acrylonitrile is the rupture of a one and one half inch pipe and the release of 4,000 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a sprinkler system and our fire brigade response were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The release formed by the evaporating acrylonitrile could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for oleum is a leak from a pipeline and the release of 240 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a dike, sprinkler system, neutralization and our fire brigade response were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The release formed by the evaporating oleum would not reach off-site endpoints and nearby public and environmental receptors.\n\n(d) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nCytec's general accidental release prevention program includes:\n\n- EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n- OSHA 29 CF"
