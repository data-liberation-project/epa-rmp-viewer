This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Meeker Cryogenic Plant located in Rio Blanco County, Colorado is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C. and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC\n\n\n\nThe Meeker Cryogenic Plant is an integrated gas processing, hydrocarbon liquid recovery and residue gas delivery facility.  The plant is designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and is assembled from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components and some individual foundation mounted equipment.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  The gas passes through an inlet slug catching facility where liquids that condense in the gas gathering system are separated and stabilized.  The gas from the slug catcher is primarily processed utilizing a turbo expander based cryogenic process to remove recoverable natural gas liquids.  Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems.  A gas dew point control plant, utilizing propane refrigeration to remove a minimal amount of natural gas liquids, is available for "

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\n\n\n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Meeker Cryogenic Plant are residue natural gas (primarily methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and pentane.  These flammables are present in differing compositions in the inlet natural gas,  processed residue gas and recovered liquid hydrocarbon product. A pure propane stream is also present and is used as a refrigerant in the dew point control unit.  Hydrogen Sulfide may be present in the gas processing equipment, but the total quantity that may be on site is below the threshold quantity specified in the RMP Rule.  Field condensate liquids and stabilized field liquid condensate are also collected and stored at the facility prior to stabilization or shipment, but these liquids are exempt from coverage under the RMP regulation due to their naturally occurring nature or low vapor pressure.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Meeker Cryogenic Plant.

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\n\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\n\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident "

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Meeker Cryogenic Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe Meeker Cryogenic Plant conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Meeker Cryogenic Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Meeker Cryogenic Plant has safe work practices "
