The facility is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\r\n\r\nThe Buffalo Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Buffalo Gas Plant is located approximately 14 miles northeast of Midland, Texas on FM1212 and operates the process to produce the following petroleum products:\r\n\r\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas (also known as natural gas liquids)\r\n2. Condensate\r\n\r\nThe products contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include these same components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nSeveral vessels at the plant were evaluated for the offsite consequence analysis.  There is one worst case scenario (WC"

The scenario involves a vapor cloud explosion involving 277,678 pounds (65,336 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in the Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) Product Surge Tank. The entire inventory of this vessel is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and impacting an area with a 0.5 mile radius. The rest of the vessels that were evaluated are located within this radius and have a radius smaller than the WCS vessel discussed.\r\n\r\nThe facility is not located within a populated area; therefore, the WCS would not affect a public receptor and is considered a Program 1 process.  A consideration of the 0.5 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Buffalo Gas Plant is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to aid in accident release prevention.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Buffalo Gas Plant is a new facility.  There have been no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Buffalo Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of Targa Pipeline staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs. However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire depart"

      "SummaryText": "ment to respond.  \r\n\r\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate.  The Buffalo Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \r\n\r\nThere are currently no planned changes to improve safety. Rather, the company believes that diligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework that allows for the continued improvement to the level of safety at the Buffalo Gas Plant. Some of the key components of the program that will help maintain and, where applicable, improve safety are:\r\n\r\nThe Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards. \r\n\r\nThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous release thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\r\n\r\nInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure that we maintain and increase our level of safety protection."
