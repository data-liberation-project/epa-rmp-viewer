Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Green Valley Fertilizer, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of (Substance 1).  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed empergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Grant Fertilizer facility is the storage of fertilizers to our customers.\n\nThe regulated substance, Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and used for fertilizer.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received by rail car and stored on the rail siding at the site.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at Grant is 160,000 pounds per rail car or 160,000 pounds total for a period not to exceed 10 days.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario.  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 160,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Prevention Program.  The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from reactor piping or hoses.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .59 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Ammonia Hydroxide:  The facility has implemented the provisions of the Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 published by the American"

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of near misses of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nHave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nHave resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\nSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specified planned changes to the Anhydrous Ammonia storage or processes at the facility."
