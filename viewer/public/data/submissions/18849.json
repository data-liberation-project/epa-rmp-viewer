      "SummaryText": "The Wilbur-Ellis Company's accidental release program is a priority program for those facilities handling ammonia.  Throughout Wilbur-Ellis Company a comprehensive safety program is in effect which includes training, inspections, safety meetings and management accountability.\n\nThis facility handles anhydrous ammonia for fertilizer use.  The chemicals are stored in above ground tanks.  No other chemical reactions or processes are located at this facility. \n\nThe worst case scenario involves the loss of the largest tank instantaneously.  The offsite consequence will impact the immediate are around the plant.  This was determined using the ALOHA Model.  The alternate release scenario involves the instantaneous loss of five pounds of ammonia  from disconnecting a hose.  \n\nThis facility is covered by OSHA regulations and is visited periodically by other agencies.  There has been one incident involving Anhydrous Ammonia in the last 5 years.   The incident involved the loss of approximately 100 gallons of Anhydrous Ammonia caused by a faulty seal around the pressure gauge.   There were no severe consequences due to this release.  The report is contained in the Risk Management Plan at the facility site.\n\nThe emergency response plan is reviewed and trained annually.  Training at Wilbur-Ellis Company is an ongoing"
