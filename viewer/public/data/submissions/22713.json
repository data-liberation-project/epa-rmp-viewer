This includes reviews by certified refrigeration contractors and registered engineers. This prestartup review is used to determine areas of equipment or operations that may predispose the system to accidental releases.\nA Business Response Plan has been prepared for the facility and will be implemented to include ammonia refrigeration operations. \nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe Taylor Farms facility is located at 1207 Abbott St. in Salinas, California. This facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their cold rooms and process water chilling operations. Figure II-1 shows the location of the facility and Figures II-2 and II-3 show the general facility layout.\nThe refrigeration installation for the facility consists of both fixed equipment and portable skid or trailer mounted equipment. The portable units include  screw compressors and reciprocating compressors along with the associated evaporative condensers and electrical controls. Chiller units with integral low sides are also included in the portable refrigeration system. Fixed components include additional evaporative condensers, high pressure receivers, low pressure recirculators, ammonia diffusion tanks, and fan coils installed in the cold rooms. The portable systems are in place and operating during the salad processing season from April through November. Off-season operation include the Onion Room which is operated off of a portable high-side compressor skid. \nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with "

      "SummaryText": "some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frost bite, redness, pain and serious skin burn.*\n*See Material Safety Data sheet for anhydrous ammonia, (Appendix I).\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nAn offsite consequence analysis for an ammonia release was performed. The release parameters are in Section III. The worst case scenario had a toxic endpoint calculated at 7,000ft (see Section III-C). The residential population affected by this worst case release is estimated to be 4,514 (see appendix F). The alternative release scenario had a toxic endpoint calculated at 300 ft (see Section III-D). No residential populations are affected by this alternative release scenario.\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nWORST CASE SCENARIO - The worst case release is based on the release of the entire contents of ammonia within a ten minute period. This results in a 1,200 lbs./minute release for a total release of 12,000 lbs. The maximum radius of impact is 7,000 ft to a toxic end point of 200 ppm.\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO - This alternative scenario represents a more likely release for the facility. This scenario is based on a high pressure liquid release from a 1/8-inch diameter opening. This represents a potential release from a flange or fitting separation. The maximum downwind distance to 200 ppm is 300 feet for average meteorology.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nRelease prevention is carried out by providing a prestartup equipment inspection. This procedure, performed at the beginning of the season, insures that the equipment is ready to operate and that all safety items have been reviewed. Ongoing maintenance is performed by both on-site maintenance personnel and certified refrigeration contractors.\nAdministrative controls limit the amount of ammonia in the system. A diffusion tank is a system-wide mitigation measure added to the facility. Mitigation  measures are not con"

According to Taylor Farms Personnel, since startup there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nTaylor Farms currently has a Business Response Plan in effect which provides emergency contact personnel information, general emergency response procedures, hazardous material release reporting procedures, chemical inventory information, and emergency evacuation procedures.\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nAdditional risk reduction measures may be implemented to further reduce the potential for an accidental release. These measures may include installation of upgraded piping and equipment supports, installation of equipment labeling, and implementation of program aimed specifically at the maintenance, training, and emergency response procedures for the ammonia based refrigeration equipment."
