      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nWHO IS DSM?\n\nWho is Fibrant, LLC?\n\nThe facility in Augusta was originally a joint venture between DSM of The Netherlands and PPG Industries of Pittsburgh, PA. Founded in 1962, the joint venture's first production facility was a nitrogen fertilizer complex. In 1964, Nipro, Inc., (the predecessor of today's DSM Chemicals) was organized to manufacture caprolactam, a monomer of nylon used in nylon fiber production. Subsequent expansions of DSM Chemicals resulted in two additional caprolactam plants in Augusta, in 1974 and 1976, which made DSM Chemicals the largest independent supplier of caprolactam in the U.S. In 1999 nylon 6 production began at the Augusta site. In 2007 recycling of nylon carpet to produce caprolactam began at the Augusta site. In 2015, the Augusta site entered into a partnership with CVC Capital Partners through a new company ChemicaInvest B.V.  The Augusta site was renamed as Fibrant, LLC.  In 2016, Fibrant, LLC announced the closure of the caprolactam business at the Augusta site.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Fibrant, LLC entered into an agreement to produce ammonium sulfate for Augusta Sulfate Company. Previously a by-product of the caprolactam business, ammonium sulfate will re-enter the market as a stand-alone product. Ammonium sulfate is an inorganic salt with several commercial uses, mainly as a fertilizer in alkaline-heavy soils. Augusta Sulfate Company LLC will re-establish a long term historical ammonium sulfate presence in North America delivering premium quality and service.  Fibrant, LLC will provide the personnel and equipment for the operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFibrant, LLC SHE Policy\n\nFibrant LLC. considers proper SHE management to be a fundamental part of its operations. We have incorporated the main SHE elements in a management system that is based on the ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 standards. Fibrant LLC. SHE policy clearly states the company's commitment to maintaining a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious workplac"

Fibrant, LLC is convinced that all accidents can be prevented. \n\nA?no occupational diseases or health problems attributable to Fibrant, LLC's activities.\n\nA?ongoing evaluation and improvement of working methods, processes, products and services to ensure that these are safe and acceptable from the point of view of employees, customers, the community and the environment.\n\n\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives we have laid down a number of principles that apply throughout the Fibrant LLC. organization:\n\n\n\nA?SHE management is just as important as production, marketing, profitability and product quality. \n\nA?The Fibrant LLC. site is subject to regular audits.\n\nA?Fibrant LLC. reports on its SHE performance.\n\n\n\n \n\nWhat Does Fibrant, LLC Mean To Augusta? Augusta Sulfate Company, LLC?\n\nThe Fibrant, LLC plant facility in Augusta mean jobs for approximately 75 persons, with a payroll in excess of $5 million and tolling revenue of $11 million. Augusta Sulfate Company, LLC has total sales of $40 million. Fibrant, LLC is involved with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\n\nOleum\n\nBasic Information\n\nA?Oleum, also known as fuming sulfuric acid, is basically a clear liquid with a slight milky-gray tint and a severely irritating odor. Exposure to the liquid causes tissue destruction. Oleum is a severe fume hazard. The fumes are sulfur trioxide, are severely irritating and concentrations over 3 ppm are harmful.\n\nA?Oleum is used as a sulfating agent, dehydrating agent, in dyes, in explosives, and in petroleum refining. \n\n\n\nAt Fibrant, LLC Oleum is neutralized with ammonia hydroxide, and converted to ammonium sulfate, a fertilizer.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History\n\nThere were no reportable releases of oleum in the last five years. We have had ten accidental releases of oleum in the past five years totaling 761 pounds. The largest release was 400 pounds. There were no on-site deaths, injuries, or signific"

Ammonia is very irritating to mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Direct contact with liquid ammonia can cause severe burns. The vapor is extremely irritating and concentrations over 200 ppm are harmful.\n\nA?Ammonia is one of the most commonly used chemicals in the United States for a variety of industrial, commercial and agricultural purposes. Fibrant, LLC uses it as a raw material to produce aqua ammonia.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History\n\nWe have had 28 accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years. The largest release was 980 pounds. There were no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, and there were no offsite effects from these releases.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Accidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nA?Ammonia inventory was minimized by the removal of an ammonia tank. Inventory is limited to the contents of piping from our supplier, PCS Nitrogen, located close to our plant.\n\nA?A piping inspection program is utilized to monitor the condition of ammonia piping and repairs are made as determined by these inspections.\n\n \n\nAqua Ammonia\n\nBasic Information\n\nA?Aqua ammonia is also known as ammonia water, ammonium hydroxide and household ammonia in very dilute solution. Aqua ammonia is a colorless liquid with a strong characteristic odor. Concentrations of solution range up to 30% ammonia in water. "
