In addition, ADM continually evaluates options at its facilities for replacing hazardous materials with less hazardous or non-hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nBoth facilities employ specific safety precautions in handling hazardous chemicals to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community and the environment.  Both facilities adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safe operations are the result of the following: precautions used in handling hazardous chemicals, personnel training, and the engineering of inherent safety features in the design of equipment.\n\n \n\nEmergency response for the ADM East Complex is coordinated with ADM personnel and the Decatur Fire Department.  The program includes procedures for notifying the appropriate personnel and agencies in the event of an accident involving a hazardous chemical.    \n\n\n\n The regulated substance used at ADM's East Complex is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is received by truck and rail and stored in three storage tanks.  At the BioProducts facility, anhydrous ammonia is used as pH control and a nitrogen source for product fermentation.  At the ADM Cogeneration facility, anhydrous ammonia is utilized to reduce emissions of  nitrous oxides.    \n\n\n\nThe key concepts in the BioProducts and Cogeneration prevention programs are the elements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) programs at each facility: employee participation, process safety information, analysis of hazards, operating procedures and safe work practices, personnel training, contractor programs, pre-startup reviews, maintenance and mechanical integrity programs, hot work permit proce"

Neither the BioProducts nor Cogeneration facilities have experienced any accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that have required reporting in the past five years.  Therefore, neither facility has experienced an accident that has resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n                                                                                                                                                                \n\nThe ADM BioProducts and Cogeneration facilities each have Emergency Response Programs and Emergency Response Plans for responding to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  As part of this program, ADM has trained personnel as Hazardous Materials Technicians who can take measures to mitigate accidental releases.  The Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with ADM personnel and the Decatur Fire Department such that, in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures can be implemented.  ADM works cooperatively with the surrounding community and the Decatur Fire Department to improve response capabilities.  \n\n\n\nAs a result of each facility's process hazard analysis review, it has been determined that no changes need to be made to the system at this time.  However, ADM will continue evaluating options for improving processes and efficiencies in order to reduce the quantities of hazardous materials used and stored at its facilities."
