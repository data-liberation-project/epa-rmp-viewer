(a)  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.  The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association management and employees of the Mellette, SD facility have implemented a variety of standard operating procedures, safe work practices, training programs, and maintenance procedures designed to protect people, property and the environment.  The facility complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) - 58 requirements for Liquid Propane Gas Storage and Handling, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  In the event of an emergency accidental release, it is the policy of the management of the Mellette, SD facility to notifythe City of Mellette Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency situation.  (b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled. The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association Mellette, SD facility stores and handles a variety of products and commodities associated with the production of crops.  Anhydrous ammonia and liqified propane gas is a product regulated by Part 68 of the CAA and are in use at this facility at regulated quantities.  Anhydrous ammonia, for retail sales, is stored in one above ground storage tank (AST) on a concrete cradle. Incoming prduct arrives by semi-bulk trucks. The facility also has 13 nurse trailers that allow farmers to supply nitrogen to the field.  Liquified propane gas, for crop drying, is stored in one above ground storage tank (AST) on concrete cradles.   Incoming product arrives by bobtail trucks.

In our emergency planning we have considered two scenarios for each chemical,  these involve a worst case release scenario and a more likely but still uncommon alternate scenario.  The worst case scenarios involve the release of the entire contents of the largest tank of anhydrous ammonia or liquid propane tank.  The alternative scenario for anhydrous ammonia involve a nurse tank hose rupturing.  The alternative scenario for liquid propane gas involves a transfer hose rupturing.  This planning was aided by RMPComp, a program designed by the EPA that provides conservative results. The population within a radius supplied by each scenario could be effected in the remote chance of a release occuring.      (d) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.      The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association Mellette, SD facility's anhydrous accidental release prevention program complies with the Environmental Protection Agency accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Adminsitrations (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,  American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards and regulations. The facility's liquified propane gas accidental release prevention program complies with the Environmental Protection Agency accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
