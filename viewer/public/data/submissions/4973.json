Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Mobil Chemical Company, Beaumont Chemical Specialty Plant BCS Plant), in Beaumont, Texas manufactures high quality specialty chemicals, such as catalysts, synthetic base oils and lubricant additives.   These products are used in a variety of high performance applications None of these products are considered hazardous by the EPA.\n\n The BCS Plant utilizes certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary on-site human exposure and to minimize the potential for any offsite exposure. These safety precautions include: \n\n7 Effectively managing our process operations;\n7 Investing in the latest process safety technologies;\n7 Training;\n7 Reviewing our processes for hazards on a continuous basis;\n7 Ensuring safety is considered in process design, installation, operations and maintenance; and\n7 Training and maintaining a highly-effective emergency response organization\n\nThe BCS Plant maintains a policy of being a good business partner and a safe, conscientious neighbor which operates its facility in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. \n\nThe BCS Plant has a standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This is evidenced by:\n\n7 our history of support and commitment to the community;\n7 our high environmental standards; and \n7 our participation as a STAR facility in the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection  Program (VPP) since 1986.\n\nWe are proud of our Safety and Environmental Programs"

Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe one covered manufacturing process at the BCS Plant contains one RMP regulated toxic substance, boron trifluoride. \n\n 3.  Hazard Assessment Results\n\nThe RMP rule requires companies to develop chemical release scenarios that estimate the potential community impact from an accidental release.  These scenarios are useful for emergency planning in the event of an accident.  There are two types of scenarios required by the EPA.  The worst-case scenario (WCS) is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance.  It assumes the worst-case meteorology that would allow the release to travel the greatest distance.  The alternative release scenario (ARS) allows industries to develop a more realistic planning scenario.\n\nThere are no covered flammable chemicals at the BCSP plant.  The WCS and ARS for toxic scenarios at the BCS Plant are for the release of boron trifluoride . Offsite impact is mitigated by our prevention programs listed in section one. \n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTo ensure that BCSP's RMP is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to a member of the facility with the necessary background, training, and experience.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated by the Plant Manager, has the responsibility for the development and implementation of our RMP.\n\nThe BCS Plant has developed effective programs to comply with the industry's most stringent environmental, health, and safety standards.  Our plant adheres to the Chemical Manufacturers Association's mandatory Responsible Care. Program.  Mobil Chemical Company was the first in the nation to have all of its facilities, including the BCS Plant, certified as a STAR facility in OSHA's VPP.  Facilities in the STAR program are required to demonstrate"

They are audited by OSHA for compliance every few years.  The BCS Plant was among the first facilities in the nation to earn the prestigious STAR recognition and has maintained it through four OSHA inspections over a thirteen-year period.\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our process management systems address each of the essential features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n- Process safety information                 \n- Process hazard analysis                    \n- Operating procedures                         \n- Training                                                \n- Mechanical integrity                             \n- Management of change                       \n- Prestartup\n- Compliance audits\n- Incident investigation\n- Employee participation\n- Hot work permit\n- Contractor safety\n\nOur risk management program uses these individual elements to prevent accidental chemical releases.  \n\nIn addition to our industry leading management programs, we have designed state-of-the-art systems and equipment to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases. \n\nWe employ extensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of our equipment and safety systems.  Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that may be deteriorating and in need of repair or replacement, before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return equipment to acceptable specifications.    \n\nWe train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made.  As p"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe BCS Plant has had no accidents that meet the criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  \n\n6.  Emergency Response Program Information\n\nThe BCS Plant's Emergency Response Plan serves as a line of defense against accidental releases and other emergencies and the procedure for reacting to accidental  releases and other emergencies if they occur.  The BCS Plant maintains a written emergency response plan at the facility and is included in the community response plan.  The BCS Plant coordinates its emergency response drills with the Beaumont Fire department, the Mobil Beaumont Refinery fire department, various government agencies (e.g., Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, Coast Guard), local hospitals, and the news media.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe BCS Plant is a STAR facility in OSHA's VPP.  We are continually improving our safety programs. We are planning to organize our process safety related procedures into our Process Safety Manual in 1999."
