This program has been prepared to\n\naddress the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities:\n\n\n\nProcess Name Process Chemical Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nP3 - North System Ammonia 28,400\n\nP4 - South System Ammonia 54,000\n\nP5 - Pit Chlorination Chlorine 8,000\n\nP6 - Potato Wash Chlorination Chlorine 4,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of\n\nhazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nGiumarra Vineyards Cold Storage has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and\n\npublic safety. We have:\n\n\n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Giumarra Vineyards Cold Storage business practices\n\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Giumarra Vineyards Cold Storage employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2 PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\n\n\n\nThe Giumarra Vineyards, Packing & Cold Storage facility is a processing facility for potatoes and a cold storage facility for potatoes and table grapes. The facility has two ammonia processes that\n\nprovide refrigeration capacity to multiple cold r"

During these meeting we also discuss\n\npreventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nGiumarra Vineyards Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the\n\npurposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the Giumarra Vineyards, Packing & Cold Storage facility are an integral part of the overall business and operate most of the year. The north system contains\n\na total charge of approximately 28,400 lbs and the south system contains approximately 54,000 lbs. It is extremely important that these systems are maintained and operated in a safe and\n\nefficient manner.
