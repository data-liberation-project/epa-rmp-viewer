This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive Accidental Release Prevention Program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the Anydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System process at our facility.\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we have coordinated Emergency Response procedures with the Cincinnati Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release of ammonia.\n\n\nOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Company uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant for cooling storage rooms, water, and beer in its operation at 1625 Central Parkway.  The Ammonia Refrigeration System consists of a main ammonia receiver tank, seven shell and tube heat exchangers, twenty-five evaporators, an ammonia vapor accumulator, eight compressors and three evaporative condensers.\n\n We only have one (1) regulated substance [Ammonia] present at our facility.  The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 13,200 lbs. recirculated through the various equipment pieces mentioned above.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the Accidental Release Prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with both IIAR and ASHRAE Ammonia Refrigeration Standards.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our Accidental Release Prevention Pr"

The methodology used to carry out these hazard reviews is the HAZOP Methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations and are re-validated at regular intervals of every four to five years.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Samuel Adams Brewery Co. has written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as normal operation, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and normal startup after a maintenance activity.  The information is regularly reviewed by key personnel and is readily accessible to all operators involved with operating the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\nTraining:\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment daily to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  receiver"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Samuel Adams Brewery Co. to manage changes in the process,  technology, equipment and procedures.  Operating Engineers, Maintenance Engineers or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are involved with the Managment of Change Reviews and other employees are promptly made aware of and training is given to deal with the modification(s).\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Samuel Adams Brewery Co..  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing new or modified equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 8 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Our employees are involved with the Process Hazard Analysis, developing maintenance procedures, reviewing operating procedures, and lead the the Management of Change Process.  Our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule.\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion, Samuel Adams Brewery Co. hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Samuel Adams Brewery Co. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of regulated substances occur.\n \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 25 years.  Due to our preventative maintenance programs, daily refrigeration system checks, etc., the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances from our facility within the last 5 years.  \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. has written emergency response procedures to deal with any accidental releases of Ammonia.  The plans and procedures includes all aspects of emergency response including, evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, and adequate first aid and medical treatment.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, on-site emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  \n\nShould outside assistance be required, Cincinnati Fire Department is the primary response organization.
