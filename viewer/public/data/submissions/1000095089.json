During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nWarmerdam Packing has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Warmerdam Packing facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.  \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nWarmerdam Packing has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nWarmerdam Packing's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\nCal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\nCal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR \u00a75189(n)\r\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safe"

The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.403250, -119.740070. The facility is located approximately 4 miles east of state highway 41 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\r\n\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in an area of minimal flood hazard.\r\n\r\nWarmerdam Packing is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that \r\nthere are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Warmerdam Packing has a 1-2% chance of experiencing potentially minor-damage due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\r\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof or in the center hall (catwalk) to provide easy access.
