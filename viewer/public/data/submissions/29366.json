The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR\nPart 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r)(1).  The Prevention Program elements build\nupon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29\nCFR Part 1910.119. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is CAPR's policy to comply with applicable Federal and Puerto Rican requirements.  The\nchlorination process at the Farallon-Cayey Water Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic\nsubstance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of\nchlorine, the Farallon-Cayey Water Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the\nstorage, conveyance and use of chlorine.  The safety precautions are necessary to protect\nemployees, contractors, and visitors at the Farallon-Cayey Water Filtration Plant and the\nimmediately surrounding areas.  Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize\nthe potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency response program for response\nto any chlorine release that may occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Farallon-Cayey Water Filtration Plant supplies water to the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water, destroying microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in ton containers.  The storage building has space for\nup to nine full containers, a total of 20,000 pounds of chlorine.  Chlorine containers are connected\nto vacuum chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate chlorine use.  From the chlorinators, chlorine\ngas is distributed under vacuum "

The chlorinated water is mixed with the water plant flow for disinfection.\n\nWorst -case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined following EPA's Risk Management Program\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The worst-case release scenario is a vapor release of the\nentire contents of a ton container over a ten minute period (200 pounds of chlorine per minute). \nOther worst-case assumptions required by EPA include a low wind speed (1.5 meters per\nsecond), stable atmosphere (Class F), urban topography, and no active mitigation of the release.\n\nEPA requires the determination of the area (zone of vulnerability) which may be exposed to a\nchlorine concentration of 3 ppm or greater.  According to the American Industrial Hygiene\nAssociation, 3 ppm is the maximum concentration of chlorine in air below which nearly all people\ncould be exposed for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on the worst-case\nassumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extend 1.3 miles from the chlorine\nstorage area.\n  \nThe following are known to be within the zone of vulnerability for the worst-case release\nscenario: residences and recreation areas.\n\nApproximately 1,500 residents are located within a 1.3 mile radius of the\nchlorine storage area.  Many of these residents would not actually be impacted in even a\nworst-case release, as the chlorine would travel in the direction of wind.\n\nThe conditions and parameters for the worst-case scenario are specified by EPA.  A more realistic\nalternative release scenario was examined, also following EPA's Risk Management Program\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The alternative release scenario is a vapor release of the\nentire contents of a ton container through a broken 3/8 inch flexible connector tube.  If the\ncontainer was not shut off, the contents would be released at a rate of 21 pounds of chlorine per\nminute over a"

Other conditions remain the same as in the\nworst-case scenario (urban topography and no mitigation of the release).\n\nThe zone of vulnerability for the alternative release scenario is determined to extend 0.1 miles from the chlorine storage area.  Approximately 7 residents are located within a 0.1 miles radius of the chlorine storage area.  These residents and recreation area could be impacted, depending on the direction of wind.  No known environmental receptors are located within the zone of vulnerability.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nCAPR complies with PROSHO requirements for Prevention Programs and for Process Safety\nManagement.  Operators, maintenance staff and contractors are informed of chlorine hazards, and\nhazard signs are posted in the chlorine storage area.  Standard operating and maintenance\n procedures have been developed, and employees who work with chlorine are provided training.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCAPR has an emergency response program.  Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage\narea for early detection and warning of any leak.  Leak repair kits are maintained on site, and\noperators are trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur.  The emergency response\nprogram is coordinated with Civil Defense for notification of the public.\n\nCAPR periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training. All CAPR facilities are scheduled to recieve refresher training by September 30, 1999.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10\npounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site; or known offsite injuries,\nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n"
