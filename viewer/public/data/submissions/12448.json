The City of Roanoke Water Department accidental release prevention policy for Carvins Cove Filtration  Plant involves a comprehensive approach that incorporates technologies, work procedures, and administrative practices.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Virginia Occupational Safety and Health (VOSH) procedures have served as guidelines and standards in the development of this program and are adhered to.  The Carvins Cove Filtration Plant emergency response policy involves the creation of an emergency response plan which will incorporate response capabilities available both internally and from the community.\n\nb. The Carvins Cove Filtration Plant was established in 1946 to disinfect and treat the primary water supply of the City of Roanoke as well as selected areas of other localities.  The Plant is located at 8192 Angel Lane in Roanoke County Virginia.  The water supply is from Carvins Cove Reservoir located approximately one and a half miles from the plant at an elevation approximately 300 feet above the Plant.  The chlorination system includes a chlorination supply room which contains gas chlorine cylinders, the initial components of the gaseous chlorine distribution system, and various safety equipment and an instrument room which contains a flow recorder , various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine actually utilized is two one ton cylinders of chlorine with two additional one ton cylinders connected to an automatic switching mechanism.   There are approximately 10 other ton cylinders in storage.  The facility is manned twenty-four hours per day by water treatment operators, with approximately 15 employees on a daylight shift and 5 employees on the night shift.  The chlorination room is continuously monitored through the use of a control center as well as hourly walk throughs by employees.\n\nc. T"

      "SummaryText": "he offsite consequence analysis includes the consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative release scenario.  The worst case scenario is defined by the Risk Management standards as the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released over ten minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release submitted has been deemed by the City as a scenario  which is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nEPA guidelines and tables were utilized in determining the distance traveled by the \nhypothetical chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.    The residential population affected was determined through overlaying a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance over a map and utilizing U.S. Census Bureau data to develop accurate estimates of the potentially affected population.  The atmospheric data used for both scenarios was that found in the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis literature.\n\nWhen the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a toxic endpoint of 1.71 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of        was obtained.  The EPA defined reduction for the presence of an enclosure of .55 was utilized in deriving this distance.  The alternative release scenario involves the assumed rupture of the flexible connections connected to two ton cylinders through an accidental action of an employee or degradation of the line.  The amount of the chlorine calculated to be released was      lbs. at an average rate over one hour of      lbs./min.  The typical meteorological data used were Stability E, wind speed of 3.0 m/s, average air temperature of 62 F, and 63% average humidity.  The estimated distances to the toxic endpoints was calculated to be .71 miles.  The presence of the enclosure were also considered to derive this distance.\n\nd. The general"
