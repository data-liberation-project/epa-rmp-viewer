As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, and C6+).  The Wilcox plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThere is no worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes at the gas plant.  The plant does not use of store any regulated toxic substances at or above the EPA set threshold levels. \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 process at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulting from a release of 336,000 pounds (100% of tank capacity) of a flammable mixture of liquids from the plant's largest storage vessel (TK-705).  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls, or active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.
