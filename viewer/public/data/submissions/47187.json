The Wawa Dairy Warehouse & Distribution Center (DWD) is located along US Route 1 in Wawa , Delaware County, Pennsylvania. DWD is committed to the safe operation of our ammonia refrigeration system.\nThe system was designed and maintained in accordance with: \n  The American National Standard for Equipment , Design and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems \n  The American National Standard : Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\n  International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Minimun Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia RefrigerationSystem.\n  Guidelines for Ammonia Machinery Room Ventilation.\n  Guidelines for Identifiation of Ammonia RefrigerationPiping and System Components.\n\n- Furthermore,senior management provides the resources ans support necessary to maintain a safe system and ensure appropripate training. The corporate safety policy is to operate an  accident - free enviorment by performing all our work in the safest possible manner. Management is responsible for preventing injuries and every individual associte is responsible for following safe work practices. \n\n- The ammonia system refrigerates our dairy building and automated storage & retrieval system(asrs) . The facility processes milk , juices and teas primarily for the Wawa convenieence stores. Raw product is pasteurized and bottled on the Dairy and finished product is warehoused in the asrs building and then loaded onto our trucks and shipped out to the stores.\n\n-The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system consisits of a single stage system that provides glycol chilling for process cooling , milk cooler ,automated storage and retrivial area cooling and cooling of various tanks and silos. \n\n-Over the past five years we focused on maintaining compliance with OSHA Process safety Management Regulations.

Assocites ( management & frontline ) are consulted on the development and maintenance of all aspects of the PSM program. Furthermore, all information with regards to the ammonia refrigeration system ( prints, policies,etc.) is available to assocites and emergency responders. \n\n-Process Hazard Analysis are conducted to identify , evaluate  and control the hazards associted with the ammonia refrigeration process. A team of assocites with expertise in engineering and process operations,knowledge of processes being evaluated and knowledge of the specfic analysis methods utilized perform the PHA updates and reviews. PHA reviews are conducted in compliance with the Management of Change program. \n\n-The PSM Team developed and implemented standard operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities regarding the ammonia refrigeration system. The procedures include steps for each operating phase  operating limits and safety and health considerations. The team reviews the Standard Operating Procedures annually. In addition, the SOP's are reviewed in coordination with the management of change program.\n\n-DWD implemented a training program that exceeds regulatory requirements. All assocites receive an overview of the system and process safety process management program, as well as annual evacuation training .

Inspection and testing is performed on process equpment , using procedurse that follow recognized and accepted good engineering practices. \n\n- DWD fully evaluates changes to the ammonia refrigeration system to fully assess their impact to associte,community and enviormental safety and to determine needed changes to operating procedures. The managementof changr program requires a four step process: initiation, pre-modification checklist, pre-startup safety review, and a final sign off.\n\n- Pre Startup Safety Reviews ae conducted to ensure new and modified equipment is ready and safe for start up.The Pre Start up Safety Review confirms construction and equipment is designed in accordance with specifications, safety, operating and maintenance procedures are in place and adequate , a process hazard analysis was performed and recommendations were resolved before startup and training was conducted.\n\n- Hot Work permits are issued for hot work operations conducted on or near ammonia refrigeration system. The permits documents that fire preventaion and protection requirments have been implemented prior to the initiation of hot work operations.\n\n- A team of assocites investigates every incident that results in or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release. The Team establishes the root cause of the incident and identifies corrective actions to prevent the incident from occuring again. \n\n-Compliance audits are conducted every three years by a third party consultant in order to verify procedures and practice developed under the standard are adequate, "
