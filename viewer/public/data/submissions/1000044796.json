      "SummaryText": "The Kinder Morgan Transmix, LLC - Indianola Terminal, located in Indiana Township, converts mixtures of petroleum products called transmix back into useful fuel oil and gasoline.  Transmix refers to the small portion of petroleum products that become mixed when different petroleum products are shipped through the same pipeline systems.  Through fractional distillation, Kinder Morgan Transmix Company separates gasoline from fuel oil, converting the transmix back into the same high-quality fuel products that originally entered the pipeline transportation system.  At our facility, the majority of the transmix we process is received via pipeline and the finished products we produce are distributed mainly by tanker truck and pipeline.\r\n   \r\nThe facility uses butane, the specific flammable product defied by EPA as triggering the RMP rule, as an additive or blend-stock during the winter months to increase the volatility of our gasoline.  The butane storage tank is used to maintain a butane inventory. The butane is received at the facility via tanker truck.  Maximum capacity of the butane storage tank is 29,835 gallons or 126,772 pounds of butane. The RMP Program level for this facility is Program Level 3. \r\n\r\nProcess Controls are in place at the facility to prevent or minimize an emergency release. These controls include various automatic and manual shut-offs, alarms, relief and check valves, excess flow devices and grounding equipment.  In addition the facility is equipped with UV/IR detection and LEL/HAM (Hazardous Atmosphere Monitors).\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) was assumed to be the release of the total quantity of the largest storage vessel. The Butane storage vessel holds 126,772 pounds of regulated substance. The WCS submitted is for the release of 126,772 lbs of butane that finds an ignition source causing an explosion. The endpoint (an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch) is 0.40 miles calculated using EPA's RMP*Comp(TM). Under EPA requirements the WCS a"

The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the potential for WCS to occur. MARPLOT was used the estimate the population within 0.4 miles.\r\n\r\nThe endpoint for the Alternative Case Scenario is 0.02 miles.\r\n\r\nThe facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) regulations, including the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Facility personnel undergo operations competency training and testing including emergency response drills.  The response training and drills program includes notification to local emergency response agencies as available during the response training. Agencies also receive applicable SARA Tier II chemical inventory reports annually. In addition the facility is inspected and audited on a compliance schedule according to the PSM requirements.  A Process Hazard Analysis / HAZOP is revalidated at least every five years as part of the OSHA PSM standard.\r\n\r\nThe facility has not expirienced any regulated chemical releases since 2004."
