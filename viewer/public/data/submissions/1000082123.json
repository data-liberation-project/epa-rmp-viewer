The plant produces fresh and frozen seafood products, using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in freezers, chillers and cold storage. Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program  \nSitka Sound Seafoods implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of certain chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds. The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many built-in safety features including high-level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutdowns, and leak detectors.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. There have been no such accidents at this facility.\n\nEmergency Program \nThe facility maintains a written emergenc"
