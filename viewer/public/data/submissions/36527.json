The root cause was attributed to arc gouging during the installation of welded drain nozzles in the year 2000.  As a result of this release, eight plant personnel were hospitalized and subsequently released after observation and treatment. The detection of the incident by the on-site personnel was immediate and the Hazardous materials Hot Line was promptly notified. The water spray mitigation system was used to suppress any vapors, the refrigeration and facility manufacturing system were shut down and secured.  Shortly after the incident began, state and local emergency response personnel arrived at the facility to assess the potential for off-site impact and to provide mitigation assistance as needed.

A conservative estimate shows that about 14,000 pounds of chlorine may have been released due to this incident, exceeding the Federal Reportable Quantity (RQ) of 10 pounds. The corrective actions that were generated from the incident investigation have been implemented, including a detailed analysis to determine the cause of the tube leak, better pumps seals that are more compatible with chlorine, better access to emergency escape respirators, chlorine monitoring devices, improved ventilation to the control room, and other measures.\n                                                                                                                                                                               Incident 2:      On August 13, 2003 an employee was working on de-inventory of the hydrofluoric vaporizer in the reactor to prepare for vessel maintenance.  At the time this work was being performed, the process unit was not in operation due to earlier shutdown on July 20, 2003.  Nitrogen was being utilized to sweep the lines and vessel to a venturi scrubber. The discharged line was plugged allowing nitrogen pressure to in the system to increase.  When the pluggage cleared itself, the increase nitrogen pressure caused the venturi scrubber stick to jump out causing a small vapor cloud and a water spray containing hydrogen fluoride. The operator immediately secured a valve in the system and stopped the release; however, a small amount of liquid contacted his arm.
