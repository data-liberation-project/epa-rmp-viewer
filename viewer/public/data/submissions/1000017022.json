Its committment is exemplified by its overall safety policy which states:\n\n\"No job is more important than the health and safety of our employees, our communities and the environment.\" \n\nThis policy is supported by everyone at Rinchem, but first and foremost by senior management. \n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nRinchem's East Albuquerque Chemical Warehouse at 6139 Edith Blvd. NE stores chemicals for the semiconductor industry.  There is only one substance regulated under 40 CFR part 68 - 37% hydrochloric acid - that is stored above the threshold quantity at this facility.  The hydrochloric acid is not involved with any processes at this location other than handling and storage of closed drums and bottles.   \n\nRinchem is located in an industrial part of town with a mixed residential/commercial population nearby.  The East Warehouse was built taking into consideration fire codes, building codes and industry standards for warehouses that store hazardous materials.  There are many features designed into the building that help to prevent a release of any of the stored substances to the environment such as secondary containment at the docks and dikes in the rooms where the materials are stored.  The materials in the warehouse are segregated by hazard class according to the applicable federal and state regulations.\n\n  \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe three key elements of Rinchem's release prevention program are (1) compliance with federal and state regulations, (2) engineering controls, and (3) dedication to training and safety.\n\nThe areas of compliance include:\n\n     - having an OSHA Process Safety Management Plan for flammables at the facility \n\n     - having a Hazardous Materials Management Plan\n\n     - only accepting materials "

It is Rinchem's policy that any time a release is detected, the supervisor is notified and it is cleaned up immediately by properly trained technicians.  Training is an essential element of Rinchem's prevention program since an informed and trained workforce can prevent most accidents.  The training includes classroom and on-the-job training for \nall new employees as well as annual reviews of the operating procedures with the employees and supervisors who perform the tasks at the facility.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving hydrochloric acid at this facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nRinchem has a comprehensive emergency response plan.  The plan includes evacuation and notification procedures for the employees of Rinchem and for the public.  The facility is included in the written community emergency response plan.  Our employees are fully trained to respond to any release related to the materials stored on-site.  Rinchem's technicians and supervisors attend annual emergency response refreshers where tabletop drills are performed and facility orientation classes are held where evacuation plans and procedures are reviewed.  Facility-wide drills are also performed.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRinchem believes that no changes are necessary at this time to address improvement to safety at our facilities.  Rinchem's procedures, safety policies, facility design and many other preventative measures are adequ"
