      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC is submitting this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update in accordance with the rule.  All accident prevention elements have been reviewed and/or updated.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  The covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\no    Covered Process 1: Railcar Storage (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending (Ammonium Polyphosphate)\n\n\n\nThe Facility coordinates delivery of anhydrous ammonia by railcar and hires a Contactor (A.K.A. Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor - IFRC) to transfer and blend anhydrous ammonia with super phosphoric acid and water to make ammonium polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer.  The APP liquid fertilizer is blended in a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by the Contractor.  The APP liquid fertilizer is not subject to the PSM/RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe railcar Owner or the Owner Agent is responsible for: loading anhydrous ammonia into railcar(s); coordinating with and releasing custody of railcar(s) to a Carrier; and Mechanical Integrity of railcar(s).  The Facility is responsible for: receiving Custody of the railcar(s); storing the railcar(s); and releasing Custody of railcar(s) to either the Contractor or Carrier.  The Contractor is resp"

The worst case release scenario is the same for the both covered processes because the largest vessel (i.e. a 34,000-gallon railcar) is common to both covered processes when connected, and the MPR is not capable of storing anhydrous ammonia.  The worst case release scenario assumes that all the content in the largest vessel (i.e. 34,000-gallon railcar) is released.   The release scenario consists of the railcar being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are different for the two covered processes.  For the Railcar Storage covered process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that an operator fails to fully close the vapor valve on the railcar.  For the Fertilizer Blending covered process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 3-inch liquid transfer hose is severed during the blending process.  The alternative scenario for the Fertilizer Blending covered process considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. excess flow valve or back pressure check valve on the railcar; and emergency shutoff valves on the MPR), and operating procedures that the Facility and Contractor implement to safeguard against ammonia releases from transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Dry Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Dry Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Dry Fertilizer Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly traine"

The PSM/RMP will be updated as the Facility adds, deletes, or makes changes to the process. \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to this Facility.\n\n\n\n"
