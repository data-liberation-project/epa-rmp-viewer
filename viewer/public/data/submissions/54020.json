TBO utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system for process cooling and product freezing.  TBO is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.   This commitment is demonstrated by the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas including: design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance programs, and employee training associated with the regulated process at the facility.   TBO has a policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:  The facility is a commercial bakery that utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system for process cooling and product freezing.  The system is a closed loop process and does not normally necessitate re-filling or unloading of ammonia. Access to the entire facility is controlled and further access to the ammonia process is limited to authorized employees and approved contractors.   Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated RMP substance present at the facility.    \n\n\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:    TBO has an established accident release prevention program that complies with OSHA\u00bfs PSM and EPA\u00bfs RMP programs. The PSM/RMP Prevention Program consists of the following elements:\n\no\tProcess Safety Information\no\tProcess Hazard Analysis\no\tOperating Procedures\no\tMechanical Integrity\no\tManagement of Change\no\tPre-startup Review\no\tHot Work Permits\no\tContractor Evaluations\no\tIncident Investigation\no\tEmployee Participation\no\tTraining\no\tCompliance Audits\n\n4. Five-year accident history:  TBO has not had any reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program:    TBO has a written emergency response plan to assist"

The emergency response program includes all aspects of emergency response including on-scene first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, natural disasters, fires, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The LEPC and local fire department is invited to the facility annually for a review of the hazards at the facility.  The facility conducts annual emergency response drills in conjunction with the LEPC HazMat Team.  \n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:  TBO continuously evaluates the established procedures and equipment in order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner."
