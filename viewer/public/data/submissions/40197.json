Through its members, the company's nitrogen, phosphate and potash fertilizer products reach over a million farmers and ranchers in 48 states and two Canadian provinces.  CF's fertilizer distribution system includes a network of company owned anhydrous storage facilities. The Tampa Terminal, located at the Port of Tampa, was purchased by CF in 1992 and serves as a vital link in supplying ammonia to its own manufacturing facilities and other customers.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nThe Tampa Terminal receives anhydrous ammonia from ships at the Tampa Port Authority's unloading dock. Ammonia is pumped from the ship to an atmospheric storage tank where it is refrigerated to -28 degrees F. Truck and rail loading facilities are on site to load ammonia from the storage tank for transfer to CF manufacturing facilities and other customers. The Tampa Terminal also transfers ammonia to a privately owned pipeline for delivery to other customers. The only substance regulated under EPA's RMP requirements at this facility is ammonia. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices:\n\nThe Tampa Terminal has an extensive safety program that assures compliance with all applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations. The facility operates under a Corporate Environmental Health and Safety Policy that endorses going beyond regulatory requirements when necessary to protect the health and safety of its employees and the public. The design, maintenance and operation of this facility are carried out in conformance with this policy to provide a safe operation and to prevent exposures of our employees and nearby neighbors to ammonia.\n\nIt is the philosophy of CF Industries to conduct its business and operate its facilities in a manner designed to protect the environment and the health and safety of its empl"

CF Industries is equally committed to protecting the safety and health of its employees, and will take all practical steps to eliminate or reduce the exposure of employees to conditions adversely affecting their safety or health while on the job, and encourages off-the-job employee safety and health awareness as well.  The Corporation does not hesitate to go beyond legal requirements if, in its prudent judgment, a higher level of performance is in order.\n\nManagement at each facility is directly responsible for the development and implementation of programs and procedures to ensure conformance with this philosophy.  The programs and procedures are continually reviewed and updated, and each facility is periodically audited to assure compliance. \n\nThe people of CF Industries are dedicated to and trained in the safe operation of the Company's production, storage, and distribution facilities.  However, CF Industries' personnel are also trained in key aspects of emergency response. \n\nThe facility's Emergency Response Plan is based on OSHA's emergency response standard, 29 CFR 1910.120(q). The plan includes procedures for the notification of local fire and emergency response authoriities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility in linked to an alarm and telephone notification ring down system that provides emergency notification to nearby neighbors.  In addition, emergency preparedness is assured by: Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) trained operators and supervisory personnel; emergency response drills with local emergency responders; ammonia sensors located at critical locations in the process area and along the facility perimeter; continous computer monitoring of ammonia sensor readings and weather conditions; and water"

As recognized by EPA, the PSM standard forms the basis for the agency's RMP prevention program component. The primary purpose of this facility's PSM program is to safeguard our employees and nearby neighbors from exposure to ammonia by providing assistance in evaluating and updating the facility's process and mechanical safety procedures and programs.\n\nThe objectives of the PSM program are:\n\n1) To periodically review and update the facility' process/mechanical safety procedures and programs;\n2) To provide for regular and periodic review of the faciity's procedures to maintain compliance with OSHA's PSM regulations;\n3) To perform Process Hazard Analyses on new and existing processes; and\n4) To assure follow up on the action items generated by the Process Hazard Analyses \n\nKey mechanisms are:\n\n1) A comprehensive tank inspection program requires the storage tank to be emptied and inspected;\n2) The Terminal has automated emergency shutdown systems with isolation valves to minimize a potential release;\n3) Continuous monitoring and surveillance are conducted by operating personnel via computer and remote cameras\n4) System design incorporates multiple layers of protection including: flare system, emergency power sources, break away protection for trucks and railcars, pressure relief valves, and leak detectors;\n5) Plant personnel receive Process Safety Management training;\n6) Traffic is strictly controlled throughout the facility; and\n7) Site access is controlled and monitored\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nIn the past five years there have been no ammonia releases that caused injury or property damage either onsite or offsite.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nHAZMAT training is performed in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and pre-emerg"
