The owners, management and employees of the Columbus Water Reclamation Facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hazardous materials.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Platte County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the processing of wastewater prior to its discharge to public water ways.\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The City of Columbus has developed a Prevention Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for a Program Level 2 facility.  The City has implemented procedures that require frequent evaluation and updating of our safety and prevention procedures as needed.\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History.  No accidents, as described in 40 CFR Part 68.42(a) have occurred at the Columbus Water Reclamation Facility during the past five years.  This successful operating record is due to the City's commiitment to ongoing training programs, operating procedures, and  computer-generated maintenance activities.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.   The emergency response program established by the City of Columbus for this Water Reclamation Facility does not require our personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The local emergency response agencies will be relied upon for coordinating all response actions resulting from the release and for informing the public about the release.  The facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan outlining actions taken in the event of an accidental release of regulated substances as well as in the event of natural disasters.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no"
