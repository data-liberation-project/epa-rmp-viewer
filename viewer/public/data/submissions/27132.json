      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY for Goodland Agronomy\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of IMPACT LLC, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, LEPC, or other agencies, to control any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people, property and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at Goodland Agronomy is the storage and blending of fertilizers for custom application and re-sale to crop producers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. \n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 416,000 pounds in our two bulk storage tanks totaling 60,000-(30,000 gal per tank) gallons, plus 39  48 wagon type nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of  a semi-transport trailer holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our 30,000-gallon storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which is the volume of one 30,000 gallon storage filled to 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.10 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a 3 inch transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles. \n\n4. The accident release prevention program\nGoodland Agronomy has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety an"

The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n     - have caused any death, injuries, property damage at this facility; nor to our knowledge have resulted\n        in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nThe facility has:\n\n   a. A written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standards 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n   b. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information  \n      as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n   c. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard  29 CFR 1910.120,\n       including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
