      "SummaryText": "Cessco is a small aerosol filling company located on rural Johns Island, S.C.  Currently Cessco\nemployees nine (9) people including management and owners.  When Cessco relocated its plant \nfacilities in 1991, it sought an isolated location.  In determining the propellant tank location sites, \nthe tanks were placed at the furthest possible distance from homes or offices.  Being a small, \nclose knit company, management makes every effort to provide a safe working environment.  \nMonthly safety meetings are held and management and plant personnel interact equally.  Every \nemployee has received and been certified in Hazardous Materials HM0181F/126F Training.  \nLast training and certification was completed on July 13, 1999, on site by HAZCOM of Salem, \nVirginia.  Cessco also receives regular courtesy visits from the St. Johns Fire Department as the \nfire department periodically uses Cessco's plant and grounds for the training of their new \nfiremen.\n\nCessco manufactures insecticide aerosols, insecticide liquids, and liquid cleaning products.  \nCessco formulates and fills its own EPA registered products and also contract fills for other \ncompanies.  All products are formulated from EPA approved Confidential Statements of \nFormula. The concentrated active ingredients used in various formulas are pyrethrum, piperonyl \nbutoxide, d-trans allethrin, permethrin, tetamethrin, chloropyrifos, and DDVP (vapona).  These \nactive ingredients are blended with solvents, those being Isopar M, LPA 210, BVA KX45, \nExxate 1300, Odorless Mineral Spirits, Hi-Sol 10, and Sponto AK 3138.  Propellants used to fill \nthe aerosols are HFC-134A (non-flammable) and Hydrocarbon A-70 (flammable).  All of the \nchemicals except for 134A and A-70 are brought into the plant in 5, 30, or 55 gallon containers.  \n134-A and A-70 are received in bulk and put into storage tanks located on the northeast side of \nthe plant property.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be if the propane tank was filled to 19,000 pounds an"

Using Table 3 of the Risk Management Program Guide Book, \nNOMINAL TANK CAPACITY VERSUS DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT, the furthest point \naffected by the vapor cloud would be .2 of a mile.  As part of our Emergency Response Plan, the \nSt. Johns Fire Department would be contacted immediately and their response time would be \napproximately five (5) minutes.  Upon arrival they would cover the vapor cloud with a water \nmist that would help keep the cloud visible and allow them to track the cloud.  The above \nscenario is unlikely to happen because the pressure relief valve is rated at 250 PSI (tested even \nhigher) and the actual tank pressure rarely reaches 80 PSI.  As for failure of the relief valve, the \nNFPA 58, Appendix E 23.1 (d) states pressure relief valves have excellent safety records so \nmechanical failure would be unlikely.  The pressure relief valve was installed and tested in 1995 \nbefore the tank was put into service.\n\nThe alternative scenario that could occur would be for the propane tank man-way gasket to fail.  \nIf this should happen and the propane tank contained 19,000 pounds there would be no way to \ncontain the propane and keep it from escaping.  A vapor cloud would be produced and would \ntravel .2 of a mile to its endpoint.  As part of our Emergency Response Plan, the St. Johns Fire \nDepartment would be contacted immediately and their response time would be approximately \nfive (5) minutes.  Upon arrival they would cover the vapor cloud with a water mist that would \nhelp keep the cloud visible and allow them to track the cloud.  This scenario is unlikely to \nhappen because in 1995 before the tank was put into service, a new stainless steel man-way \ngasket was installed and thoroughly pressure tested.\n\nCessco currently complies with the rules and regulations set forth by the EPA, DOT, OSHA, \nDEHEC, and local agencies.

      "SummaryText": " The Accidental Release prevention Program focuses on repeatedly \ntraining employees, (e.q. daily hands on training.)  Before any start up of equipment, it is \nrequired that all pumps, compressors, pressure gauges and pressure relief valves be inspected.\nBack-up and prevention systems are as follows:\n    \n1) Emergency shut-off systems for electrical, piping, and pumps. \n2) Backflow prevention valves.\n3) Excess flow valves.\n4) Pressure relief valves.\n5) Breakaway piping.\n6) 20 PSI blow out panels.\n7) Sprinkler systems.\n\nCessco has had no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nCessco's Emergency Response Plan is coordinated directly with the St. Johns Fire Department \nand HAZMAT Response Team.  The nearest fire department is 2.5 miles away and response \ntime is five (5) minutes or less.\n\nCessco will continue hands on training of its personnel and monthly safety meetings.  There are \nno changes planned for the emergency shut down and prevention systems that are in now in \nplace.  Our biggest challenge is keeping up to date on the many rule changes that take place with \nthe various government agencies.  Plans are in process to contract with a consultant in \nOccupational and Environmental Health and Safety to assure that the company stays up-to-date \nand in compliance with the rules and regulations of EPA, DOT, OSHA, DEHEC, and local \nagencies."
