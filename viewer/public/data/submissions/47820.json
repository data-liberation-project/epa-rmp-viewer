It is the policy of this facility to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Management, and employees are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, county LEPC, EPA, and any other applicable authorities to mitigate the release and minimize its impact on people and the environment.  \n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substance handled:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, filled into nurse tanks, and sold to the customer for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility has implemented the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the standards of the  U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \u00bfStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00bf.  \n\nThe five-year accident history:  There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that has caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.  Neither has there been a release that, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\nThe emergency"
