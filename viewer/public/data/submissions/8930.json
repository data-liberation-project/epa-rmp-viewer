During the entire transfer operation,  the truck driver will be present to monitor the transfer and to take corrective action if required to minimize releases.  Unauthorized personnel {i.e., customers/ visitors) will not be allowed in the immediate area during the transfer operation.  The pump and compressor methods are essentially-identical, except that the pump method pressure in the two tanks is equal throughout the process.\nBefore attaching any hos"

Goggles and gloves will be worn at all times during the transfer operation.  The following is the step-by-step procedures for tanker truck  delivery procedures:\nTANKER TRUCK NORMAL DELIVERY PROCEDURES\n1. Before beginning the transfer process, the truck driver checks the conditions of all required safety equipment.  All equipment must be in good conditions before proceeding.  Required personal protective equipment {PPE} will be worn throughout the procedure.\n2. The delivery tanker is position properly in relation to storage piping.\n3. Brakes are applied and wheels are choked and engine turned off.\n4. Storage tank contents are checked to assure sufficient capacity remains to hold the contents \n       of the delivery tank before connecting any hoses \n5. All delivery tank and storage piping system valves are confirmed closed.\n6. All hoses, hose connections, couplings and gaskets are inspected and cleaned.  Check for defects, cracks or excessive wear and replace all worn or missing gaskets.\n7. Inspect transport hoses and ensure that they are free of defects and do not have any kinks or short bends.\n8. Confirmed all bleeder valves are closed.\n9. Vapor and liquid hoses are connected, making certain that all connections are straight and tight.\n10. Pressure in both the delivery tanker and storage vessel are checked.  Pressure in both tanks should be approximately equal at this point.  Remember to open all valves slowly this will ensure that the excess flow valve does not closes\n11. Open the delivery tank vapor valve and check for leaks, then open the bulk vessel vapor valve between the truck and bulk tank and inspected for leaks.\n12. Open the delivery tank liquid valve first then the bulk tank liquid valves are slowly opened and inspected for leaks.\n13. Before starting the pump, check the liquid in the bulk storage tank.

This prevents possible damage to the bulk tank float on the sight gauge.  The PTO shaft should not be engaged until the valve is complete open.\n14. Once the transfer starts, it is against the law to leave the area.\n15. Fill the tank only 85% full,  Use the fixed liquid level gauge, which is also called the 85% bleeder.\n16. When the transport tank is empty, compressor stopped and all vapor and liquid valves are closed, it is important to open the bleeder valves on the transport vapor and liquid hoses to make sure all pressure is out of each hose.\n17. Pressure from the lines should be released through bleeder valves into a 30 gallon drum of water.After pressure is relieved, bleeder valves are left open and hoses disconnected.  Always point hoses away from you and others in the area because ammonia could be trapped in the hose.  Leave bleeder valves are opened until the hoses are disconnected then close them.\n18. After all hoses and adapters are stowed ensure all acme caps are replaced, locks replaced on bulk tank lines.  A final check is made to assure that all valves are closed and hoses disconnected before approval is given to remove chocks and move tanker truck.\n19. Finally, when it is safe, goggles and gloves are removed.  Personnel protective equipment is to be cleaned{as necessary}and only then properly stored.\nAMMONIA TRANSFER TO NURSE TANK\nThe following is the typical step-by-step procedures for ammonia transfer.\n1.

Slowly open the vapor valves starting at the nurse tank and proceeding along the line through the compressor (if used) to the bulk tank vapor valve, opening each valve as you come to it.\n7. Compare nurse tank pressure with bulk tank pressure.  They should now be equalized.\n8. Open liquid valves, starting at the bulk tank and proceed along the line through the pump (if used) to the tank liquid fill valve.\n9. Start pump/compressor (if used) and make sure the flow starts.  If the flow does not start, recheck all previous steps..\n10. During transfer the law requires you to stay in attendance.  Use this time to check:  safety water on nurse tanks; cover on pressure relief valve; tires on nurse tank; safety chain, hitch pin and tongue and wheel bearings.\n11. When the nurse tank float gauge shows 75% full, open the 85% bleeder valve, making sure the opening faces away from you.  The valve should be releasing vapor at this point.  Watch for the change to a stream of liquid that indicates the nurse tank is at the 85% safe fill level.\n12.

If using a liquid pump:  stop the pump, then close the riser liquid valve, and then close the 85% bleeder valve.\n13. Close the hose-end valve on the liquid line, to allow liquid to drain from the coupling.\n14. Close all liquid valves, then all vapor valves.\n15. Open hose-end of bleeder valves, to clear couplings, then disconnect and store hoses.\n16. Replace acme caps on nurse tank valves.\n17.

      "SummaryText": "NORTHEAST COOP WISNER BRANCH  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.\n\nNORTHEAST COOP  complies with ANSI K-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify DAVID KINDSCHUH CUMING COUNTY CIVIL DEFENSE IN COORDINATION WITH THE WISNER FIRE DEPARTMENT and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of your facility and the regulated substance handled.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed  for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\nThe maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia storage tank is ________61800___ pounds. (Optional)\n\n3.  The Worst-case release scenario.\n\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences. \nThe alternative release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in a transfer hose.  \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The facility has implemented the provisions of  Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.

Excursions beyond these ranges represent abnormal conditions or upset conditions.  We must first recognize what is considered normal operations, to be able to recognize and react to abnormal situations.\nAnhydrous Ammonia (NH3)  is a chemical compound containing the elements nitrogen and hydrogen.  The formula is NH3 indicating that each volume of nitrogen is combined with 3 volumes of hydrogen.  Since the atomic weights of these elements differ, the weight ratio is 82.5% nitrogen to 17.5% hydrogen.\nAt atmospheric temperature and pressure, ammonia is a colorless gas with a very sharp, characteristic odor.  This gas can be liquefied by cooling or by applying pressure."

      "SummaryText": "In appearance, liquid anhydrous ammonia resembles water.  The boiling point at atmospheric pressure is -28 degrees F.  Above 900 degrees F, ammonia begins to decompose, reverting to hydrogen and nitrogen.  At -107.9 degrees F., anhydrous ammonia freezes to form white crystals.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is a relatively stable compound and is extremely hard to ignite.  Ammonia gas is flammable in air in the range of 16%-25% by volume with an ignition temperature of 1562 degrees F.  Conditions favorable for ignition are seldom encountered during normal operations due to the high lower limit, narrow range, and the high ignition temperature required.  However, the release of ammonia gas into a tightly enclosed or inadequately ventilated space may result in the accumulation of a flammable mixture that can cause a combustion explosion if a high temperature ignition source is present.\n(4)  Equipment Specifications\n\nNORTHEAST COOP will strive to keep on record all equipment specifications for bulk storage tanks, piping, pressure relief valves, temperature, pressure, and level gauges, valves, pumps, compressors, and hoses.\n(5)  Codes and Standards used to design, build, and operate our facilities.\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nProcess Safety Information for Anhydrous Ammonia Storage\t\nMSDS for Anhydrous Ammonia\t\nMaximum Intended Inventory\t61800\nNominal Water Capacity of Largest Tank\t12000 GALLONS\nTemperature\tUpper:  ambient max. 110 F         OK\nLower:  ambient min. -15 F\nPressure\tUpper:  240 PSI @ 110 F             OK\nLower:  35 PSI @ -15 F\nFlow Rate\tLoading: 120 G.P.M.\nUnloading:  41 G.P.M.\nVapor Piping\t250 PSIG   OK\nLiquid Piping and Compressor Discharge\t350 PSIG   OK\nSafety Relief Valves\n\n\nRV1\nRV2\nRV3\nRV4\tEach valve relieves    SCFM/air, three are required at all times, a fourth is provided to allow maintenance\nReplaced: ORIGINAL\nReplaced: ORIGINAL\nReplaced: ORIGINAL\nReplaced: ORIGINAL\nInternal Valve\tOK\nExcess Flow Valve\nEFV1\nEFV2\nEFV3\nEFV4\t\nOK\nEmergency Shutoff Valve\nESV1\nESV2\t\nOK"
