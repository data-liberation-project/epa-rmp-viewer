The sensors in the Machine Room will activate the audible and visual alarms in the Machine Room at 25 ppm and a signal is sent to the auto dialer to alert operators.  At 125 ppm, the following actions will take place:  (1) Audible and visual alarms are activated and a signal is sent to an auto dialer to alert operators, (2) Security Link calls the fire department, (3) King valve shut down, (4) Exhaust fans are energized and exhaust is routed from the engine room to the condenser inlet, and (5) The automatic controls energize the condenser fans and water make-up to scrub the exhaust air.  Shutdown occurs at 10,000 ppm which de-energizes all of the equipment in the machine room.  The facility is equipped with three automatic shut off buttons located outside of the Machine Room 2 doors.  If a release were to occur, managers or operators can activate this prevention measure.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history showed that there was one release of anhydrous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years (June 2005 to January 2009).  On August 25, 2008, there was an ammonia release through a relief valve located on the roof at 216 psig and the discharge temperature was 178F for 90 minutes.  Approximately 1,413 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released into the diffusion tank.  This was due to the burn out of the condenser fan which caused the cooling system to fail and ammonia pressure to rise.  Also, the evaporative condenser spray nozzles and filters were clogged and dirty which inhibited the ventilation system.  The water spray nozzles/distributors are not functioning as designed; therefore, the water is not being distributed in a uniform pattern over the coils.  Another contributing factor was that the pressure relief valve activated below the setpoint of 250 psig.  In addition, the emergency exhaust fan"

The ammonia alarm sounded due to a smell of ammonia outside the ammonia room.  All employees at the plant were evacuated and the fire department was automatically notified.  The fire department arrived and assessed the situation.  The fire department ordered all persons to stay out of the plant until they gave the all clear.  CSM Bakery Products later called SCS Tracer Environmental, formerly known as Tracer ES&T, to be part of the incident investigation team.  SCS Tracer Environmental recommended CSM Bakery Products to do the following:\n\n1.\tChange the relief valve\n2.\tChange the electrical source to the emergency exhaust fan\n3.\tAdd other computer access location outside the ammonia room \n\nThe facility has completed the following tasks:  1) replaced the electric fan motor was replaced, 2) cleaned the Evaporative Condensers' nozzles and filter, 3) changed the electrical wiring so the the electrical source of the emergency exhaust fan system is independent of the evaporative condenser fan motor, and 4) add computer access location outside of the ammonia room.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCSM Bakery Products has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, facility management will determine if an evacuation is necessary.  It is the policy of CSM Bakery Products to evacuate the employees and call 911 in order to reach the San Bernardino County Fire Department HazMat team who will respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel). \n\nEmployees and contractors of CSM Bakery Products are obligated to report any significant releases or potential releases of hazardous materials including ammonia.  \n\nThe Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Response Program section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP (ammonia) documents, which are maintained at the facility and upda"

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n- save lives\n- minimize and avoid injuries\n- protect the environment\n- minimize property damage\n \nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Five Year Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study was conducted on September 7, 2006 and August 13, 2007 for System 1 (1999 System) and System 2 (2001 System), respectively.  The Revalidation Teams reviewed the previous procedural/managerial recommendations made during the original PHA, and made additional recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  As part of the 2006 and 2007 Revalidation, a Seismic Assessment Revalidation and a Hazard Assessment (Off-Site Consequence Analysis) Update were completed.  A Process Hazard Analysis Addendum study was conducted on October 28, 2010 due to the installation of an additional evaporative condenser (EC-4) to System 2.  These technical analyses were reviewed and updated to reflect the current status of the CSM Bakery Products facility.\n\nA Three-Year Compliance Audit was performed on June 10, 2010.  This study consolidated all outstanding recommendations from 2007 PHA Revalidation for System 1, 2007 Three-Year Compliance Audit, and 2008 Five Year Mechanical Integrity Inspection.  The study generated recommendations which mostly involve updating documentation to reflect current conditions and formalizing documentation regarding procedures and practices already in place.  \n\nThe CSM Bakery Products safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the re"

They look to us for excellent value, dependable delivery, consistent formulas and hands-on service. Since our inception in 1971, our simple goal has been to be the most reliable and responsive company in our industry.  The CSM Bakery Products management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surround communities.  CSM Bakery Products' safety and environmental policies are administered by the Plant Manager, who oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program for the anhydrous ammonia systems.\n\nCSM Bakery Products employees conduct ongoing inspections, testing, and replacement of the critical items in the ammonia refrigeration systems and the aqueous ammonia system.  The ammonia refrigeration systems areinspected daily by the Lead Maintenance.  A record of the maintenance or work performed on the systems is maintained onsite.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe CSM Bakery Products facility is located at 2111 West Valley Blvd. in Colton, California.  The facility is located approximately 0.1 mile north of the Interstate 10 and approximately 3.1 miles west of Highway 215.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is primarily urban with light commercial and residential areas.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes are used for the chilling and storage of a variety of food products in their processing area and cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms and to continuous line blast free"

      "SummaryText": "zers.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from 11 Hg to 30 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 150-180 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the two separate and independent refrigeration processes.  The ammonia inventory in the original system is 19,100 pounds, while the second system (July 2001) contains an ammonia inventory of 22,500 pounds. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR), the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.
