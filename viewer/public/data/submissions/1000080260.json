      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Quality Refrigerated Services are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to Implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, We will notify the Clay County Emergency Management Agency and Spencer City Fire Department, which will notify emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass refrigerated storage and handling of meat products.  The plant is located at 225 W 21 street in Spencer, Iowa.  We have one RMP-regulated substance, Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to provide refrigeration for the meat containing areas.  The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is approximately 15638 lb.\n\n\n\n3 The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and EPA Model RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nConsequence modeling was conducted to determine the release distances from the site.\n\n\n\nFor the worst case scenario at this facility, the vessel containing the largest amount of ammonia (the High Pressure Receiver) with a maximum inventory, limited by administrative controls (written operating procedures), of 4,451 pounds was assumed to have released its contents over a 10-minu"

      "SummaryText": "te period.  Release distances were calculated using Class F atmospheric stabvility and 1.5 m/s windspeed, and toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  Results for the WCS were modeled using EPA's RMP-Comp based on a toxic gas release that has been liquefied under pressure, and is located in an enclosed space.  The vessel is located in an enclosed area, the receiver building.  The walls of the receiver building are considered passive mitigation, and reduce the release rate to the atmosphere outside the building.  For a release of a toxic gas in an enclosed space, RMP-Comp assumes that the rate of release to the atmosphere is 55% of the release rate if the release were happening outdoors.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario consists of an ammonia release from a hose leak during ammonia receiver filling operations.  The diameter of the rupture in the hose is 0.50 inches.  The scenario involves a release rate of 463 lbs./minute.  In the event of an actual release, it is expected that an operator would intervene to stop the release within a 10-minute period.  EPA permits the alternative release scenarios to allow the facility to account for administrative controls and mitigation systems that could be used in case of an emergency.  To limit the duration of the release, plant personnel would make use of the following controls and mitigation systems: \n\nOperator detection of an ammonia release\n\nUse of manual isolation valves within 10 minutes of leak detection\n\nEmergency Response capability\n\n\n\n4 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What IF/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and arerevalidated at a regular interval of (five years or when changes dictate).  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Quality Refrigerated Services maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nQuality Refrigerated Services has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at lease every three years and more frequently as needed.  All training will be documented and validated by employee in the QRS Training Tracking System.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nQuality Refrigerated Services carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. "
