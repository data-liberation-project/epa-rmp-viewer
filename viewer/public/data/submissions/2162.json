      "SummaryText": "The BOC Gases Crawfordsville  facility, owned and operated by The BOC Group, Incorporated is located at Route Two, Crawfordsville, IN. The management and employees of the Crawfordsville facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hydrogen.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage of liquid hydrogen and transmission of  gaseous hydrogen to Nucor Steel for their use.  Liquid Hydrogen is received and stored in a 18,500 gallon tank at very cold temperatures (-420 F).  The hydrogen is then sent to a vaporizer where the liquid hydrogen is changed into a gas and then delivered to Nucor Steel for their use. \n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, would be the rupture of the 18,500 gallon Liquid Hydrogen Tank. The results would be a maximum release of 10,900 lbs of  hydrogen over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of  1 psi overpressurization from a Vapor Cloud Explosion was determined to be 0.24 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and urbanl topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect 9 residents and no special receptors based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land View III\".  One industry ( Nucor Steel) is also within the endpoint.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe alternative release, or more probable, scenario which was determined involved the rupturing of the  fill hose during filling of the tank from a road trailer. This release would result in the 10 second release of  55 lb. of liquid hydrogen prior to the activation of the emergency shut-off valve. The Emerge"

The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would include one business/industry Nucor Steel but no several public receptors or residents. There were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, and Emergency Shut-off Valves on the Delivery vehicle and tank,  a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hydrogen.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the hydrogen system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of hydrogen. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process.

The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review on December 8, 1998 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA's hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.  Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening.  In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.  The employees  are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed on February 22, 1999.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.

In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in October 28, 1998.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted on May 3, 1996.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process, or handle hydrogen has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.  The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer's recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation. This program was review on February 22, 1999.\n\nHazardous work or nonroutine work is controlled in a consistent manner.

This Program was review in November 28, 1998 for both employees and contractors.\n \n\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\".  A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.  Management of Change procedures were review in August 1998.\n\nProcess incidents which result in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of hydrogen are investigated, including \"near misses\", within 48 hours of the incident.  The purpose of the incident investigation is to identify the underlying causes of the incident and to implement corrective action to prevent similar incidents and avoid past mistakes.  Process incidents are investigated by a Team which include both management and employees and is multidisciplinary.
