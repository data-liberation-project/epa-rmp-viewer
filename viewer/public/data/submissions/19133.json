If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to respond with the Henry County Fire Department.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substance handled.  This facility is a manufacturing plant.  We manufacture Thermco. Foamed-In-Place Insulation for sale to certified dealers in the US.  We use the 37% formaldehyde to manufacture this particular product.  We have two (2) reactors located at the North end of the manufacturing plant with a 46,000 pound storage tank being located on the West side of the manufacturing plant.  The front = of our building is storage and office space.\n\nThe worst cases release scenario.  Our worst-case scenario is the failure of one of two reactors or a leak of the storage tank, resulting in an outside air release of .168 pounds per minute.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is .1 miles or .2 kilometers, with a total population of 14 people.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  \nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nFive-year accident history.  We have never had an accident involving the 37% formaldehyde that has caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program.   In the event of an emergency involving the failure of the reactors or holding tank of 37% formaldehyde, it is our policy to contact the Henry County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.   None"
