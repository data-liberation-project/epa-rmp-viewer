      "SummaryText": " efficiency and resource conservation throughout the value chain.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION:\n\n\n\nThe Milwaukee Plant manufactures chemical additives used in the pulp and paper industry, and uses epichlorohydrin in the production of wet-strength resins.  These resins are used in paper towels, napkins, tissues, etc. so that they will not come apart easily when wet.  Epichlorohydrin is a raw material for the process and is consumed in a chemical reaction to make the product.  The plant receives epichlorohydrin in tank trucks and railroad tank cars and stores the material in a storage tank.  The storage tank is provided with a containment dike and leak detection to minimize adverse impacts from any potential leaks, releases or spills.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Solenis Milwaukee facility complies with the OSHA PSM rule.  As a PSM facility, Solenis completes a detailed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) every 5 years.  The PHA seeks to identify and address potential causes of incidents before they occur.  In addition, PSM training on safe handling of equipment and chemicals is conducted every three years for all Kymene area operators and all maintenance mechanics.  Management of Change (MOC) procedures are followed to ensure that any changes that occur in the Kymene process do not have the potential to result in an increased risk of a safety incident or an accidental release. In addition, routine maintenance is conducted under the facilities preventative maintenance program to ensure that equipment critical to the safe handling of epichlorohydrin is maintained in good condition at all times. System interlocks ensure that incompatible chemicals are not mixed together.  \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of epichlorohydrin in the last 5 years that meet the criteria for inclusion in the 5-year incident history.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Milwaukee Plant has a written emergency response plan and coordinates "
