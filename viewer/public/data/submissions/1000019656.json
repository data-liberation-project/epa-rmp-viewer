The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook.  The worst case release scenarios are highly unlikely to occur because of active and passive mitigation measures that are available and used, and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled for both of the CalARP/EPA RMP Program 2 substances: anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.  The meteorological conditions specified by Sacramento County and consistent with regulatory requirements for alternative release scenarios were used.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distances for the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia scenarios.  The theory behind the CAMEO Evaporation Calculator was also used for the aqueous ammonia scenario.  The downwind distances for these alternative release scenarios are significantly less than that for the worst case scenarios.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook. \r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and facility personnel that make this worst case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia"

      "SummaryText": "Wilbur-Ellis Twin Cities facility is located in Elk Grove, California, approximately 15.5 miles south of the Sacramento Executive Airport off the I-5 freeway.\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed a Risk Management Program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785), and Environmental Protection AgencyA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan requirements (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Chapter 1, Part 68).  The facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facility staff is highly trained and utilizes log sheets and employee rounds to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe facility has a long standing commitment to its workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia systems.  The facilityA\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable standard operating procedures and maintenance tasks to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe anhydrous and aqueous ammonia are received, stored, and distributed directly to area farmers for the direct application as an agricultural nutrient.\r\n\r\n \r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per CalARP/EPA RMP regulations a worst case analysis has been defined for the anhydrous ammonia system and the aqueous ammonia system.  The meteorological conditions specified by Sacramento County and consistent with regulatory requirements for worst case scenarios were in"

Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with:\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia\r\n- Process valves permit isolation of any leaks in place without exposing anyone to the anhydrous ammonia.\r\n- Remote shut-off device actuates anywhere along the length of the system, and closes the vapor and liquid lines.\r\n- Barriers around the tank and hose connections protect against vehicular impact.\r\n- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia\r\n- Process valves permit isolation of any leaks in place without exposing anyone to the aqueous ammonia.\r\n- Containment area present during transfer operations.\r\n- Ballards protect the tank from vehicular impact.\r\n- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP/EPA RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  As ammonia is A\u00bfself alarmingA\u00bf due to its pungent odor, even minor releases are readily noticeable.  \r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program 2 elements applied to the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia processes include:\r\n- Safety Information\r\n- Hazard Review\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\n- Training\r\n- Maintenance\r\n- Compliance Audits\r\n- Incident Investigation\r\n- Emergency Response\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no CalARP/EPA RMP applicable releases of anhydrous ammonia at the facil"
