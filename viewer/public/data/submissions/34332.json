Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy:  The location and design of this system complies with the Ohio Administrative Code 901:5-3-01 to 901:5-3-14, ?Regulations for Storing and Handling Fertilizer Anhydrous Ammonia?, as administered and enforced by the Ohio Department of Agriculture.  It is the policy of this facility to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Management, and employees are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, county LEPC, EPA, and any other applicable authorities to mitigate the release and minimize its impact on people and the environment.  \n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substance handled:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, filled into nurse tanks, and sold to the customer for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the standards of the  U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia?.  \n\nThe five-year accident history:  There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that has caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.  Neither has there been a release that, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\nThe emergency response program:  The facility has a w"

The local fire department has been on site for safety and emergency response training.  The facility submits annual community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed by company personnel and by the Ohio Department of Agriculture to assure the safety of equipment and procedures.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
