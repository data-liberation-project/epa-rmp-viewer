There are procedures that address maintenance, inspecting, testing, and using the critical equipment needed in an emergency. Employees receive periodic training in the duties they are expected to perform during an emergency, and any change in the emergency response plan is administered through the management of change process so that affected employees are notified.  \r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan is coordinated with local emergency responders. This includes periodic meetings among community responders and facility representatives so that they are aware of the  hazards of our processes. Communication channels with local responders are kept open 24-hours per day. This coordination and communication ensures that the public is quickly notified, if necessary, and that action is promptly taken to minimize the consequences of a release. We periodically conduct emergency response drills so that all participants are familiar with their duties during an emergency.\r\n\r\nERCO maintains a Citizens Advisory Panel (CAP) to gather public input regarding our operations. This includes growth plans, transportation issues, public safety, and our emergency response plans. Members of the CAP at this time include members of the local chamber of commerce, retirees from ERCO and other local businesses, business owners, and neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nERCO continuously strives to improve the safety of our processes. Suggestions for improving safety are regularly addressed through process hazard analyses, management of change procedures, incident investigations, and employee suggestions.\r\nThe following capital improvement projects have been approved and are being implemented:\r\n1) Upgrade chlorine compressors;\r\n2) Upgrade NaCl anolyte piping; and\r\n3) Install new EVS cooler."

In addition to the prevention program, ERCO has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public, and the environment. These features may contain or control a release, detect a release, or reduce the consequences of a release. They may also prevent a release by providing strict design standards for process equipment. The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility:\r\n1) Release detection\r\na. Chlorine detectors in the production, storage and loading areas\r\nb. Video surveillance of the loading/unloading area\r\nc. Procedures requiring that plant operators inspect their work area on a routine schedule\r\n2) Release containment and control\r\na. Valves to permit isolation of the process\r\nb. Automated shutdown systems for some process parameters (e.g. high level, high pressure)\r\nc. Manual shutdown systems located in the control room\r\nd. Pressure relief valves and rupture disks\r\ne. Excess flow valves on the chlorine storage tanks and rail cars\r\n3) Release mitigation\r\na. Fire suppression equipment, pre-connected fire hoses & fire extinguishers are located throughout the plant\r\nb. Trained emergency response personnel\r\nc. Personal protective equipment (e.g. protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\r\n\r\nXVII. Five-Year Accident History\r\nThere was one incident in the past five years that resulted in equipment damage and a 60 lb reportable chlorine release.  There were no on-site or off-site injuries or environmental damage as a result of this incident.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Emergency Response Program\r\nERCO maintains a written emergency response plan that is designed to protect employees, the public, and the environment.

      "SummaryText": "V. Contractors\r\nERCO uses contractors for various activities, such as maintenance and construction. All contractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well trained and are able to perform their job function in a safe manner. A contractor's safety record and performance are reviewed during the selection process.  Once a contractor is selected, the ERCO Worldwide-Port Edwards Plant provides training and procedures to ensure that contractor employees:\r\n1) Perform their work in a safe manner,\r\n2) Are aware of the hazards associated with the area in which they will be working,\r\n3) Understand the emergency response procedures, and\r\n4) Report any hazards they find during their work.\r\n\r\nERCO personnel periodically monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nXV. Compliance Audits\r\nCompliance audits are performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively. ERCO performs Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) of all manufacturing processes at the plant, not just those required by EPA and OSHA. This process combines plant-specific and process-specific knowledge of ERCO's engineers, supervisors, operators and maintenance technicians, plus the knowledge base from our sister plants to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation. In addition, an audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with OSHA and EPA regulations and effective hazard prevention. The results of audits are documented and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\r\n\r\nXVI. Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe prevention program previously described ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.

Incident Investigation\r\nERCO trains its employees to promptly investigate each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, injuries to employees, the public, or impact on the environment. Incident investigations are designed to determine the facts, identify the root causes, and provide recommendations for ensuring that the incident does not recur. Corrective actions resulting from an incident investigation are tracked until they are resolved. Some examples of changes made as a result of incident investigations include developing new procedures or revising existing ones, changing equipment construction material, or requiring additional monitoring.\r\n\r\nXII. Employee Participation\r\nERCO encourages employees to be involved in every aspect of process safety management and incident prevention. Employees are routinely asked to participate in process hazard analyses, incident investigations, management of change, hazard analyses, and all other aspects of the prevention program. Employees have access to all information developed as part of the prevention program, and are specifically informed of any changes that occur in their process areas.

When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem and try to identify the root causes of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided. Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards required for service in our facility. The mechanical integrity system includes:\r\n1) Inspection and testing procedures;\r\n2) Replacement equipment specifications;\r\n3) Procedures for safe work practices;\r\n4) Maintenance personnel training; and\r\n5) Required documentation.\r\n\r\nIX. Management of Change\r\nERCO reviews any changes to our processes to determine if new hazards are introduced or existing prevention measures are threatened. Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that:\r\n1) New hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system,\r\n2) Safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed,\r\n3) Operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and\r\n4) All training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated.\r\n\r\nThe management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\r\n\r\nX. Prestart-up Review\r\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, ERCO performs a prestart-up safety review. This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves as a quality assurance function by verifying that accident\r\nprevention measures are implemented correctly. Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that:\r\n1) Construction and equipment are consistent with design standards;\r\n2) Adequate operating, safety, and mainten"

Operating procedures are updated following process changes and are annually certified to ensure their accuracy.\r\n\r\nVII. Training\r\nERCO trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks. Employees who are new to a process are given training that includes:\r\n1) A general overview of the process,\r\n2) The properties of the substances used in the process and their associated hazards, and\r\n3) A detailed review of the operating procedures for that process.\r\n\r\nOnce they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks. After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently. Through oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them. Both classroom and on-the-job training are provided. In addition to training in specific job functions, training is also provided on safe work practices. The frequency of refresher training is decided upon with input from our employees and is performed at least every three years. All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training was understood.\r\n\r\nVIII. Mechanical Integrity\r\nERCO maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. Our inspection and testing program is intended to help identify equipment damage or deterioration before equipment fails. Predictive maintenance technologies employed include vibration analysis, thermography, and ultrasonic analysis. Vibration analysis is used for early detection of bearing problems on pumps and motors. Thermography is used to locate problems on electrical equipment. And ultrasonic technology is used to determine the thickness of ta"

Process Hazard Analyses\r\nERCO has a comprehensive program for ensuring that the hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled. Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards. Our hazard assessment focuses on preventing injuries to plant personnel and the community, and preventing adverse impacts to the environment. \r\n\r\nA hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) or a What if?/Checklist is typically used for a process hazard analysis. A team comprised of personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences. The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making recommendations for improvement when deemed necessary. These recommendations are reviewed by management and are tracked until they are resolved.\r\n\r\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every 5 years at a minimum. The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\r\n\r\nVI. Operating Procedures\r\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility. These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as: \r\n1) unit start up; \r\n2) normal operations; \r\n3) temporary operations; \r\n4) emergency shutdown; \r\n5) normal shutdown; and\r\n6) initial start-up of a new or improved process. \r\n\r\nOperating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.
