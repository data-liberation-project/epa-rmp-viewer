Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWater Control & Improvement District No.1 (WCID No. 1) is strongly committed to \n\nemployee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by WCID \n\nNo.1's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as \n\ndesign, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated \n\nwith the processes at its facility. It is WCID No. 1's policy to implement appropriate \n\ncontrols to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur \n\nunforeseeably, WCID No.1 is completely coordinated with the Dickinson Volunteer Fire \n\nDepartment, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and \n\nmitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe facility's primary activities encompass wastewater treatment. WCID No.1 has one \n\nregulated substance present at its facility that exceeds the regulated quantity. This \n\nsubstance is chlorine and is used for disinfection of the wastewater. The maximum \n\ninventory of chlorine at the facility is 16,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nWCID No. 1 has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release \n\nprevention requirements mandated under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The facility is also \n\nsubject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly \n\ndescribe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at WCID No. 1's \n\nstationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nWCID No.1 maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical \n\nhazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Haza"

The methodology used to carry out \n\nthese analyses includes a checklist based on the example presented by the EPA. The \n\nstudies are undertaken by qualified personnel. Any findings related to the hazard analysis \n\nare addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within its covered processes, WCID No. \n\n1 has adopted written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of \n\noperation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency \n\nshutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown. The information is readily \n\naccessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nWCID No.1 has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who \n\nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these \n\nprocesses. Training is provided as frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nWCID No.1 carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper \n\noperations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: \n\npressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency \n\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by \n\nqualified personnel who have previous training in maintenance practices, and are offered \n\nfurther specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the \n\nmaintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nProcedures are in place at WCID No. 1 to manage changes in process chemicals, \n\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that \n\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe \n\nstartup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nIncidental Investigation\n\n\n\nWCID No.1 promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably \n\nresult in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are \n\nundertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective \n\nactions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of \n\nfive years. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nWCID No.1 truly believes process safety management and accident prevention is a team \n\neffort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident \n\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, WCID No. 1's \n\nemployees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation \n\nof the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nOn occasion, WCID No.1 hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and \n\nconstruction activities.
