      "SummaryText": "Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Woodville Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) uses one regulated chemical, chlorine, in the disinfection of municipal wastewater. Chlorine is used in the disinfection of municipal wastewater.  Chlorine is stored prior to and during use in 150-pound cylinders and 1-ton containers on a semi-enclosed concrete pad. The chlorine is stored as a pressurized liquefied gas, and is released into water using a vacuum-regulated system. The 150-pound cylinders are stored at the WWTP pending use in water treatment service at remote well locations that are not subject to the RMP rule. The maximum intended chlorine inventory at the facility is 5,200 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.\n\nPolicies\n\nChlorine is a toxic chemical and precautions must be taken in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to facility personnel and to reduce the threat of accidental release, which might result in exposure to the surrounding community and to the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and industry rules, regulations, and guidelines. Chemical safety at the City of Woodville is dependent upon strict operating procedures, safe handling methods, and thorough training of employees. Chlorine safety devices are also inherent in the design of the facility and in the equipment used in the chlorine chemical process.\n\nWorst-Case/Alternative-Case Scenario Analyses Including Administrative Controls And Mitigation Measures To Limit The Distances For Each Reported Scenario\n\nEPA defines the worst-case scenario as total failure of the largest vessel. The alternative-case scenario is defined as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. The alternative-case scenario should also reach an off-site endpoint, unless no such scenario exists.\n\nAt the City of Woodville WWTP, The worst-case release scenario for chlorine involves the failure of one 1-ton container, resulting in the release of 2,000 pou"

Public receptors would include schools, residences, public recreation areas or arenas, and major commercial or industrial areas.  There were no environmental receptors within the impact radius.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas resulting from the shearing off of the container valve. The distance to the endpoint is 0.2-mile and affects 5 persons.  Public receptors would include residences and major commercial or industrial areas.  There were environmental receptors within the impact radius. \n\nThe City of Woodville limits its inventory of chlorine at the WWTP to two 1-ton containers and eight 150-pound cylinders.  Only one 1-ton container is allowed to be in service at a time, thereby limiting the quantity of chlorine available for release under the alternative release scenario.\n \nPrevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe City of Woodville complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations. Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nSafety Information\n\nThe City of Woodville maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the wastewater disinfection process.\nHazard Review\n\nOur facility conducts detailed studies to ensure that the hazards associated with our chlorine process are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies are undertaken by qualified personnel and are revalidated at least once every five years. Findings related to the Hazard Review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities with"

      "SummaryText": "in our chlorine process, the City of Woodville uses operating procedures developed to ensure that the 150-pound cylinders and 1-ton containers are not dropped, improperly installed, or otherwise damaged, during the unloading and loading, handling, storage, and use at the WWTP.  These procedures are reviewed and revised as needed to reflect the system configuration, as well as to incorporate improvements or changes in industry and safety codes and standards.\n\nTraining\n\nThe City of Woodville has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees who are operating the chlorine process are competent in the operations procedures associated with the processes. \n\nMaintenance\n\nThe City of Woodville conducts regular maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n \n\nCompliance Audit\n\nThe City of Woodville conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe City of Woodville promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of chlorine. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chl"

As required by 40 CFR Part 68.90, the City of Woodville is included in the community emergency response plan and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe City of Woodville maintains every effort to continually improve the safety of the chlorine process at the WWTP.  The process change from a pressure-regulated system to a vacuum-regulated system was complete in January 2000. There are no additional plans for safety improvements at this time."
