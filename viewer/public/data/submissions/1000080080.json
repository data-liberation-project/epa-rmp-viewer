Chlorine is stored as a liquefied compressed gas in typical one-ton containers at two stations located at the Maerkle Facility:  Lower Maerkle, and Upper Maerkle.  As stated online, \"Carlsbad Water Operations Department is responsible for a variety of behind the scenes services that keep our city running smoothly.  We are \"At Your Service\" and committed to providing top quality service to the Carlsbad community.\"\n\n\n\nCarlsbad MWD's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain safety and environmental programs that promote a safe environment for all employees as well as the surrounding communities.  The Utilities Manager and Water Operations Supervisor are responsible for various inspections of the chlorine facilities to ensure compliance, and to oversee the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP), safe work practices such as Confined Space and Respiratory Protection, manufacturer-recommended maintenance and inspections, emergency response planning with the local fire department and San Diego County HazMat Team, as well as the Risk Management Plan that is also on file with the San Diego County CUPA.\n\n\n\nCarlsbad MWD has an Emergency Action Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document maintained by the department.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  Emergency "

Hazardous Materials training, (Awareness Level, 8-Hour HAZWOPER), is given to all water operations staff.  These operators are allowed to go onsite and assess a potential emergency from outside the stations.  All employees receive specific chlorine-related training during new employee orientation, as well as extensive refresher training that is conducted on a continual basis.  Operators are trained to call for outside assistance (911 and/or San Diego HazMat Team) to respond to a chlorine release.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Carlsbad Municipal Water District Maerkle Facility (5203 Sunny Creek Road, Carlsbad, California) is owned and operated by Carlsbad MWD (5950 El Camino Real, Carlsbad, California).  The facility is located approximately 1 mile north of the intersection of El Camino Real and Palomar Airport Road.  The facility is situated near the boundaries of the cities of Vista and Oceanside.\n\n\n\nTwo very similar chlorine water treatment systems are utilized at the facility:  Lower Maerkle and Upper Maerkle.  The chlorine systems were re-designed in 1995 accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  Each station is equipped with controlled access and security monitoring.  The Water Operations Department maintains a rotating Duty Operator who is on call 24/7 should any abnormal conditions arise.\n\n\n\nThe Maerkle Facility is a 111 acre site that consists of a ten million gallon distribution reservoir, a 600 acre foot long-term storage impound, one pumping/disinfection facility (Lower Maerkle), one impound disinfection facility (Upper Maerkle), related pressure control stations,"

Empty containers are also stored in the chlorine room until being picked up by the chlorine vendor during the next chemical delivery.\n\n\n\nTwo (2) one-ton containers are on-line at any one time where one is in operation and the other is on standby.  The on-line containers are each placed on a digital scale that indicates the remaining weight of chlorine in each of the on-line one-ton containers to allow system operators to monitor usage and plan ahead for ordering more chlorine.  The chlorine system is operated entirely under vacuum conditions with a vacuum regulator attached to each of the one-ton container valves.  Each one-ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  The system connections are made at the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas (not liquid) is drawn out of the container.\n\n \n\nChlorine gas is drawn from operating on-line one-ton container through an automatic switchover / vacuum regulator.  The automatic switchover regulator valves control which container is actively feeding chlorine to the vacuum regulator.  A vacuum (negative pressure) is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum which opens the vacuum regulator.  If a loss of vacuum were to occur in the line downstream of the vacuum regulator, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine gas from escaping from the system.  Any chlorine in the piping upon loss of vacuum (downstream of the vacuum leak) will be drawn to the injection point and into the water solution.\n\n\n\nDownstream of the vacuum regulator, chlo"

Much of the safety design is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the chlorine processes.  For example, the Carlsbad MWD treatment systems operate in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are four mechanisms in the facility to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine gas detectors, 2) visual/audible alarms, 3) emergency chlorine scrubber system, and 4) halogen motorized automatic shut-off valves.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine detectors located in the chlorine rooms at both stations trigger both alarms and shut off actions, as well as notifying the Water Operations Duty Operator.  At 1ppm, the leak detection system activates an audible alarm and triggers the SCADA system to notify the Duty Operator.  At 3ppm, the audible and visual alarms are activated, the motorized automatic shut off valves are triggered to close the one-ton container valve (equipped with battery backup power), the scrubber is activated that draws in the contents of the room to be neutralized, and the SCADA system sends another message to the Duty Operator that the motorized automatic shut off valve was activated.\n\n\n\nThe scrubber runs until the detector senses less than 1 ppm chlorine concentration in the room.  The scrubber for each facility has a capacity to neutralize 2,000 pounds of chlorine with a 99%+ rate of effectiveness.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a power failure, vacuum regulators prevent chlorine from escaping the system.  A backup generator that is activated during a power outage is maintained onsite to power the chlorine systems and water pumps.  If vacuum conditions are c"

Activating the E-Stop button triggers the motorized halogen valves to close the ton-container valve of the active container.\n\n\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n- On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n- Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the accident history at the Carlsbad MWD Upper and Lower Maerkle Stations conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study (April 2019), there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the either the Upper or the Lower Maerkle Stations that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds in the last five years (April 2014 to April 2019) or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of hazardous material for the Five-Year Accident History at the facility.
