All KRG facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner.  It shall be the responsibility of the General Manager to ensure that all procedures are followed.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, it is KRG's policy to immediately call the local fire department and assist this agency.\n\nIt is also KRG's belief and policy to work openly with all local, state, and federal agencies for the betterment of the community and the industry.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nKern Ridge Growers, LLC, Arvin is a carrot grower, packer, processor, and shipper located at 25429 Barbara Street that uses anhydrous ammonia in a closed loop refrigerating system and gaseous chlorine.  The refrigerant charge is 4900 pounds. The chlorine is stored on site with two one ton tanks charging the Fresh Production with chlorine gas.  The gas is mixed with water and acts as a sanitizer.\n\nRelease Scenarios:\nFor this document, two (2) separate ammonia release scenios were used: the \"Worst Case\" as required by law and the \"Alternative release\" (most likely).  The Worst Case release scenario was based on the high pressure receiver completely filled, discharging 110 pounds per minute for a period of 10 minutes.  Distance to the end point of 200 ppm is .87 miles.  \n\nThe Alternative Release scenario was identified through the What-If Study performed on June 4, 1999 at Cal ARP / RMP class held at the Kern County Fire Department instructed by Howard Wines, III.  In an unlikely event of a release the gas / vapor would be discharged to the atsmosphere.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program:\nThe following programs and procedures either have been in place or are being implemented at the time this summary was being written.\n\n     Cali"
