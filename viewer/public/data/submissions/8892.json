The RMP rule applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under '68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release.  Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA PSM standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\n\nThe South Bend Water Works Olive Street Well Field utilizes more than the threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process.  Therefore, this facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in '68.150 by June 21, 1999 (three years after publication of the final rule). Since public employees are covered under the state-delegated OSHA program, the Olive Street Well Field is subject to the OSHA PSM standard and is therefore subject to Program 3 requirements.  \n\nUSEPA's RMP rule requires that covered facilities prepare an executive summary.  The following pages represent the executive summary, summarizing the items required as described in '68.155 (a) through (g).\n\n\n    '68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of the South Bend Water Works chlorination systems, the South Bend Water Works depends on the commitment and team effort of their employees and suppliers.

The Prevention Plan contains safety information relating to chlorine and the chlorination system and establishes standard protocols for items such as system operations, maintenance, system changes, contractor safety, and incident investigation.  The Prevention Plan also describes training for employees on the safe operation of the chlorination systems.  In addition, at least once a year, South Bend Water Works chlorine provider sponsors a training seminar on safety and handling of chlorine, which is attended by both South Bend Water Works and South Bend Fire Department employees.  \n\nThe South Bend Water Works has established emergency response procedures, which are documented in the South Bend Water Works Distribution Department Emergency Response Plan.  The South Bend Water Works Olive Street Well Field facility is equipped with an ambient chlorine detector and audible alarm inside the chlorine ton container room.  Ambient level displays are located outside the chlorine ton container room but are visible through a glass window.\n\nThe ton cylinders are equipped with vacuum regulators, through which chlorine gas flows to the injector under vacuum.  Loss of vacuum causes the vacuum-regulating valve to automatically shut off the gas supply at the source.  All potential releases from South Bend Water Works facilities will be responded to by the South Bend Fire Department, whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine at the facilities and trained to respond to such emergencies.\n\n\n    '68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Olive Street Well Field facility.  This location is an 18-mgd facility consisting of six wells with the potential to produce 3 mgd each.  These wells pump groundwater, which is then treated wit"

One or two additional 1-ton containers, which may be empty or full, may also be stored outside the building on an adjacent storage pad.  \n\nGaseous chlorine from the 1-ton container in use is drawn by a vacuum to a chlorinator located inside the building. In the chlorinator, the gaseous chlorine is mixed with treated water (pumped to provide a higher pressure for injection) to form a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is then injected at an outside pit into the high service main. The chlorinated water is then distributed to South Bend Water Works customers.\n\n    '68.155(c) Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the rule, a worst case and alternative case release scenario were evaluated.  The worst-case release scenario was determined in accordance with the requirements in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c).  For the Olive Street Well Field the worst-case scenario is a release from one of the 1-ton containers (greatest amount held in a single vessel) of chlorine.  It is assumed that the container ruptures and its contents escape to the ground in ten minutes.  The worst-case scenario requires a ground level release height.  It was assumed that the release occurred outside, and no mitigation measures were incorporated into the evaluation.   The reference tables in the USEPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants were used to determine the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario.  The toxic endpoint distance indicated that residential areas, parks, and schools could be impacted by a worst case release.\n\nThe facility is also required to complete at least one alternative release scenario.

As with the worst case scenario, the reference tables in USEPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the toxic endpoint, and the resulting toxic endpoint predicted potential off-site impacts.\n\n\n    '68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Plan describes measures taken at the South Bend Water Works facilities to prevent releases.  The South Bend Water Works has a Prevention Program for the chlorine systems, which is documented in the Prevention Plan.  These prevention measures include elements such as employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, and compliance audits.  \n\nThe Prevention Plan indicates that all South Bend Water Works personnel involved with the chlorination systems are trained in the safe handling of chlorine and in the safe operation and maintenance of the chlorine systems.  The Prevention Plan also indicates that the South Bend Water Works performs regular maintenance activities on the chlorination system as established in a documented maintenance schedule.

These recommendations primarily involved ensuring that procedures established in the Prevention Plan are followed.
