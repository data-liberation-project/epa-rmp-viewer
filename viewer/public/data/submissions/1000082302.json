The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, incident investigation, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility changes and RMP requirements.  Emergency Response Program: The facility's Emergency Response Program has been perfected to produce the maximum effective response in the least amount of time.  The facility has coordinated response with the Emergency Operation Center to ensure that they will respond to any accidental release from the Boron Trifluoride tube trailer.  Safety Management and Changes: The facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  This manager is committed to maintaining the safety of the RMP covered Boron Trifluoride systems through active adherence to procedures and codes.  To ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and investigations will be conducted as required by RMP.  Summary: As documented in this submittal, the RMP for this facility has been completed in accordance with all 40 CFR 68 requirements and the facility has certified compliance.  Gulbrandsen takes pride in and is committee to conducting business in strict conformity with all applicable laws in a safe and responsible manner.  The very highest priority is placed on the health and safety of Gulbrandsen's associates and the community in which we conduct business."

Facility Overview: Gulbrandsen owns and operates a chemical manufacturing plant located in La Porte, Texas.  The facility is regulated under RMP due to on-site Boron Triflouride storage in excess of the RMP applicability threshold of 5,000 pounds.  Boron Trifluoride is used as a catalyst for chemical manufacturing.  Boron Trifluoride is stored in 7-tube trailers with a capacity of 3525 pounds each and in spheres with a capacity of 950 pounds each. Chemical Safety Overview: The facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing management, training, procedure and maintenance systems already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for Boron Trifluoride in response to the RMP requirements.  The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the facility's RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes, and standards. Five Year Accident History: Due to our excellent accident release prevention programs, Gulbrandsen has had no reportable accidents/releases of any chemicals within the five years preceding this RMP submittal.  Prevention Program: The facility has implemented a Program Level 3 Prevention Program for Boron Trifluoride as required by the RMP rule, in accordance with the US EPA guidance.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequence of any accidental Boron Trifluoride release from the facility and include such measures as process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor approval program, prestart-up safety, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of"
