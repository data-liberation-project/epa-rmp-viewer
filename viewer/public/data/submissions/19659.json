This successful operating record is due to PUD's commitment to training programs, operating procedures, and maintenance activities.  \n\n68.155(b) Stationary Source and the Substance Handled\nBillings Public Utilities Department operates a 50-MGD municipal water treatment plant near the Yellowstone River in the south central portion of the city.  Chlorine is used at the treatment facility as the sole disinfectant for the drinking water. Chlorine usage is continual with the largest chlorine usage during the summer months.\n\nChlorine for the chlorination process is stored in ton cylinders.  Normally eight ton cylinders are connected during the summer months and four ton cylinders are connected during the winter months.  Our present chlorine supplier is local.  As such, it is unnecessary to store unconnected chlorine cylinders on-site. The chlorination facilities are contained within the confines of the secure water treatment plant site. This prevents unauthorized personnel from accessing the area. PUD maintains chlorine leak detection devices through out the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms.  There are audible and visual alarms in the building in addition to the alarms being telemetried to the main control room.\n\n68.155(c) Offsite Consequence Analysis\nOne worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario was assessed for the chlorine process.  To ensure a common basis for comparisons EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or more likely.  Active mitigation measures can be used in determining the alternative release scenario while the worst-case scenario only allows consideration of passive mitigation meas"

EPA also requires these facilities to register and submit a Risk Management Plan using RMP*Submit  by June 21, 1999.  Billings Public Utilities Department (PUD) maintains quantities of chlorine above the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds and as such is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  A hazard review was completed to determine the RMP program level applicable to PUD's chlorine system. \n\nThe elements of the RMP are listed below:\n\nX Hazard Assessment - Assess the potential impacts of worst-case and alternative release scenarios and compiles a 5-year accident history.\n\nX Prevention Program - Implement a comprehensive management programs that affects a wide variety of operation, training, and maintenance activities.\n\nX Emergency Response - Implement an emergency action program for the covered processes.\n\nX Risk Management Plan - Register and submit an RMP plan that includes an executive summary, RMP data elements, results of the hazard assessment, and summarizes how all other requirements are met.  Plan to be submitted to EPA by June 21, 1999.\n\nThe information presented in this section is intended to describe the elements of PUD's Risk Management Program.  The format of the section corresponds to the executive summary data elements as dictated in 40 CFR Part 68 Executive Summary Section.  \n\nExecutive Summary Data Elements\n\n\nAccording to EPA guidance the executive summary must include a brief descripton of the facilty's Risk Management Program.  The following sections list each of the required executive summary data elements by rule citation. \n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\nBillings Public Utilities De"

      "SummaryText": "ures.\n \nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine has been defined by EPA to be 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).  This airborne concentration that is used as the toxic endpoint is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects. \n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process.  Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information.  The population number is reported as part of the EPA submittal.  This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a single chlorine, because the chlorine plume would seek lowest elevations in the direction of the prominent winds.  Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method.\n\nRelease scenarios and distances to toxic endpoints are discussed in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nWorst-Case Release Scenario is determined in accordance with the requirements provided in 40 CFR 88.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c). \n\nAs described in USEPA 40 CFR Part 68.25(b) the worst-case release shall be the greater of the following:\n\n1. The greatest amount held in a single vessel or\n2. The greatest amount in a pipe.  \n\nFor the chlorine process at PUD the worst-case release is that a 1-ton cylinder (maximum amount held in a single vessel) of chlorine ruptures and its contents escape to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  In the event the 1-ton cylinder would release its entire contents to the atmosphere in 10 minutes the release rate would be 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the toxic end point worst-case release distance was taken from Exhibit 4-4 of EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  \n\nThe residential population within the 1.3-mile radius of influence was determined to"

No accidents, as described under 40 CFR 68.42(a), have occurred at this facility since it began operation.\n\n68.155(f) Emergency Response Program\nThe emergency response program established by PUD does not require personnel to act as the site incident commander.  In the case of an incident the City of Billings Fire Department becomes the incident commander and assumes the role of directing response activities including any community emergency evacuation measures.  Fire department staff train at the PUD facility on a frequent basis.  The facility's Emergency Response Planning and Response procedures are presented in the section entitled Emergency Planning and Response. \n68.155(g) Safety Improvements\nThe facility is currently in the process of evaluating the recommendations from the PHA revalidation completed in May of 1999.  Any improvements made in response to the recommendations will be documented and added to the PSM/RMP documentation.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs part of PUD's commitment to safety and respect for the hazards associated with handling and storing chlorine, PUD had an existing chlorine management system in place prior to the EPA RMP mandate.  To comply with RMP, PUD re-evaluated their current system for handling chlorine and updated and modified elements as necessary.  The RMP*Submit satisfies PUD's requirement to register and provide the EPA a summary of their Risk Management Program for the chlorine system."

A map showing the impact zone radius is included in the RMP.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nOne alternative release scenario was evaluated for the chlorine process per USEPA 40 CFR 68.165(a)(2).  The alternative release scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\n\nThe scenario for the alternative release follows:\n\nConsideration was given to alternative release scenarios that were considered more likely however, due to the safety systems in place, none of the alternatives considered resulted in an offsite impact.  Even though the PUD has never experienced a valve failure, we felt that this failure represented the most reasonable scenario for an alternative release.  This failure would result in a 5/16 inch opening for the chlorine to escape.\n\nThe alternative release scenario release rate and distance to the toxic endpoint was taken from Exhibit 4-15 of The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The information is presented below.\n\nHole Diameter - 5/16 inch\nRelease rate - 15 lbs/min\nDistance to toxic end point (urban area) - 0.1 miles\n\nNo residences are located within a 0.1 mile of the chlorine facility.  Therefore, the residential population within the alternative release scenario impact area is zero.\n\n68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Prevention Program required for compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 for Program 3 processes is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA PSM.
