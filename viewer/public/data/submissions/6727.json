This adjustment aids the separation\nof copper bearing material from the other components of the solution.  Sulfur dioxide is used because\nit is the most effective and efficient reagent for this purpose.\n\nCertain safety precautions must be observed when handling and storing sulfur dioxide to prevent\nhuman exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, to reduce\nthe hazard to nearby members of the surrounding communities, and to reduce the threat to the\nenvironment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, state and local rules and regulations. \nSafety depends upon the manner in which we handle and store the sulfur dioxide combined with the\nsafety devices inherent in the design of the storage vessel and surrounding process equipment plus\nthe adequate training of our personnel.\n\nThe primary function of The Doe Run Company's mill facilities is to process the raw ore extracted\nfrom the ground into lead, zinc and copper concentrate.  Sulfur dioxide is only used when the copper\nconcentrate is being made.  Copper concentrate constitutes approximately two and one-half percent\nof the total concentrate production at The Doe Run Company mills.  Sulfur dioxide is delivered to\nthe mills via a tanker truck and stored in one tank located at the mill.  Access to the mill facilities is\nrestricted to authorized company employees and company management personnel.\n\nThe regulated substance stored at this facility is anhydrous sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe maximum amount of sulfur dioxide stored at this facility at any on time is 119,600 pounds.\n\nWorst-case scenario - Complete failure of the single sulfur dioxide tank would result in a release of\n119,600 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  The sulfur dioxide is "

This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and encompasses public receptors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary for RMP - viburnum\n\nAlternative scenario - Disconnection of the delivery truck hose from the facility storage tank.  The \none and one-half inch hose is approximately twelve feet long.  The excess flow valves function to stop\nthe flow.  The content of the hose is released, plus 3315 pounds over a period of 10 minutes.  This\nis the amount of time required to make the appropriate response with the proper personnel protective\nequipment.  The liquid is released and is immediately vaporized.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint of 7.8 micrograms per liter for the alternative release scenario is\n2.5 miles.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and impacts some public receptors.\n\nThis facility complies with all applicable Federal, state and local rules and regulations.  The facility\nemployees have been trained according to all Mine Safety Health Administration guidelines. \nEmployee training, maintenance activities, and hazard reviews for this facility are conducted on an\non-going basis.\n\nThere have been no accidents involving sulfur dioxide at this Doe Run facility with specific onsite or\noffsite consequences that have been reported within the last five years.\n\nThe Doe Run Company, SEMO, has in place an emergency response program called the Crises\nCommunication Plan.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local\nfire authority and law enforcement officials, company officials, local political authorities, and the local\nmedia.  Employees have been instructed in the specific measures to be implemented at this facility in\nresponse to an incident involving sulfur dioxide.  Emergency response includes the evacuation of the\nwork place, i"
