      "SummaryText": "16145 LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\n1.0    DeRidder Paper Mill Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\n\n    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility processes.  The Boise Cascade Corporation (Boise Cascade) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nBoise Cascade owns and operates the DeRidder Paper Mill (the Mill) located in Beauregard Parish, Louisiana.  The Mill produces linerboard and newsprint products.  The Mill purchases pine wood grown in the region, chips the timber, utilizes mechanical and chemical methods to produce pulp from wood fibers and processes the pulp into linerboard and newsprint products.  Methods used in the pulping process include cutting, debarking, chipping, grinding, thermomechanical processes and cooking.  \n\nSome newsprint pulp is bleached.  Historically, Boise Cascade has bleached with chlorine as the bleaching agent.  The Mill has implemented changes in bleaching operations to prepare to meet the upcoming Cluster Rule requirements.  Specifically chlorine dioxide has replaced chlorine as the pulp bleaching chemical.  \n\nThese changes were evaluated to determine if any new regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeding the threshold quantity would be brought into the Mill.  Based on process knowledge of the changes, Boise Cascade did not identify any listed flammable substances due to the process changes.  However, the process changes result in chlorine dioxide being manufactured and stored at the Mill above the threshold quantity.  These process "

The chlorine reduction requires that a new offsite consequence analysis be conducted to develop a new worst case scenario for the mill and to review if the alternate (\"planning\") cases need to be revised.  \n\n\nChlorine and chlorine dioxide, their largest quantity on site, and their associated threshold quantities are presented in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1\nLargest Quantity of Regulated Substance\n\nRegulated Substance     Largest Quantity On Site(lbs)    Threshold Quantity(lbs)\nChlorine Dioxide    6,033    1,000\nChlorine    2,000    2,500\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nBoth chlorine and chlorine dioxide are stored above threshold quantity at the Mill.  Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint of chlorine yields the greatest radius of impact that reaches public receptors.  In addition, the Mill is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM).  Therefore, the DeRidder Paper Mill is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill does not have any flammable substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case release scenarios for flammable substances is not required.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nChlorine WCR Scenario \n\nThe endpoint for a worst-case release of chlorine is based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2) developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  The ERPG-2 for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario was identified to be one 1-ton chlorine cylinder used to treat the mill water supply.  The chlorine cylinder is transported on site and the chlorine is piped directly to the water treatment system. The ARP Program requirement for a toxic worst-case scenario is to assume that the total quantity is released in ten minutes.\n\nChlorine Dioxide WCR Scenario\n    \nThe worst-case release scenario for chlorine dioxide was"

The worst-case DTE radii for chlorine and chlorine dioxide are estimated to be 3.0 miles and 11 miles, respectively.  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for chlorine dioxide and its resulting DTE were chosen as the worst-case release scenario for the Mill.  \n\n\nTABLE 2\nDistance to Endpoint for Worst-Case Scenario\n\nChemical Name    Weight(lbs)    Toxic EndpointERPG-2(mg/L)    Distance toEndpoint(miles)\nChlorine    2,000    0.0087    3\n    Chlorine Dioxide        6,033        0.0028        11\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\n\nThe following conditions are considered for alternative release scenarios:\n\n?    Release rate dependent upon scenario;\n?    Use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source;\n?    Actual release height; and\n?    Consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill does not have any flammable substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of regulated flammable substances is not required.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nOne alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  The regulated toxic substances at the Mill are chlorine and chlorine dioxide.  Hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenarios of chlorine and chlorine dioxid"

There are ten one-ton chlorine cylinders attached by a common header which feeds the chlorine to the water treatment facilities.  An approximately 3/8-inch diameter leak develops in the header.  The release duration occurs over a 60-minute period.   The release occurs without any active or passive mitigation.\n    \nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative-case release of chlorine using an accidental release model is presented in Table 3.  The alternative-case release of chlorine resulted in an 0.18-mile distance to the 0.0087 mg/L ERPG-2 endpoint.  \n\nChorine dioxide\n\nChorine dioxide is generated on site and stored in two 78,000-gallon storage tanks at an approximately 93% capacity.  For chlorine dioxide, the ARS is defined as a rupture of a 4-inch diameter transfer line leading from a 1% ClO2 solution storage tank to the bleach plant.  The transfer pump operates at 200 gallons per minute (gpm).  The spill is assumed to proceed at the pump rate.  Because of the high vapor pressure of ClO2 and the turbulent action of the spill, all of the CLO2 is assumed to volatilize as soon as the solution impacts the ground.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative-case release of chlorine dioxide using RMPComp* is presented in Table 3.  The alternative-case release of chlorine dioxide resulted in a 0.50-mile distance to the 0.0028 mg/L EHS-LOC equivalent (IDLH) endpoint.\n\nTable 3\nDistance to Endpoint for Alternative Release Scenario\n\nChemical Name    Storage Capacity(lbs.)

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios that are assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\nOperating Procedures\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) emergency shutdown, (4) normal shutdown, (5) initial startup of a new process, and (6) emergency operation and start up after emergency shutdown.
