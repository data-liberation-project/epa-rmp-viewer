Following is a summary of the programs, policies, and procedures in place to reduce the risk of a hazardous materials release.\r\nThe purpose of this RMP is threefold: 1.) to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards, 2.) to identify hazards associated with the use of Anhydrous Ammonia, and 3.) to provide procedures to minimize the risks involved with handling this material. \r\nGreenGate Fresh has implemented the Risk Management Plan (RMP) at the Salinas, California facility in order to comply with the regulations, and to fulfill this facility's responsibility to protecting its employees, equipment, property, the surrounding community, and the environment from accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n1.\tRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\nGreenGate Fresh LLLP operates a fresh salad processing and shipping facility in Salinas, California. Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility, as documented here. GreenGate Fresh hires outside contractors to maintain the ammonia refrigeration equipment to prevent accidents. The Emergency Response Plan in Appendix K lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\r\nThere are both portable and fixed refrigeration systems onsite and all have safeties to detect unsafe operating conditions. Fixed and portable equipment support the cold storage rooms, processing facility, and vacuum pre-cooling equipment. The portable equipment located outdoors has no detection system; however, there is an ammonia sensor located at the diffusion tank that is tied into the detection alarm system.  Fixed equipment is loca"

Operators monitor the system when it is operational. \r\nGreenGate Fresh utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations.  These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases.  Onsite personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\r\nOnsite personnel will provide limited initial emergency response. Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide any necessary first response within the limits of operators' training and capabilities. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down, to prevent or reduce an off-site release. \r\nNo emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other onsite personnel. \r\nLocal fire and police departments with mutual aide response will provide emergency response for a major release event.  The refrigeration contractor is also on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency contact information is included in Section V of this document.\r\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years. Master templates for documenting training are in Appendix G. These may be reproduced as needed. \r\n2.\tDescription of Stationary Source and Substance Handled\r\nThe GreenGate Fresh facility is located at 1222 Merrill Street in Salinas, California. The new facility was constructed under applicable codes and industry standards.\r\nThis facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their process operations.

      "SummaryText": "ammonia distributed throughout the facility. The ammonia refrigeration systems are used for vacuum cooling, produce cooling and cold storage prior to shipment. \r\nThe ammonia refrigeration-system equipment at the facility consists of both fixed and portable equipment. The refrigeration system configuration includes two compressor skids, three water chiller skids, a high-pressure receiver/condenser skid, fan coils, and safety equipment. The refrigeration system is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry is as follows:\r\n1.\tLow pressure vapor is compressed to high pressure gas by refrigeration compressors.\r\n2.\tHigh pressure vapor is condensed to high pressure liquid by the evaporative condenser.  Condensation occurs because of heat rejection to ambient resulting from the evaporation of water sprayed on the condenser coil.\r\n3.\tHigh pressure liquid gravity feeds from the condenser to the high pressure receiver where it is stored until needed.\r\n4.\tHigh pressure ammonia is fed from the high pressure receiver to the low pressure vessels.  This is made possible by the pressure differential between the two types of vessels.  Pressure is dropped when the liquid passes through an expansion device located between the high and low pressure vessels.\r\n5.\tThe evaporators are recirculation types where low pressure liquid is pumped from low pressure receiver. The evaporators are room coils for maintaining cold room or freezer storage temperatures.\r\n6.\tEvaporation of the low pressure liquid occurs due to warmer air coming in contact with the evaporators. The evaporation produces the cooling effect.  \r\nA mixture of liquid and vapor is returned to the low pressure vessel. Low pressure vapor is drawn off by the compressors and the liquid is circulated back through the room coils. \r\nThe refrigeration systems consist of the following equipment:\r\n\u00bf\tCompressors,\r\n\u00bf\tLow pressure receivers,\r\n\u00bf\tA high pressure receiver,\r\n\u00bf\tEvaporative cooling condensers,\r\n\u00bf\tAir"

A complete set of system drawings is in the RMP Binder. \r\nThe substance handled at GreenGate Fresh, anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue.  The gas is pungent and may cause suffocation, as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled.  Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions.  Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, and serious skin burn.  A Material Safety Data sheet (MSDS) for ammonia is included in the RMP binder.  Written in both Spanish and English, the MSDS details the chemical properties and health hazards of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nGreenGate Fresh maintains an accidental release prevention program designed to eliminate or minimize ammonia releases.  The program includes equipment monitoring, regular inspections and maintenance, and log keeping of operating conditions, scheduled maintenance, emergency response, and operator training.\r\nThe program also consists of pre-startup inspection, emergency response, and regular training. A Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), was performed in January 2013. Prior to start up, an engineering walk-through was performed that included a thorough review of the refrigeration equipment and safety systems. In addition to visual inspections, pre-startup and code compliance reviews were performed. These reports are included in Appendix P and J, in the RMP binder located at the facility."

Green Gate contracts with Hasler and/or Kemper Refrigeration for operations and maintenance. They are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency evacuation and response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. \r\nAn alarm and detection system monitors the facility for unsafe ammonia concentration levels and for operating conditions outside of safety set points.  Relief valves are installed to protect both the high and low sides from an overpressure situation.  Relief valves are piped to a diffusion tank, which provides a system-wide mitigation measure.  Compressors have control panels, which will automatically shut down the compressors if pressure and temperature set points are exceeded.  An emergency control box allows system pressures to be relieved without releasing to the ambient.
