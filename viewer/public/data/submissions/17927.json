Operational and test procedures are in place which ensure that the scrubber system is operating correctly. Chlorine is not vented to the atmosphere under any circumstances.  Full twenty pound cylinders are stored in the repackaging area until loaded onto delivery trucks.  Transport and loading of the  cylinders adheres to the Chlorine Institute's Guidelines for Transportation of Chlorine Cylinders, Pamphlet 76.\n\nFilling is done by trained, qualified personnel during daylight hours. Written filling procedures exist and are\ncomplied with. The entire system is evacuated and the one-ton container liquid valve is shut during non-working hours.  \n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario must consider the largest quantity of a regulated substance handled on\nsite in a single vessel at any time, taking into account administrative controls on the vessel's contents and\nusage as per 40 CFR Part 68 Section 68.25.  A one- ton container of chlorine is the largest vessel in the repackaging system. The one- ton container is, at most, filled with 2,000 lbs of liquid chlorine. The Worst Case release scenario for the one- ton container of chlorine is the release of the 2,000 lbs of chlorine at the rate of 200 lb/min for 10 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm for the Worst Case scenario would extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe  Alternative Release scenario for the one ton container of chlorine is a small leak occurring in the\npacking material around the valve stem of the vapor phase valve located on the one ton container.\nThere are no active or passive mitigation measures that would reduce the amount of chlorin"

Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distance for each report scenario exists to restrict to a minimum, the \namount of chlorine lost from a one- ton container or 20 lb container if accidental release were to occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine process system and the training provided to the operators of the process system.\n\n3d. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict the amount of \nchlorine released to a minimum if released were to occur. The mitigation measures are based upon the \ndesign, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine process systems; their related equipment and\ncomponents; and the treatment system.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations. There are safety \nmeetings and safety training. The Process Safety Management (PSM.) program implemented at the facility\nfor the chlorine process system and the related activities and equipment represents the facility's main \nactive commitments to an accidental prevention program.\n\n5.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emegency Response Policies.\n\nCCC Pool Services stores and repackages chlorine which is a hazardous material and a regulated subtance and is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCCC Pool Services provides chlorination services to swimming pools. Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one ton chlorine containers to 20 pound capacity service cylinders. The 20 pound service cylinders are used by CCC Pool Services service staff to add chlorine into customer swimming pools.   The amount of chlorine repackaged per month is seasonally dependent. The summer months, for obvious reasons, are the busiest time of the year. Consequently, the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period.  CCC Pool Services stores a maximum of 8,000 pounds of chlorine. This amount includes the contents of 3 one- ton containers in storage, 96 twenty pound cylinders, and the 1 one ton container in the repackaging process.  Chlorine is purchased from and delivered by a commercial chlorine supplier.  Delivery of one- ton containers is during normal working hour.  Any residual chlorine in small diameter, short length piping is directed to a liquid caustic absorption scrubber. The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company services personnel to customers' swimming pools where the services personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool. The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company"

The one- ton containers are placed in the Fill Yard. The one- ton \ncontainers are manually rolled to the desired storage location and chocked to prevent movement.  Empty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are chained or strapped in place in an upright\nposition.  The company has administrative procedures in place that limits the amount of chlorine at the \nfacility.  The procedure, in part requires, the owner/operator to verify the existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an order and delivery of one- ton containers of chlorine will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 8,000 pounds in the Fill Yard.\n\nThe entire facility is fenced with a locking gate. The Fill Yard is not exposed to passing vehicular traffic. The Fill Yard contains all of the chlorine containers and is locked after normal working hours. Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the Fill Yard. Container storage and handling is per Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.\n\nThe Major repacking system components are the D.O.T. approved one- ton chlorine container,the proprietary tranfer piping assembly, the twenty pound capacity D.O.T. approved cylinders, the pan scales for weighing the cylinders during the filling operation, and the chlorine adsorption system.\n\nBatch filling of cylinders is accomplished by placing up to two cylinders on separated pan scales and \nattaching the cylinders to the appropiate transfer assembly connectors.
