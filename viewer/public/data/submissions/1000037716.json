Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThis facility handles anhydrous ammonia which is considered a hazardous material. The properties of anhydrous ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle anhydrous ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThis facility has refrigerated and freezer storage facilities which are capable of satisfying the requirements of any type of food service, community or agricultural client.  With having the 29 segregated storage rooms and an available temperature range from ambient to -20\u00b0 F, the layout of the storage facilities enables the storage of a wide variety of products.  Having the 3.2 million total cubic feet of storage lends flexibility to the clients to meet client seasonal demands and production overflows.  The available storage uses the latest refrigeration technology.  This includes computerized temperature monitoring, serpentine pre-cooling rooms, climate controlled truck loading docks, humidity controlled storage, and security personnel on-site 24 hours a day and seven (7) days per a week.\r\n\r\nThere is a daily maximum of 32,000 lb of anhydrous ammonia at the facility.\r\n\r\n3a. Administrative Controls\r\n\r\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of anhydrous ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedu"

Mitigation Measures\r\n\r\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of anhydrous ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system and its related equipment and components.\r\n\r\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations. There are safety meetings and safety training. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the anhydrous ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n5. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere were no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the last five-year period.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Live Oak Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated. The Sutter County - Environmental Health can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 3 Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThere are commitments made under the State of California's Risk Management Plan (RMP) that are, or have been, being implemented at this time. Current applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the anhydrous ammonia system."
