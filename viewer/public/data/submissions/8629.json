An emergency condition which can not be controlled by the area people involved and requires the immediate assistance of additional plant people.\n2. An emergency condition that presents real evidence of real danger to the remainder of the plant or to our neighbors.\n\nThe principle considerations in case of emergencies are:\n\n1. To rescue and provide medical care of injured persons.\n2. To prevent the spread of the emergencies.\n3. To protect property already involved from further damage.\n4. To perform basic functions necessary in relation to the item 1, 2 and 3 without endangering the lives of plant people. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibility\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Poteau Public Works Director (or his designate) to implement the inspections specified in this plan and to provide proper information, equipment, and supplies to allow full implementation of the procedures as specified. The Public Works Director shall also ensure that the appropriate people are quickly notified whenever signs of distress are observed. The Public Works Director should be familiar with this and assure himself that people under his direction are familiar with their duties during an emergency situation\n\n\nAuthority\n\nShould critical conditions develop which may lead to an endangerment of a Poteau Public Works people, the public, or the environment, the Public works Director is authorized to commit all resources at his disposal to prevent and minimize loss of life and property.\n\n\nPublic Awareness\n\nWhen a major problem occu"

People and equipment must be readily available to respond at a moments notice.\n\nUpon discovery of a spill or fire situation, the initial examination will provide important information to responding people:\n\n\t1.\tWhat happened,\n\t2.\tWhere it happened,\n\t3.\tWhom it happened to,\n\t4.\tWhen it happened\n\t5.\tThe extent of the damage\n\t6.\tWhat aid is needed.\n\nMust be included in the report to the Plant Emergency Response Technicians. Once response people receive this information, an evaluation will be made as to the proper response procedures to be employed. There are four basic components of any spill/fire response sequence. \n\nRescue, Alert, Contain, and Evacuate\n\nThis sequence is represented by the acronym RACE.\n\nRescue. In the event of an emergency, rescue of injured people is one of the first priorities whether a spill or fire, the points to consider are:\n\n\n1. Properly protect yourself. Put on protective clothing before attempting rescue - you do not want to become a victim yourself. Unless you know the hazards of the specific material and the appropriate equipment to wear, use at least EPA \"Level B'' protective gear (including chemical resistance coveralls and SCBA).\n\n2. Use the buddy system. Do not enter the danger area without at least notifying someone else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. If the victim's life is at risk, remove the victim from the immediate spill/fire area as soon as possible. Otherwise, provide first aid, care and comfort until more qualified people arrive. Extinguish incipient stage fires by using fire extinguisher or hand lines ( 1\" or less). If the person has spilled chemicals on his/her clothing, get him/her to an emergency shower as soon as possible. Rinse for at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing to prevent trapping chemicals against the skin.\n\n4. Contact emergency medical people. If the person has stopped breathing or is having trouble breathing, enlist the help of someone nearby who knows artificial resuscitation and CPR.\n\nAlert. Notification Of the emer"

Evacuation is the removal of non-essential people from specified areas. Depending on the circumstances of the plant emergency, evacuation may include the immediate vicinity, adjacent areas and buildings, and off-site areas. The decision to evacuate is made by the Plant Emergency Response Technicians.

The overall system contains a central control of the alarm.\n\n2. Zones\n\nThe zone is a follows:\n\nAround Chlorine Cylinders ( Alarm Distance most of Plant Grounds)\n           In the building housing the caustic chemicals\t\n\n3.  Alarms\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Alarms Purpose\n\nThe Alarms is used if the building is occupied (8am - 4:30pm) for Evacuation Procedures, etc, ( Chemical Spill or Fire).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL\n\n\n\nEven though the \"significance\" of a spill may designate response actions by various responding personnel, the principals for containing a spill/release are the same, regardless of the size of the spill. Containment includes safely stopping the discharge and preventing it from spreading further if at all practical. Depending on the location and extent of the spill, containment can be accomplished in a number of ways.\n\nPoteau Public Works people will operate in a fashion to contain spills when personnel risks are minimal. Once a release is evaluated, the need for a licensed qualified and certified remediation team will be determined by the initial responders and/or the Technical Coordinators on the response team.\n\nBefore entering the spill area, personnel are reminded to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves. This includes obtaining proper protective equipment, notifying designated officials and obtaining appropriate response equipment and supplies.\n\nOn any spill, attempts will be made to contain the material and place it in a SAFE .and SECURE condition. The Response Team will then determine the appropriate remediation course of action.\n\nListed below are general guidelines to be followed. Any spill response must be in accordance with the instructions provided on specific MSDS's.\n\nA. Stop Discharge. Stopping the leak at its source may consist of\n\n1. Turning off pumps or closing valves. \n2. Returning containers"

Containment:  The expansion of an existing spill can be prevented or slowed:\n\n1. ON WATER - If the spill floats, use floating barriers or booms, porous absorbent materials, or by \"herding\" using propellers, water hose streams or chemicals that change the surface tension of the spilled waste.\n\n2. ON LAND - If a spill occurs on the ground or concrete containment surface, use porous or absorbent barriers. (See Table 1).\n\n3. GASES OR VAPORS: In the case of gases or vapors, it is preferable to disperse a gas vapor cloud by using fans or blowers.  Vapor emissions from flammable or toxic liquids may be controlled by covering the area with high expansion foam or by using knock-down misting where the mist absorbs the vapor or gas.  In the case of large clouds or highly toxic materials, evacuation and natural dissipation may be the only answer.\n\nC. Collection: Upon containment, the spilled material and the used absorbent are collected and containerized for disposal.\n \n1. ON WATER - Floating wastes are skimmed off with their absorbent, run through separators and placed in storage.  The sorbent with its absorbed spill materials is usually collected by skimming, direct pickup, filtering, or settling.  This can be a cumbersome and hazardous process.  Materials which dissolve in water cannot typically be recovered.  Materials which sink may be pumped or dredged from the bottom (although difficult and expensive to do), then separated and stored.\n2. ON LAND - Spilled material may be diked by absorbent or pumped or drained to a dike temporary storage area: or absorbent may be used to soak up the entire spill.  Recovery is accomplished by pumping to storage or by separation from the absorbent used.  Contaminated soil only need to be removed and replaced in some cases. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRESPONSE\n\nWhen an employee detects a leak, spil"

Absorbent material will be placed over the spilled polymer and the recovery plan enacted that may include the immediate recovery of the spilled materials.

He will direct efforts by trained designated employees (calling them to the site as necessary) to control the fire until relieved by the Emergency Coordinator.\n\nEmployees fighting the fire should wear gloves, boots, hard hats, and respirators, and use a chemical fire extinguisher where oil may be burning.
