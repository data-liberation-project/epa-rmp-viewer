The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 2620 NW Huxman Road in Silver Lake, Kansas (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There are four anhydrous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility, one tank with a maximum capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons, two tanks with a maximum capacity of approximately 12,000 gallons each, and one tank with a maximum capacity of approximately 8,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into 1,000 and 2,000 gallon nurse tanks.  A maximum total of 60 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia are stored at the facility at any given time.  The contents of the nurse tanks are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n  \n"

      "SummaryText": "\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Plan program.  The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures, in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications, to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves.  Emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Shawnee County Fire District #1 (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.    Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes t"

      "SummaryText": "o Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits, hazard reviews, and an RMP site inspection conducted by an outside contractor.  The Location Manger is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1.    Develop equipment specific replacement schedules and maintain documentation.\n\n2.    Document emergency response and operating procedure training to be conducted prior to each filling season (twice per year).\n\n3.    Document routinely scheduled maintenance inspections and maintain files.\n\n4.    Document that maintenance repairs/replacements are compliant with ANSI, ASME, and OSHA standards for ammonia systems.\n\n5.    Install excess flow valves and break away valves on the ammonia fill hoses used at the nurse tank filling stations.\n\n6.    Investigate potential for automatic/interlocked liquid shut off valves with liquid level indicators.\n\n7.    Evaluate potential installation of a security system to protect the ammonia process.\n\n8.    Install a wind sock in a prominent location for emergency response and evacuation.\n\n9.    Repair the areas of the storage tanks and the appurtenances that are rusted.\n\n10.    Install additional bollards around storage tanks and nurse filling stations to protect the fill valves and associated piping.\n\n11.    Confirm that the saddles of each storage tank extend over at least one third of the circumference of the shell as per ANSI Standard K61.6.4.1.\n\n12.    Strap storage tanks to the saddles.\n\n13.    Install emergency shut off valves for the storage tanks which will be activated with a remote controller.  These valves will be activated in the event of possible ammonia release due to piping or appurtenance failure."
