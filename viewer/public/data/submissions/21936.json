We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n? A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n? A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n? An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n? A five-year accidental history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n? An overview of our emergency response program\n? An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n? The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n?

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe facility worst-case release scenario for toxic chemicals is for Acrylonitrile.  The quantity is 14,116,284 pounds and is the entire amount that could be lost due to a catastrophic failure of the largest storage tank.  The worst-case weather conditions are assumed, and the maximum estimated exposure distance is then computed by the EPA method.  Then a list of the potentially impacted receptors is generated and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) is provided the information.  Additionally the LEPC is provided information for administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for this scenario.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe facility alternate case release scenario for toxic chemicals is for Acrylonitrile.  The toxic quantity is 1,000 pounds and is the entire amount that could be lost due to a catastrophic failure of a loading hose.  The worst-case weather conditions are assumed, and the maximum estimated exposure distance is then computed by the EPA method.  Then a list of the potentially impacted receptors is generated and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) is provided the information.
