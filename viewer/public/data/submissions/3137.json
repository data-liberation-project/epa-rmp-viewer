Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, is stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia may be stored.\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that may be stored on-site is approximately 149,280 pounds.  Therefore, the total capacity of the facility is approximately 149,280 pounds.  The largest storage vessel at our facility could contain approximately 149,280 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario.\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the storage vessel of anhydrous ammonia, which would be a quantity of approximately 75 tons when filled to the greatest amount allowed, 85%, released over 10 minutes resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 149,280 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 4.4 miles.

The alternative release scenario modelded for the purposes of this plan is a 1 minute release from a transfer hose failure.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 95 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion 200 PPM) is .10 miles.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.11), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shuttoffs, and emergency shutoff valves.  Our ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at minimum annually.  The training consists of classroom lectures, current videos, and hands-on demonstrations.\n\nFive year accident history.\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, including evacuations on or off-site.\n\nThe emergency response program.\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  The local fire department and the local LEPC are both aware of our handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\nWe do not plan to make any cha"
