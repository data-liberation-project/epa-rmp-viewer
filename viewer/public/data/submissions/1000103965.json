The emergency plan is reviewed annually and revised as needed. Changes triggered by the Management of Change process are administered per that specific program and include training of affected personnel. \n\nThe Bishop complex emergency response program is coordinated with the Corpus Christi / Nueces County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), City of Bishop Volunteer Fire Department, Kingsville Fire Department, Kleberg County Sheriff's Department, and local ambulance services. The OQ Chemicals Bishop Facility has 24-hour communications capability with the emergency response organizations.

Final reports of audits are retained per the company records retention policy. \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nOQ Chemicals Bishop process has hazards that are managed to help ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the specific regulated substances (i.e., flammables).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied throughout the facility.  In the area of the plant subject to the RMP regulation, this program helps prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Features\nThis plant has safety equipment / features throughout the production unit to detect a release, control a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. \n\nRelease detection is accomplished by the use of alarms on unit control panels to indicate releases on key equipment, and high and low level alarms on storage equipment.  Releases are controlled by the use of pressure relief devices that discharge to atmosphere and boiler system; manual and automatic isolation valves; automated shut down systems for key equipment; and redundant equipment.  The impact of releases are reduced or mitigated by the use of fire extinguishing systems, personal protective equipment for affected personnel, secondary containment, process fluid isolation sumps, and access to on-site emergency response team.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNone\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nOQ Chemicals Bishop maintains a joint emergency resp"

The facility has controlled access for employees, visitors, and contractors.  Work on specific equipment is governed by a job permitting system to ensure that all hazards are identified and addressed prior to commencing work.  These safe work processes, supporting procedures, and training on the processes ensure that maintenance activities are safely performed. Safe Work Permit process includes confined space entry, hot work, line breaking and energy isolation plans (EIP).  \n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC)\nOQ Chemicals Bishop has a comprehensive and mature management of change system. It requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, operating technology, procedures, and other changes be reviewed and authorized before implementation. Changes are reviewed to ensure controls are in place to manage new hazards and verify that no existing controls have been compromised.  Changes are documented on corresponding chemical hazard lists, process operating parameters, equipment files, and procedures.  Affected personnel are trained on the changes to be implemented. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nOQ Chemicals Bishop documents and investigates all incidents that resulted in (or could have reasonably resulted in) a fire, explosion, release, major damage to property or equipment, environmental release / damage, or personal injury. The investigation strives to record the facts of the incident and identify how to prevent recurrence.   Incident information, including required corrective actions, is maintained in an electronic database available to all OQ Chemicals employees.

Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated during the selection process and are reviewed periodically by facility HSE and management.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR)\nOQ Chemicals uses a PSSR process to review modifications that cause a significant change in the process safety information. The PSSR will help ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. The PSSR provides an additional opportunity to check that construction was executed as specified in the design and all supporting systems are ready. The PSSR involves construction field verification.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY (MI)\nOQ Chemicals Bishop uses established practices and procedures to maintain process and support equipment in a safe operating condition. The MI program includes training, inspections, correction of deficiencies, and quality assurance of work products.  Maintenance personnel are trained on the process, safety and health hazards, maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and safe work processes to help ensure that they execute their jobs safely.  Documented equipment files and maintenance histories are maintained. \n\nInspections and preventive maintenance are performed on a scheduled basis to ensure equipment and safety devices function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.

SOPs are available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform assigned tasks. SOPs provide a basis for training operators.  Procedures are revised as needed to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTRAINING\nOQ Chemicals Bishop trains employees that will operate the process equipment.  The program involves guided study, independent study, and on-the-job training.  Operators must demonstrate that they have the skills to operate process equipment safely and correctly before they are allowed to work independently.  Operators receive refresher training on a specified schedule.  Training is documented.

The EPA RMP regulation covers many elements: hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs.  The RMP regulation applies to facilities that use more than specified amounts of certain designated chemicals.  The RMP regulation applies to the OQ Chemicals Bishop Facility based on its use of acetaldehyde. Processing unit using formaldehyde was shutdown in 2017.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED CHEMICALS\nThe OQ Chemicals Bishop Facility is located between the communities of Kingsville (Kleberg County) and Bishop (Nueces County), Texas.  It is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of Nueces County.  Four employee shifts operate the facility round-the-clock.  The OQ Chemicals  Bishop Facility has approximately 30 employees and a small force of contract employees.\n\nIn 2014, Oman Oil purchased OXEA Bishop from Advent International.
