This\n\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\n\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\n\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\n\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\n\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Springtown gas plant, located in Springtown, Texas, operates a variety of processes to\n\nrecover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, condensate) from field gas.  The\n\ngas plant also uses Propane for refrigeration.  There are no threshold\n\nquantities of toxic substances present.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because\n\nprocesses at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's)\n\nrisk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and\n\nHealth Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary\n\naddresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to\n\nimplement the accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Springtown gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety\n\nmanagement and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating\n\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\n\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\n\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees "

These documents address chemical properties and associated\n\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\n\ndesign basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned\n\nresponsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The reference documents\n\nand their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help\n\nemployees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\n\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is\n\nsupplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known\n\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas\n\nplant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,\n\nlevel, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\n\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\n\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the\n\ndesign and construction of process equipment.

These\n\nprocedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent\n\ntraining of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as\n\ncurrent and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary\n\nto reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are\n\nreadily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to\n\nsafely perform their job task.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Springtown gas plant has\n\nimplemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a\n\nprocess.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already\n\nfamiliar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is\n\npaired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators\n\ndemonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the\n\nduties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all\n\noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their\n\nskills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted\n\nat least every three years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means\n\nused to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Springtown gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of\n\nincreased maintenance or construction activities.

This\n\nhelps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and\n\nspare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Springtown gas plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker\n\nand process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support\n\npersonnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment\n\nundergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before\n\nprocess piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit a"

These procedures (and others), along with training of\n\naffected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are\n\nperformed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Springtown gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered\n\nprocesses.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals,\n\ntechnology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be\n\nproperly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure\n\nthat adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing\n\ncontrols have not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process\n\noperating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate\n\nthese changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary\n\ntraining on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Springtown gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could\n\nhave resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. \n\nThe goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent\n\na recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings,\n\ndevelops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant\n\nmanagement for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's\n\nfindings and recommendations are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding\n\nor recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees\n\n(including contractors) who could be affecte"

Incident investigation reports are\n\nretained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA\n\nrevalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Springtown gas\n\nplant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required\n\nby the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at\n\nleast every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel may participate as audit team members. \n\nThe audit team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions\n\ntaken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution\n\nof each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Springtown gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure\n\ncontinued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to\n\nprevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized above is applied to all RMP covered processes at\n\nthe Springtown gas plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent\n\npotential accidents that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Springtown gas plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly\n\ndetect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of\n\nsafety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\nAA? Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\nAA? Process relief valves that discharge to a vent stack\n\nAA? Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\nAA? Automated shutdown systems"

Personal protective equipment\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Springtown gas plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. \n\nThere have been no releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, property or\n\nenvironmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  Also, there has been a decreasing\n\ntrend in the frequency of incidental releases.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Springtown gas plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect\n\nthe safety of workers and the public, as well as the environment.  There are no 112(r) threshold\n\ntoxic substances on the plant site.  For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance,\n\nincluding the possibility of a fire, response actions have been coordinated with the local fire\n\ndepartment, and mechanisms for notification are in place.  Employees receive training as\n\nnecessary to perform their specific emergency actions.  The emergency action plan is updated\n\nwhen necessary, and affected personnel are informed and/or trained in the changes.  \n\n\n\nThe gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and\n\nemergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the\n\npublic of an incident if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Springtown gas plant has resolved all findings from PHAs."
