      "SummaryText": " - Mennel Milling Company operates a flour mill in Roanoke, Virginia that processes wheat into many different grades of flour.  Several of the grades involve a process in which chlorine is addes to the milled flour to achieve a desired PH level.  In addition, a small amount of chlorine is added to the wheat prior to storage and milling to prevent microbiological activity.\n\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling Company and used in one ton containers.  The supplier delivers full chlorine containers to the site via truck.  The containers are unloaded and stored in an indoor storage area before they are moved into the chlorine room where theya re connected to the feed system.  Mennel Milling staff connect the ton containers to the feed system.  The maximum number of ton containers on site is eight, for a maximum quanity of 16,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\nMennel Milling Company uses a vacuum feed system that is inherently safe.  These systems involve the use of air flowing through an eductor that creates a vacuum.  This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system.  If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interruped and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of chlorine gas.\n\nMennel Milling Company has contracted with Research Products Company (REPCO) of Salina, Kansas to perform preventive and corrective maintenance on the chlorine feed systems.\n\nMennel Milling Company has developed a comprehensive, accidental release prevention program as part of the OSHA PSM program.  The elements of this program include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nManagement of Change\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation\nContractor Management\nHot Work Permits\nIncident Investigation\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at Mennel Milling Company that have result"

      "SummaryText": "ed in deaths, injuries, or significant damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nAn emergency Action Plan has been developed for the site.  This plan contains measure that Mennel Milling Company staff can take to alert employees of a release, how to distinguish between an incidental release and a significant release and many other elements.  Mennel Milling Company staff will receive training to allow for defensive action in response to an on-site release.  In the event of a chlorine release, Mennel Milling Company will contact the Roanoke Fire Department for technical support.  The fire department is trained and equipped to respond to chlorine incidents.\n\nThe facility is in the process of coordinating its emergency response activities with the City of Roanoke Fire Department and the Roanoke Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nMennel Milling Company has performed hazard evaluations for the chlorination processes in the facility.  As a result of these evaluations, several changes have been implemented in the recent past to improve safety.\n - Installation of chlorine gas detectors to sense a leak and alert employees.\n - Establishment of a procedure to minimize the potential for accidents during unloading of full chlorine containers.\n - Labeling of all chlorine piping throughout the facility."
