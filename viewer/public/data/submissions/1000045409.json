The AA, Cl2, and TiCl4 are regulated substances under the Accidental Release Program regulations, which governs the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule).  Certain safety precautions must be observed when handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to employees and nearby members of the community.  It is US Vanadium policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which these chemicals are handled, training of personnel who operate the processes, and the safety devices inherent in the design of the storage vessels. \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program presents a logical, coordinated course of action to be followed in case of an emergency.  The program utilizes information from the Emergency Response Guidebook by the Department of Transportation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.0  US VANADIUM AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nUS Vanadium includes a vanadium recovery process and a halides manufacturing process. Anhydrous ammonia is used to aid in the recovery of the vanadium product in a crystallization circuit. Chlorine is introduced into the vanadium halide production process as a reactant. Titanium tetrachloride is blended with vanadium oxytrichloride to form vanadium-titanium mixtures.  The AA, Cl2, and TiCI4 are the only chemicals that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list which are stored on site above threshold quantities. US Vanadium has no flammable substances regulated by the RMP Rule.  Storage conditions for the toxic chemicals r"

US Vanadium's Process Safety Management (PSM) program for AA, Cl2, and TiCl4 follows the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards (29 CFR 1910.119). Although the PSM program has been developed to follow the guidelines of the OSHA PSM standard, it should be noted that the US Vanadium facility is under the jurisdiction of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).  The requirements for the prevention program take a proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of regulated substances that pose a danger to human health and the environment. This prevention program is a vital part of everyday operations at US Vanadium, as safety is the chief priority. The program employs high standards and includes the following steps and programs that lead to successful accident prevention. \n\n\n\n3.1  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nProcess safety includes information pertaining to the hazards of the substances in the covered processes as well as technology and equipment required for the processes. This information, updated regularly, helps to educate all employees on the current status of covered processes. The chemical hazards of "

Recommendations resulting from the PHA are promptly addressed following the completion of the review. Resolutions to the recommendations are performed and documented as soon as possible and a schedule for resolution of recommendations resulting from the PHA is developed and kept on-file in the PSM program. \n\n \n\n\n\n3.3  Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe PSM program has documented procedures for each operating phase of US Vanadium's processes covered by the PSM program. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each department are kept on the server for electronic access. These SOPs are also readily accessible to employees. The SOPs are revised as needed as part of their ongoing review and reflect the most current operating practices of the covered processes.
