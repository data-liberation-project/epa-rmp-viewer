Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response policies\n\nWe, the Galesburg Water Division - Oquawka Facility are committed to employee, public and enviromental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the Galesburg Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility which is Chlorine.\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 10000 lbs.\n\n3.
