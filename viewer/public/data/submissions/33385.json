There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year history period or in the history of the plant.\n\nIn 1996, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plants. A PSM Implementation Manual was edited to be site specific for each Water Plant. The Manual was issued to the plants. In 1999 the Manual was expanded to address the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nKey items included in the updated manual are:\n\no A written Management Program defining the positions and individuals responsible for implementing the RMP and PSM regulations\n\no Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits\n\no Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\no Standard Operating Procedures for safe Chlorine Management\n\no A Mechanical Integrity Program for chlorine equipment \n\no An Emergency Response Plan to address chlorine emergencies and offsite response and communication\n\nNext, these steps have been continually implemented to maintain compliance with the PMP/PSM program.\n\no  Training on RMP/PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation;\n\no Conducting periodically Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine process;\n\no Implementing the Mechanical Integrity Program for chlorine regulators, controls and material handling equipments such as cranes\n\no Conducting Self Audits to review compliance with the elements of RMP and PSM\n\no Conducting Chlorine Response Drills.\n\no  Performing an annual review of our Chlorine Operating Procedures\n\nThe Utilities Manager, Safety Officer and several plant operators meet annually to review and update procedures and t"

This process has been proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\n\no Storage of all chlorine cylinders inside a secure building was initiated in 1990. This building will act to contain and control and chlorine release and it improves site security.\n\no The replacement of chlorine with an alternate disinfectant (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) or replacing the one (1) ton chlorine cylinders with 150 cylinders remains under consideration.\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. In 1996, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. The County LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to notify businesses or residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills have been routinely conducted since 1997. The last drill was conducted on May 2, 2004.\n\nIn addition RMP/PSM, the Delta Mills Marketing Company organization has an active Safety Program and an active Safety Committee. There is a Utility representative on the Safety Committee. The Safety Committee meets monthly. Its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. The Safety Manager for the Delta Mills Marketing Company also takes an active role in supporting the Utilities Safety Program.\n\nWithin the Utilities Department, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n- Personal Protective"
