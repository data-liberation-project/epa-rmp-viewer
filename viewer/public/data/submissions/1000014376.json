      "SummaryText": "Northeast Treatment Plant\nRisk Managemant Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe City of Abilene, Texas (City) operates the Northeast Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located at 4210 East Lake Road Taylor County, Texas near Fort Phantom Hill Lake on the outskirts of the City of Abilene.  The WTP provides potable water to the City of Abilene, as well as to wholesale customers supplied through neighboring communities and water supply corporations. Chlorine gas and anhydrous ammonia are used in the disinfection process at the Northeast plant.  Up to 24,000 pounds of chlorine and 47,887 pounds of anhydrous ammonia may be stored at the Northeast plant. Because the stored quantity of chlorine and ammonia onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for both chemicals (A?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Northeast plant is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (A?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the CityA?s Director of Water Utilities (Director) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \n\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine and ammonia storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine and ammonia systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturersA? r"

      "SummaryText": "ecommendations (A?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine or ammonia release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (A?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews, and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (A?68.50 & A?68.58).\n\nThe Northeast plant complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR A?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute and in 29 CFR A?1910.111 for anhydrous ammonia.  The Northeast WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response. The City of AbileneA?s Office of Emergency Management maintains a community-wide Emergency Response Plan which encompasses the Northeast plant. Per the CityA?s Emergency Response Plan WTP operators are trained to notify the CityA?s Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the Northeast plant.  The City of AbileneA?s Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the CityA?s Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (A?68.90(b)).  \n\n"
