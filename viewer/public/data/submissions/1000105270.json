The Control Room Operator assumes initial communications with the site over emergencies until relieved by either the Plant Manager or Operations Manager.\n\nEmergency Response Personnel: Fire, police, and/or ambulance crews will be called as necessary.\nThe senior employee on-site during the incident will report to the person in charge of the emergency teams. This report will include currently known causes and effects, reports of injured personnel and their locations, etc. All other employees are instructed to stay clear unless specifically requested to assist in some manner.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: The plant has been operating safely for many years. Ormat will continue to ensure extensive training for the operators as they are essential to plant safety. In addition to implementing recommendations generated by the PHA, Ormat will continue to evaluate any new mitigation or control technology that may improve safety at the Brady Geothermal Power Plant."

The recommendations of the PHA were integrated into the facility and facility operations. The PHA will be updated and revalidated at least every five years to ensure the study is consistent for the life of the OEC processes.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases of normal butane or iso-pentane.  \n\nEmergency Response Program:  The Emergency Action Plan is intended to identify and coordinate personnel in the event there is an emergency. The EAP procedures apply to all personnel working at the Brady Geothermal facility.  The EAP is submitted to the local fire department for review and approval when changes are made to the plan. The following information was selectively excerpted from the Brady Geothermal Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\n\nMotive Fluid Leak or Fire Emergencies: An emergency is identified as any fire, explosion, or motive fluid spill (ruptured vessel, process pipe, etc.) within the plant. Under no circumstances is any person to put himself/herself in danger. A General Response and Action Chart has been prepared to guide the initial response and follow-up actions in case of a motive fluid vapor, smoke, or fire detection alarm.\n\nImplementation, Control, and Compliance: The Operations and Maintenance Manager is responsible for developing and implementing the Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Plan shall be reviewed annually to verify regulatory compliance and accuracy with both OSHA Regulations on\nEmergency Plans 29, CFR 1910.38 and NDEP-CAPP's Emergency Response Programs, NAC\n459.9544. The Emergency Response Program must also be periodically reviewed and updated, and employees must be notified of any changes in conformance with 40 CFR 68.95. The EAP may also be reviewed during Incident Investigations or when required during the Management of Change. Current copies of the Emergency Action Plan are located in the Brady Geoth"

Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. \n\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the storage tank, OEC vaporizers, and condensers. Each pressure relief valve relieves directly to the atmosphere, and some installations have extension pipes installed to direct the relief valve discharge away from critical machinery. Additionally, each pressure relief valve is installed immediately above a rupture disk designed to fail at the relief pressure of its corresponding relief valve. Individual relief valve locations are equipped with telltale gauges between the relief valve and its rupture disk to easily identify leaking or blown rupture disks.\n\nVentilation System Design: All components of the motive fluid transfer and storage system and the\nOEC units are located outdoors and well-ventilated.\n\nSafety Systems: Beyond the relief system, the Brady OEC units have extensive fire protection, detection, and alarming systems and an administrative control system for fire prevention.\nThe fire detection systems include gas monitors, continuously monitoring the area surrounding the OECs, and multi-spectrum infrared flame detectors throughout the plant. The facility has a fire water loop around the plant within reach of the OECs and storage tanks. The fire water loops consist of fire pumps, water tanks, monitors, hydrants, and a deluge system for the iso-pentane storage tank.  The butane storage tank is coated with fireproofing insulation that prevents the tank shell from overheating for up to two hours without fire water application to help prevent a tank boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion.  Operators are trained in properly using the installed fire protection equipment, and the facility operator appropriately documents the training information.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), including Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, an"

Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the site hazards. These subjects include Emergency Action Plan (EAP), motive fluid hazards, fire prevention and hot work, lock-out and tag-out procedures, hazard communication, confined space, hearing conservation, personal protective equipment, accident, injury, and incident reporting. Safety training is supplemented by the use of Standard Safety Procedures.\n\nOEC Units: The OEC units are controlled and monitored by their own dedicated Programmable\nLogic Controller (PLC). The PLC receives all discrete (logic) and analog signals from the input devices (e.g., switches and measuring sensors), processes the signals according to pre-loaded Ormat software, and then outputs logic and analog command signals to local and field devices.

The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubricating rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify the system is operating correctly. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled over a series of maintenance intervals.

      "SummaryText": "Brady Geothermal Power Plant Risk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary (revision 2, May 10, 2023)\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBrady Power Partner's policy is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The Brady\nGeothermal facility actively manages all operational permits and safety programs, such as Nevada\nDepartment of Environmental Protection Air Quality, Chemical Accident Prevention Program,\nUnderground Injection Control as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management. Ormat is committed to handling flammable motive fluid systems in a safe manner to protect the environment. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses, and all other process safety management are maintained onsite for reference or are available electronically.\n\nFacility Description\nBrady Power Partners wholly own the Brady Geothermal Power Plant. The Brady\nGeothermal facility is located in Churchill County. The physical plant is located at 7042 Old Highway\n40, east of Fernley, Nevada. The leased acreage covers the defined geothermal resource area and reinjection zones.\n\nPrior to March 2018, the Brady facility consisted of three steam-powered turbines and one OEC (Ormat Energy Converter), aka existing OEC.  Since then, Ormat has added one new OEC and just recently completed the revamp of the existing OEC.  The new OEC process is named OEC-1, and the existing OEC process is named OEC-2.  The three steam-powered turbines have been decommissioned.\n\nThis RMP submission reflects the new OEC-1 and the revamped process, OEC-2. \n\nUnder the current configuration, Brady is supplied hot geothermal brine from six pumped production wells.  OEC-1 and OEC-2 process the brine through a closed loop, binary Rankine Cycle.  The hot brine circulates through the tube side of the shell and tube heat exchangers to preheat and vaporize the motive fluid on the shell side.  In the binary Rankine Cycle, the normal butane (motive fluid for OEC-1) and iso-pentane (motive fl"
