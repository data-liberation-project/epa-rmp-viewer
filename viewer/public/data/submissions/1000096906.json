Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nTaylor Farms Schilling facility conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response.\n\n\n\nOn-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2.    Description of Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe Taylor Farms Schilling facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 of the RMP binder for the drawings showing the facility location map and site plan.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage and water chilling. The refrigeration system at the facility includes, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, screw and reciprocating compressors, cold room evaporative cooling coils, falling film water chillers, a plate frame heat exchanger, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. The facility has six cold rooms housing air-cool evaporators: the Raw Product Room, Cold Room A, Cold Room B, Co"

The reciprocating compressors at the equipment yard are pumped down and two of the water chillers are moved to Taylor Farms Food Service Facility in Yuma, AZ during wintertime.\n\n\n\nFacility has a refrigeration machinery room that houses the screw compressors, one of the reciprocating compressors, low pressure receiver and ammonia pumps. All remaining equipment, except the cold room fan coils, is located outdoors.   \n\n\n\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Low pressure receiver has high level float switch that shuts down the screw compressors and the reciprocating compressor in the engine room when it senses high liquid level in the vessel. \n\n\n\nRefrigeration control panel inside the electrical room schedules the fan coil defrost times and monitors the ammonia detectors inside the cold rooms and the engine room. Ammonia detection system sends alarms to a third-party alarm company (Precision Alarm & Automation), which in return calls the listed facility personnel in case of ammonia detection in the cold rooms or engine room. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are assigned responders (refrigeration contractors) experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident. \n\n\n\nThe total ammonia charge of the refrigeration system at the facility is approximately 12,230 lb. \n\n\n\nRefrigeration system drawings are located in the Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 (Refrigeration System Drawings) of the RMP Binder. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder.

In general, the process chemistry for the refrigeration system is provided in Chapter 8 of the RMP Binder. Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTaylor Farms Schilling facility maintains a release prevention program to prevent or mitigate releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix 16 - Incident Investigation of the RMP Binder.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators, contractors and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency reporting and monitoring and assisting local emergency responders in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches in the equipment yard for shutting down the king valve and liquid injection valve. Ammonia detectors are installed in all of the refrigerated rooms and the engine room. The alarm company (Precision Alarm & Automation) notifies the personnel in the list, if any detector exceeds its set point.

Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Taylor Farms Schilling personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program   \n\nTaylor Farms Schilling facility is a \"Non-Responding\" facility. Facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to Compliance Manager, and Refrigeration Manager. The Compliance Manager is responsible for assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Compliance Manager will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some recommendation items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Proc"
