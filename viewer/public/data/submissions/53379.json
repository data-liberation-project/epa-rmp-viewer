They look to us for excellent value, dependable delivery, consistent formulas and hands-on service. Since our inception in 1971, our simple goal has been to be the most reliable and responsive company in our industry.  The CSM Bakery Products management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surround communities.  CSM Bakery ProductsA? safety and environmental policies are administered by the Corporate Safety & Risk Manager, who oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program for the anhydrous ammonia systems and the CalARP Program for the aqueous ammonia system.\n\nCSM Bakery Products employees conduct ongoing inspections, testing, and replacement of the critical items in the ammonia refrigeration systems and the aqueous ammonia system.  The aqueous ammonia system is monitored during daily rounds by the Facility Supervisor.   The ammonia refrigeration system is inspected daily by the Facility Coordinator.  A record of the maintenance or work performed on the systems is maintained onsite.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe CSM Bakery Products facility is located at 2111 West Valley Blvd. in Colton, California.  The facility is located approximately 0.1 mile north of the Interstate 10 and approximately 3.1 miles west of Highway 215.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is primarily urban with light commercial and residential areas.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes are used for the chilling and storage of a variety of food products in their processing area and cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, "

Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from 11A? Hg to 30 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 150-180 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the two separate and independent refrigeration processes.  The ammonia inventory in the original system is 19,100 pounds, while the second system (July 2001) contains an ammonia inventory of 22,500 pounds. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR), the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia (29%) above the threshold quantity.\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\nA? IIAR Bulletin 107, A?Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-insA?\nA?

There are also ammonia detectors located throughout the facility.  There are sensors within Machine Room 1's Freezers, Cooler Dock, Processing Area, and Cooler Room which will alarm at 25 ppm.  The visual and audible alarms are activated at the Freezer Room entrance and a signal is sent to the central computer and is logged within alarm history and will wait for operator response, otherwise, if time occurs, operators are paged.  An initial shutdown occurs at 125 ppm which does the following: (1) Evaporator fans turned off, (2) Evaporator liquid supply and hot gas valves are closed, and (3) Fire department is notified.  There are also ammonia sensors within the Machine Room 1 which will have the following actions at 125 ppm:  (1) Shut down of solenoid valves in order to isolate the ammonia, (2) The purge ventilation fan is turned on with a manual reset required, (3) scrubbing system pumps and fans are turned on with a manual reset required, and (4) Signal is sent to notify operator (refrigeration contractor).  Audible and visual alarms are activated in the Machine Room and a signal is sent ot an auto dialer to alert opreators.  Security Link is instructed to call the fire dpartment.

January 2009).  On August 25, 2008, there was an ammonia release through a relief valve located on the roof at 216 psig and the discharge temperature was 178oF for 90 minutes.  Approximately 1,413 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released into the diffusion tank.  This was due to the burn out of the condenser fan which caused the cooling system to fail and ammonia pressure to rise.  Also, the evaporative condenser spray nozzles and filters were clogged and dirty which inhibited the ventilation system.  The water spray nozzles/distributors are not functioning as designed; therefore, the water is"

In addition, the emergency exhaust fan did not work because the power was cut when the circuit breaker activated by the burn out of the condenser motor.  The ammonia alarm sounded due to a smell of ammonia outside the ammonia room.  All employees at the plant were evacuated and the fire department was automatically notified.  The fire department arrived and assessed the situation.  The fire department ordered all persons to stay out of the plant until they gave the all clear.  CSM Bakery Products later called SCS Tracer Environmental, formerly known as Tracer ES&T, to be part of the incident investigation team.  SCS Tracer Environmental recommended CSM Bakery Products to do the following:\n\n1.    Change the relief valve\n2.    Change the electrical source to the emergency exhaust fan\n3.    Add other computer access location outside the ammonia room \n\nThe facility has completed the following tasks:  1) replaced the electric fan motor was replaced, 2) cleaned the Evaporative CondensersA? nozzles and filter, 3) changed the electrical wiring so the the electrical source of the emergency exhaust fan system is independent of the evaporative condenser fan motor, and 4) add computer access location outside of the ammonia room.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCSM Bakery Products has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  In the case of an ammonia-related or an aqueous ammonia related emergency, facility management will determine if an evacuation is necessary.  It is the policy of CSM Bakery Products to evacuate the employees and call 911 in order to reach the San Bernardino County Fire Department HazMat team who will respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel). \n\nEmployees and contractors of CSM Bakery Products are obligated to report any significant releases or po"
