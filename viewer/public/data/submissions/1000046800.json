( Ethox ) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Ethox established a system to ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Part of this system is a Risk Management Program that helps manage potential risks at Ethox and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One requirement of the rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at Ethox.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Ethox.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nEthox is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  A comprehensive accidental release prevention program is in place that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Ethox policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such a release does occur, Ethox is completely coordinated with Donaldson Center Fire Department which provides trained emergency response personnel to assist in the control and to mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility's primary activity is the manufacturing of Surface Active Chemicals.  There are two regulated substances present at the facility: Ethylene oxide [Oxirane] (EO) and Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] (PO). EO and PO are used for manufacturing detergents, emulsifiers and wetting agents. The maximum inven"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with (NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition).  A number of processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at Ethox.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nEthox maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Leader 2.3 process sections and deviations.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, Ethox maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nEthox has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associ"

Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nEthox carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Ethox to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ethox.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nEthox conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nEthox promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic rele"
