As part of this commitment, the Company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility and plans to continue those safe work practices. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Port Hudson. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n1.a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide) - see topic 1.3\n\n\n\n2.a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n\n\n3.an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at GP/Port Hudson.

Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nGP/Port Hudson limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at GP/Port Hudson consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule. This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nGP/Port Hudson is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers"

As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores chlorine dioxide (C102) for use in the bleaching process. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nGP/Port Hudson performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substance to affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release case scenario. The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like GP/Port Hudson and (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred. The alternative release scenario will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the end-point distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance"

These documents are also used, (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazard analysis, and (3) to help maintain the equipment to the design specification.\n\n\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis.  GP/Port Hudson performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process. The facility primarily uses the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) and/or \"What If\" technique, supplemented with a checklist, to perform this analysis. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to personnel and changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n\n\n4. Operating Procedures. GP/Port Hudson operators, supervisors, and engineers work together to develop and maintain accurate operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures are, (1) used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and upset operating conditions. The operating procedures include:\n\n\n\n-Steps for safely conducting activities\n\n\n\n-Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\n\n\n\n-Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\n\n\n\nThe facility personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of the operations, including initial start-up, normal o"
