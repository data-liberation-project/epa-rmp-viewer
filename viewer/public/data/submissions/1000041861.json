The GP/Port Hudson Management of Change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be replacements in kind are allowed without completing a management of change procedure. All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of the process changes are prevented, safety concerns are addressed, affected process safety information and operating procedures are updated, and affected employees are consulted on the changes.\r\n\r\n11. Incident Investigations.  GP/Port Hudson investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented. The facility trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. An incident investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigations are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\r\n\r\n12. Compliance Audits.  GP/Port Hudson audits the covered processes to be certain that the facility's prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the operations. The facility assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP Rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP Rule and also whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operations of the process.

At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects could be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects could be less.\r\n\r\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g.,  eye or throat irritation) are likely.\r\n\r\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Port Hudson Operations. These requirements include:\r\n\r\none worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\r\none alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\r\n\r\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Georgia-Pacific Port Hudson Operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process- Chlorine Dioxide (C102) Solution System\r\n\r\nIn accordance with EPA changes to the RMP rule, Georgia-Pacific does not present worst case or alternative case release simulation information in this summary. \r\n\r\n\r\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nGeorgia-Pacific Port Hudson Operations has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 Prevention Program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the program also focuses on protecti"

These documents are also used, (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazard analysis, and (3) to help maintain the equipment to the design specification.\r\n\r\n3. Process Hazard Analysis.  GP/Port Hudson performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process. The facility primarily uses the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) and/or \"What If\" technique, supplemented with a checklist, to perform this analysis. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to personnel and changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\r\n\r\n4. Operating Procedures. GP/Port Hudson operators, supervisors, and engineers work together to develop and maintain accurate operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures are, (1) used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and upset operating conditions. The operating procedures include:\r\n\r\n-Steps for safely conducting activities\r\n\r\n-Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\r\n\r\n-Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\r\n\r\nThe facility personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of the operations, including initial start-up, normal o"
