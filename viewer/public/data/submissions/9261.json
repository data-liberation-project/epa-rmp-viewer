This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  As of May 1999, employees headquartered at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant have worked almost 3 million work-hours without a lost time accident.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained facility personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES     \n\nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant is located near Paradis, Louisiana at 15849 Old Spanish Trail (LA Hwy. 631).  The processes operated at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant include: cyrogenic natural gas processing  (currently out of service with no immediate plans for commencement of service); a natural gas liquid fractionating process; and product storage and shipping.  Product shipping is either by truck, rail or pipeline.  Operations at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant consist of the following:  (1) Raw natural gas from producers is dehydrated to remove moisture.  (2) Raw natural gas is cryogenically processed to separate the lighter hydrocarbons (primarily methane gas) from the heavier hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane, and pentane plus products) by liquefying the heavier hydrocarbons into a combined stream (natural gas liquids).  Note: The cryogenic processes at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant are currently out of service with no immediate plans for commencement of service. (3) Natural gas liquids from either"

      "SummaryText": " the on-site cryogenic processes (currently out of service) or other off-site sources are fractionated into individual hydrocarbon products  (ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane and pentane pluses).  (4) The individual hydrocarbon products, with the exception of ethane, are temporarily stored on-site in pressurized vessels prior to shipping.  (5) Ethane is delivered directly into a pipeline.  Other individual hydrocarbon products can be transferred to trucks for shipping at a truck rack, transferred to railcars for shipping at a rail rack, or delivered into pipelines.\n\nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant routinely handles quantities of natural gas, ethane, propane, normal butane and iso-butane, all of which are regulated substances and above the threshold limits listed in EPA's Risk Management Program rule. \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS    \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for the Paradis Gas Processing Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest inventory of a flammable mixture (predominately consisting of normal butane) contained in a single pressurized storage vessel.  The maximum quantity possible contained within this storage vessel is 1,780,720 pounds.  Although administrative controls are in place to limit this quantity, those controls were not considered in calculating this maximum quantity determination.  The entire inventory of the storage tank is assumed to release, form a vapor cloud, ignite and explode - creating a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the 1-psig overpressure endpoint is 1.0 mile. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases, and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) that is used as a planning case at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant is an overfill of Propane Storage Vessel No. 18, causing a relief valve to operate as designed and release propane t"

The released propane is ignited causing a vapor cloud fire (VCF).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the lower flammability limit endpoint for this scenario is 0.1 mile. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant.  Because processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements, and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n \n  Employee Participation\n \nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant has a written Employee Participation Plan that encourages participation in process safety management and accident prevention. The purpose of this Employee Participation Plan is to provide facility employees and affected contractors with information and instructions that encourage them to participate in the Paradis Gas Processing Plant's process safety management and risk management practices and procedures.  The intent of those practices and procedures is to identify, evaluate and mitigate, or prevent unwanted and potentially hazardous releases of highly hazardous chemicals (flammables).  Employees and affected contractors working in and around the Paradis Gas Processing Plant's hazardous processes are entitled, and encouraged, to participate in the development, implementation and improvement of process safety management and risk management program compliance efforts.\n\nParticipation in the development of the Paradis "

Employees and affected contractors have access to information developed as part of the facility's PSM and accident prevention program. \n \n Process Safety Information\n \nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant has a variety of technical documents on site which are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents define the process chemicals, technology and equipment that are utilized at the facility and address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The facility maintains documents for process streams and products which provide fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity hazards, and safety and health hazards to workers; process chemistry information addressing the thermal and chemical stability of the hazardous chemicals, including over-pressure hazards; and block flow diagrams defining the process technology.\n \n Chemical-specific information including exposure hazards, emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, and corrosivity/reactivity data is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's).  For specific process areas, information concerning safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) is provided in operating procedures.  The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is examined to identify potential hazards, determine if adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n \n The Paradis Gas Processing Plant uses a variety and combination of applicable methodologies to conduct PHAs.  These PHAs address: facility siting; human factors; qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel; and one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process: What-if; Checklist; Hazard and Operability (HAZOP); Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA); Fault Tree Analysis; or an appropriate equivalent methodology. PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n \n The PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of recommendations is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n \n The facility revalidates PHAs at least every 5 years.  PHA revalidations will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating and do not contain over the threshold quantities of hazardous substances.
