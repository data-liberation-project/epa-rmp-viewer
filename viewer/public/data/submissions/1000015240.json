Hill Brothers Chemical Company staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these chemicals.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n \nHill Brothers Chemical Company policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and CalARP.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company trains its employees at this facility to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.

A designated Emergency Coordinator (EC) and an alternate EC initiate emergency notifications and evacuations.  All employees are trained in their appropriate role in emergency response and proper procedures for awareness level response.  The City of Industry Facility maintains a cooperative relationship with the Fire Department to ensure a full understanding of normal storage practices and emergency response and evacuation procedures related to regulated substances.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nCity of Industry Facility stores, repackages, and distributes anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, aqueous ammonia is manufactured at the facility.  The facility also stores and distributes 150-pound chlorine cylinders to customers.  \n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Unloading System (Aqueous Ammonia Production)\n\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Production Process manufactures aqueous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is pumped from the transport vehicle and mixed with water in a reaction chamber to produce aqueous ammonia.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Unloading System (Refrigeration Grade Ammonia)\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Unloading System is used for unloading transport vehicles directly into either the Storage Tank or the tank trucks.  The Storage Tank is used to transfer anhydrous ammonia to the tank truck.  Several safety mechanisms (i.e., scrubber, excess flow valves, emergency shutoff switch) are incorporated into the design of the system\n.\nAnhydrous Ammonia Repackaging, Storage and Distribution Process\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Repackaging, Storage and Distribution Process consists of a truck unloading station, a pressurized storage tank, a holding vessel and pump for cylinder filling, a cylinder fill station, ammonia recovery equipment, piping and valves.  The system stores and repackages anhydrous ammonia for distribu"

All cylinders are inspected upon arrival at the facility to ensure that they meet all applicable safety codes.  Defective cylinders, including those missing safety caps, are returned to the supplier.  Cylinders are restrained in the upright position during transport and storage.  The chlorine is shipped in cylinders compliant with DOT requirements. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has a PSM program in place to manage the handling of ammonia and chlorine, which complies with Federal RMP, CalARP and PSM requirements.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqueous Ammonia\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company prevention program emphasizes risk management through use of equipment rated for ammonia service; training for its employees in hazard communication; proper operating procedures for the ammonia systems; level, pressure and temperature limits for process equipment and storage tanks; implementation of programs to maintain the mechanical integrity of equipment; internal auditing and inspection programs; procedures to address change within the p"

Hill Brothers Chemical Company standard operating procedures include routine observation of equipment condition during daily start-up procedures, production procedures, and daily shutdown procedures.  Two trained operators are always present during bulk transfer to ensure safe operation and movement of trucks on the property and the integrity of hoses used for filling.  Operators are always present during repackaging operations to observe pressure and temperature gauges on tanks and pipes and to be alert for any releases of pressure relief valves installed on tanks or hydrostats on piping systems. In accordance with DOT requirements, valve assemblies on anhydrous ammonia cylinders are inspected upon each return for refilling.  Faulty valves are rebuilt or replaced.  The date stamped for hydrostatic testing of cylinders is checked and each cylinder is repainted for corrosion protection before refilling.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company trains their operators carefully before allowing them to take the lead in repackaging operations.  A key training method for process operations involves on-the-job supervision over extended time periods, using repeated demonstration of correct process steps in accordance with written procedures. \n\nChlorine\n\nWith respect to the chlorine cylinder warehouse process, Hill Brothers Chemical Company standard operating procedures include routine observation of container integrity during loading and unloading of these cylinders.  Two people are always present during loading and unloading to ensure safe container handling using forklifts or hand trucks.  Cylinders are stored upright, caps on, and strapped or chained in accordance with OSHA requirements for compressed gases.  Cylinders are all DOT compliant and they are maintained during every refill by the supplier.  In addition to PSM, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are strictly followed.  Also, common practice"

This incident occurred on March 9, 2009 at approximately 8:15 am.  At the time of the incident, two Hill Brothers Chemical Company employees were on top of the Refrigeration Grade Ammonia transport vehicle.  One employee began connecting the liquid adapter to the transport vehicle while another was tightening a fitting on the corresponding valve.  As the employee was tightening the fitting, the valve opened slightly and released ammonia vapor directly onto the other employee.  The injured employee immediately rinsed his face with water and was sent to the local clinic for further observations.  After the incident, the faulty valve was repaired, an air actuated valve was connected to the transport vehicle, and facility operating procedures were updated to better protect employees. \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company is taking additional steps to further public safety.  Several studies have been conducted recently to examine mitigation measures and additional steps to further ensure public safety at the Hill Brothers Chemical Company City of Industry Facility.  The changes primarily include detailed reviews and updates of formal operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures to address comments and recommended actions identified through various analyses.  All recommended changes from the Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review and Seismic Assessment have been reviewed and implemented."
