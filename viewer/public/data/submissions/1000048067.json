The facility produces agricultural fertilizer for use in surrounding areas.  Kugler Oil Company, the parent of UDF is a family owned corporation located in McCook, Nebraska.  The owners live in McCook, surrounded by friends and neighbors who are also their customers.  The principal officers of the parent company as well as the manager of UDF and most of the employees are all very active in the affairs of their local communities and are as interested in the health and welfare of their neighbors as they are of their own families.\n\n\n\nThe facility has two 30,000 gallon (maximum capacity) pressure vessels for the storage of anhydrous ammonia used in the manufacture of liquid fertilizer. In addition there exists the   capability  to store a considerable amount of liquid fertilizer on site.  The other chemicals used and stored at this facility are not considered hazardous or are stored below the threshold amounts to be considered under Part 68 of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nIn constructing this plan, many alternative scenarios were envisioned which  could involve the accidental release of ammonia gas from  the anhydrous ammonia tanks.  The most probable of these unlikely scenarios might be the release of excess pressure due to natural solar heating of an overfilled anhydrous ammonia storage tank. With the release of 100 pounds of liquid material over a ten minute period, the maximum predicted travel of the resulting vapor cloud would only involve about six persons within the two residences  within a 0.2 mile radius.  \n\n\n\nThe Kugler Oil Company has always been very pro-active in meeting accepted industry standards for storage and handling of the various chemicals with which they deal.  Safety is of paramount concern and to that end they hire an internal Director of Safety,  provide for a Safety Committee that meets regularly and in addit"

      "SummaryText": "ion work with a loss control consultant.   Part of the Management Directive for the company Safety Program states that It is the intent of management that full implementation of the safety program will benefit this facility, and as such it is a high priority of the facility.  The benefits will include preventing accidents, reducing overall operating costs by reducing down time, repair costs, time and costs spent in training new employees, reducing workers compensation claims costs, and increasing productivity through a better trained and motivated workforce.  To this end, it is the responsibility of management to provide a workplace free of  hazards.  By extension the safety of the community  surrounding our facilities is of as much concern as for our employees as ourselves.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely scenario where an ammonia vapor cloud would leave the premises of the UDF, our employees are trained to inform the local population. Coordination has been effected with the Grant County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) whose agencies can provide for notification of those residents likely to be affected so that they may evacuate the area.  The Ulysses fire department has been onsite and performed walk throughs.  The most recent was April 1st, 2014. \n\n\n\nThe Kugler Company at this and all similar locations requires that all materials and procedures meet the State of Kansas and Industry Standards ANSI K61.1 for construction of Ammonia handling facilities.  The Kansas Department Agriculture regularly inspects this facility to assure integrity of materials and equipment.  UDF personnel are regularly trained on the maintenance and operation of all facility equipment. Our goal is to be a good neighbor and maintain an operation in consonance with the natural environment and the surrounding residents.\n\n\n\nSince the time of its acquisition in 1976, there has been only one recordable release.
