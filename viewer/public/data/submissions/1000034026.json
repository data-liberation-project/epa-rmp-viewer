              "Description": "Ammonia Process\n\n\n\nIn November 2011, the anhydrous ammonia tank was replaced with a new smaller tank, almost a third of the size of the previous tank.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia neutralization process is a batch process in which acids are neutralized with anhydrous ammonia (NH3) in an atmospheric tank with agitator (blend tank) or a pressure vessel (reactor). The ammonia flow to the reactors and blend vessels is controlled so that almost all of the ammonia is absorbed.  Any excess ammonia is vented to the plant thermal oxidizer, where it is burned. Safety relief devices are installed on the reactor to prevent catastrophic failure of the reactor should an unlikely over-pressurization occur. Over-pressurization is not possible on the atmospheric tanks, so no relief system is necessary on the blend vessels.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is stored onsite in a 265 psig rated pressure vessel. The ammonia tank is equipped with pressure relief valve, all outlets on the tank have an excess flow valve combination, and there is an excess flow valve on the line to the plant.   All pressure relief valve and excess flow valves are on a regular PM schedule.  Check valves are also installed at the vessel to prevent backflow of potential contaminants to the storage vessel.  The ammonia tank is equipped with a high and high high level alarm.  The tank is inspected by a third party for external once every five years and internal once every ten years.  Perimeter monitoring alarms are installed on all four sides of the tank.\n\n\n\nThe loading of the storage tank from a delivery truck is accomplished by use of a closed loop vapor recycle system in which the vapor ammonia is pumped from the top of the tank truck by a compressor to the bottom of the storage tank, and the ammonia vapor from the top of the storage tank is recycled back to the tank truck so that no ammonia is exhausted to the atmosphere. The plant operator and truck driver manage the following: the connection of the truck to the storage vessel, the unloading of the truck, and the uncoupling of the truck from the storage tank. The plant operators and truck drivers have been trained and are experienced in the safe handling of ammonia.  There is a written ammonia unloading procedures which is updated annually.  \n\n\n\nA process hazards analysis (PHA) has been conducted on the process from truck delivery to reactor operation and finished product. Written operating procedures are in place to ensure ongoing integrity of the process equipment and piping. Inspections include ultrasound thickness tests and visual inspection of glasslined reactors. Leaking pumps, lines and valves are tagged and repaired by maintenance in a timely manner.\n\n",

              "Description": "Sulfur Dioxide Process\n\n\n\nThe sulfur dioxide neutralization process is a batch process in which amines are neutralized with the sulfur dioxide (SO2) in a pressure vessel (reactor). The sulfur dioxide flow to the reactors is controlled so that the majority of the sulfur dioxide is reacted.  Any excess SO2 remaining after the reaction is consumed by the plant scrubber system. The plant thermal oxidizer system suppresses emission of SO2 to the atmosphere. Nitrogen (N2) is used to purge the SO2 delivery lines from the storage vessel to the reactor.\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide is stored onsite in a 250 psig rated pressure vessel. The sulfur dioxide tank is equipped with pressure relief valve, all outlets on the tank have an excess flow valve combination, and there is an excess flow valve on the line to the plant.   Check valves are also installed at the reactor to prevent backflow of potential contaminants to the storage vessel.  The sulfur dioxide tank is equipped with a high and high high level alarm.  The tank is inspected by a third party for external once every five years and internal once every ten years.  \n\n\n\nThe SO2 storage tank is loaded from a delivery truck by the use of a closed loop compressed vapor system between the storage tank and the delivery truck to prevent emissions of SO2 to the atmosphere. Plant process operators, supervisors, and delivery truck drivers have been formally trained in the safe handling and loading/unloading of SO2. Operator training is conducted on a yearly basis. A process hazard analysis (PHA) has been conducted on the SO2 storage and batch reaction systems.  Perimeter monitoring alarms are installed on all four sides of the tank.\n\n\n\nA process hazards analysis (PHA) has been conducted on the process from truck delivery to reactor operation and finished product. Written operating procedures are in place to ensure ongoing integrity of the process equipment and piping. Inspections include ultrasound thickness tests and visual inspection of glasslined reactor. Leaking pumps, lines and valves are tagged and repaired by maintenance in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nHistorically the Plant had a SO2 bisulfite process, however this is no longer performed onsite per MOC#  GM-ODE-2013-P-3165.\n\n\n\nThe maximum volume of sulfur dioxide in the pressurized tank is reduced to approximately 65% of the tank volume capacity  by using administrative controls (procedures) and engineering controls (high and high high level alarms).  The high level is set at 58% tank volume capacity and high high level is set at 65% tank volume capacity.  Documentation is available to verify that the site has not exceeded 65% volume of sulfur dioxide in the tank for over 2 years.\n\n",

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Odessa Plant predominately uses the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) technique to perform Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for review.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n4.4 Operating Procedures\n\nThe Odessa Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  The procedures clearly state operating limits, consequences for deviation, and appropriate responses for deviation.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary. These procedures are reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate. The operating procedures are available in the company intranet (SharePoint) and a hard copy of the procedures that is updated quarterly is also available in case of power outage on a thumb drive.  \n\n\n\n4.5 Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Odessa Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own before they can work independently.
