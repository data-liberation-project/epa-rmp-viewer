Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Odessa Plant predominately uses the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) technique to perform Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for review. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive attention first. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Odessa Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n4.4 Operating Procedures\n\nThe Odessa Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  The procedures clearly state operating limits, consequences for deviation, and appropriate responses for deviation.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary. These procedures are reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate. The operating procedures are available in the company intranet (SharePoint) and a hard copy of the procedures that is updated quarterly is also available in case of power outage on a thumb drive.  \n\n\n\n4.5 Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Odessa Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own before they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a competent level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, contractors are evaluated with respect to their existing programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. High risk contractors are periodically monitored to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n4.7 Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Odessa Plant conducts a PSSR for any new plant modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.
