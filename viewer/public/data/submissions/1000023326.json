In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We maintain this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The Smith Dairy Company Milk Process facility is located at 230 North Vine Street, Orville, Ohio. We manufacture dairy products. The facility has processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. \n\nThe Milk Processing Facility refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains approximately 16,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Smith Dairy Company has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, avoid property damage, and offsite impacts.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communica"

The purpose of an MI program is to maintain process equipment so that a catastrophic release of ammonia is avoided or properly contained. The emphasis should be on preventive maintenance rather than breakdown maintenance.\n\nMany more specific programs and policies (Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout / Tagout, Employee training, etc..) have been developed..\n\nProcedures for conducting Compliance Audits, Mechanical Integrity Inspections, and Process Hazard Analyses have also been developed.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Re-validation was completed  August 2nd and 4th, 2011..  The PHA highlighted some deficiencies in the system. These items were addressed as part of the continuous improvement of the facility. These items were addressed on the basis of priority (Injuries to personnel).\n\nThe facility has developed Process and Instrumentation Diagrams for the individual system components. Flow schematics are included showing the entire system. A Block flow diagram provides a brief overview of the system. Drawings are included showing symbol and abbreviation descriptions. Plan views are included to allow the operator to physically locate equipment in the building.\n\nThe  facility has a complete set of standard operating procedures, describing the proper steps for preparing components for start-up, starting components, monitoring normal operation of system components, shutting down components as part of normal operation, restarting equipment as part of normal operation, shutting down equipment for maintenance, restarting equipment after maintenance, shutting down equipment in emergency situations, restarting equipment after an emergency situations shutdown, and pumpout procedures.
