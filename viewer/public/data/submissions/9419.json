The ammonia and ammonia solution are then used in the production of fertilizers.  The facility has been in operation since 1911.\n \nRoyster-Clark Americus Plant has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process.\n\nThe facility safety record is a direct result of much emphasis on safety in the plant on the part of management and employees. \n\nB.\tAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\nThe facility is in compliance with OSHA PSM Standards.  Information for P&ID drawings, operations procedures, Management of Change (MOC) documents, and other pertinent documents are on file at the plant office.   The Americus, GA, EHS staff furnishes technical assistance and performs safety and environmental audits and training on a regular basis.\n\nThe ammonia tanks and associated equipment is covered by a mechanical integrity inspection and testing schedule and is constantly monitored. \n\nSafety meetings for all employees are held  at the facility.  In addition, to safety training classes, each employee has taken numerous computer-based safety training courses. All supervisory positions and Hazmat employees are certified in First Aid and CPR.\n\nThe Royster-Clark management personnel are actively involved in promoting safety and environmental awareness in the community through participation with the LEPC and coordination with the Fire Department.\n\nRoyster-Clark believes safety and concerns for the environment must be second nature to all employees and contractor personnel.\n\nC.\tEmergency Response Policies and Program:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Americus granulation facility employees are trained to be familiar with the Emergency Response policies"

All plant personnel have received eight hours of awareness level training as directed by 29 CFR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed on an annual basis as part of the employee safety meetings to ensure refresher training.  Safety policies and procedures are also reviewed on an annual basis or more often if required.  These policies and procedures are also revised to stay in compliance with changing government regulations\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is followed in the event of an emergency.  Included in this plan is the testing of the emergency system each month.\n\nLocal LEPC and Americus Fire Department personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Response Plan and invited to tour the facility on a regular basis.\n\nThe facility Emergency Response Plan covers such things as accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, and emergency response practices and procedures.  The plan is reviewed each year with all employees and reviewed with the local fire department on a regular basis.\n\nThe Americus facility maintains a Hazardous Materials Response Team whose duty is to respond to chemical emergencies at the plant and are also trained as Confined Space Rescue Personnel. The Hazardous Materials Response Team is a volunteer group and has received an initial forty hour training with eight hours of refresher training annually.  The Hazardous Materials Response Team has coordinated training with the local fire department on several occasions.\n\nD.\tWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe facility has two 30,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks on site. Each tank is equipped with four safety relief valves to prevent over pressurization. \n\nThe EPA requires a very conservative worst case scenario to be a catastrophic rupture of that tank with a complete loss of product over 10 minutes. \n\nIt should be noted that the EPA describes the worst-case scenario as:\n\nBecause the assumptions required"

In addition, the worst case analysis is carried out using very conservative assumptions about weather and release conditions.  The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.  (EPA550-B-98-003, Section4.2)\n\nRoyster-Clark Americus used the results of  The Fertilizer Institute's (TFI) Degadis Model.\n\nBecause of past operating experience visual inspections performed on the tanks and operations training Royster-Clark believes the chances for a catastrophic rupture is extremely unlikely.\n\nE.\tAlternative-case Scenario Ammonia:\n\nThe ammonia tanks are filled via railcars.   The most likely release scenario would be a rupture of a transfer hose.  Railcars are unloaded on a frequency of approximately one per week.  The conditions chosen for the alternative scenario are those which would create a maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia lost to the environment.\n\nF.\tAlternative-case Scenario 44.8% nitrogen solution:\n\nThe 44.8% nitrogen solution tanks are filled via railcars.   The most likely release scenario would be a rupture of a transfer hose.  Railcars are unloaded on a frequency of approximately 5 per week.  The conditions chosen for the alternative scenario are those which would create a maximum amount of 44.8% nitrogen solution lost to the environment.\n\nG.\tFive Year Accident History:\n\nRoyster-Clark, Americus, has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its personnel or contractors as a result of the RMP covered process.

Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain that record.\n\nH.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe Americus plant continuously looks for ways to enhance the safety of the plant.  Monthly safety inspections are conducted which result in corrective actions; Process Safety Management audits are conducted every three years; along with, annual Royster-Clark reviews conducted by the environmental health and safety department.\n \nI.\tSummary:  \n\nThe employees of Royster-Clark are extremely proud of its safety record and the vast improvements in both safety and environmental efforts made over the last twenty years.  We believe that with the programs and policies in place, and the continued efforts of 100% of our personnel, we will be able to maintain our safety record and a safe plant environment for all concerned in the years ahead."
