The facility is situated on approximately 31.7 acres located at 10521 Sheldon Road, Houston, Texas 77044.\n\n1.2    ACIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICES\nDelta North Channel is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training on facility processes.  It is Delta North Channel's policy to implement appropriate controls to reduce and prevent the release of regulated substances.  Delta North Channel has trained emergency response personnel on site for release response.\n\n1.3    THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe Delta North Channel facility's primary activities are packaging, warehousing and distribution of chemicals. The regulated substances handled by the facility are listed below.  Delta North Channel receives the regulated substances in bulk tanker trucks, rail cars and iso tanks and transfers them to 55-gallon drums, 275 gallon totes and other smaller containers.  Filled containers are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are always present onsite.  Typical Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are provided for all predicted regulated substances in Appendix A.\n\n\nChemical                       CAS No.\n\nToxic Substances:    \n\nCyclohexylamine                       108-91-8\nEthylenediamine                       107-15-3\nPiperidine                       110-89-4\nToluene 2,4 Diisocyanate (TDI)     584-84-9\nToluene 2,6 Diisocyanate (TDI)      91-08-7\nVinyl Acetate Monomer               108-05-4\n\nFlammable Substances:    \n\nDimethylamine                       124-40-3\nEthylamine                        75-0"

Delta North Channel is a Program 3 level facility.\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, EPA's RMP*Comp&trade; program was used to evaluate off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp&trade; is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the regulated chemicals involves the catastrophic failure of the largest vessel containing the regulated substance at the facility and is either a rail car (est. 20,600 gallons) or a tanker truck (est. 6,000 gallons), depending on the regulated chemical, but for conservatism all worst-case scenarios assume catastrophic failure of a rail car.  The highest temperature recorded in the Houston area from 1889 - 2011 according to the National Climatic Data Center was 108 A?F, so that temperature was used for worst-case scenarios. \n\nThe alternative release scenarios include:\nA?    3\" hose with 1\" puncture while filling at 90A?F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \nA?    3\" hose with 1\" puncture while filling at 70A?F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \nA?    3\" hose separation flange at 90A?F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \nA?    four drums falling off the loading dock and contents leaking within one minute at 100A?F.  \nA?    overfilling of a drum at the filler for 1 minute at 90A?F.  \n\nNone of these scenarios are likely to result in the full amount of the regulated substances being released because of onsite personnel and other mitigation techniqu"
