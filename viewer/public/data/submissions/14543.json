IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE THE RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENFIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nTHIS FACILITY STORES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR THE RETAIL TO FARMERS.  THE PRODUCT IS RECEIVED AND STORED IN STORAGE TANKS AT OUR  FACILITY AND THEN SOLD TO FARMERS FOR DIRECT APPLICATION FOR CROP NUTRIENTS.\n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED IS 84,117 POUNDS STORED IN ONE 18,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 84,117 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .94 MILES.\n\nB.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKLEY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .41 MILES.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\" OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.  OUR FACILITY IS ALSO INSPECTED BY THE STATE OF COLORADO WHICH PERFORMS ANNUAL INSPECTIONS TO ASSURE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR STANDARDS.  WE ARE ALSO GUIDED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\"\n\n5.  THE FIVER YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nTHERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS:\n\nA.  A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.38.\nB.  PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARE TITLE III (EPCRA)\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY.  PREIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS.  AS A RESULT OF OUR RECENT EVALUATIONS WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO REDUCE OUR INVENTORY OF ANNYDROUS AMMONIA AND HAVE REMOVED ONE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK.  WE HAVE ALSO ELIMINATED ONE COMPLETE LOADOUT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF POINTS IN THE TRANSFER OPERATION WHERE ACCIDENTAL RELEASES COULD OCCUR.  NEW SAFETY EQUIPMENT HAS ALSO BEEN INSTALLED.  THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME."
