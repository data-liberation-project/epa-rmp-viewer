Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Haviland's way of doing business.  Haviland has established environmental, health, safety and emergency response policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD), Haviland subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Distribution.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Kalamazoo facility has one process that involves regulated substances.\n\nThe Kalamazoo facility Hydrazine Hydrate 55% unloading process involves unloading and packaging of Hydrazine Hydrate 55%, which is to be used in boiler water treatment applications.  The regulated substance involved with this process is Hydrazine Hydrate 55%.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the catastrophic failure of a 5,000 gallon portable Isotainer and the release of 40,000 lbs. of Hydrazine Hydrate 55%.  The evaporating Hydrazine Hydrate 55% could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThere is not a flammable worst-case scenario for the same catastrophic failure of the 5,000 gallon Isotainer due to the flashpoint of the regulated substance to be >212A?F.\n\nThe toxic alternative case scenario is a ruptured hose during the unloading process, which could result in the release of 4,700 lbs. of the regulated substance to containment.  The evaporating Hydrazine Hydrate 55% could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThere is not a flammable worst-case scenario for the same ruptured hose scenario due to the flashpoint of the regulated substance to be >212A?F.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PR"

In the event of an emergency requiring assistance form the outside, our personnel will make the necessary notifications and will be able to interact effectively with outside emergency response personnel.  Working with Haviland Emergency Response Team members, the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety and Kalamazoo County LEPC would make any decisions concerning how best to protect the neighboring community.\n\nIn the event of a release of our one regulated substance, or other hazardous material, Haviland's Emergency Response Team would use chemical-specific response plans and procedures to address the emergency at the earliest stage possible so as to prevent escalation of the incident.\n\nContracted professional technicians test our fire protection system, which includes signals, alarms and sprinkler protection of all processing areas, on a monthly basis.  \n\nFacility personnel test our safety s"
