Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Agland Co-op in Gaylord, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee, public, and\n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\n\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\n\nresponse efforts with the Gaylord Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\n\nexpertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in two interconnected 30,000-gallon tanks, thirty-seven1,000-gallon nurse tanks and\n\nsix 1,000-1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Gaylord, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The maximum\n\namount stored at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 109,000 gallons (476,776.9 pounds)\n\nincluding the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility\n\ncontains 262,446 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.
