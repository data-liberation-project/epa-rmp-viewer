SPC manufactures and markets prescription pharmaceutical and over-the-counter products.  With some 20,000 employees, the company has manufacturing facilities in over 24 countries and sells products in more than 125 markets worldwide.  In conducting its business, the company is committed to protecting the environment wherever it has operations around the world. We recognize that responsibility for successfully fulfilling its pledge to safeguard the environment rests with every employee, from the chairman on down.\n\nChallenges exist at all levels to find and implement ways to minimize the environmental impact of company operations.  Programs and internal auditing systems have been put in place to ensure that these opportunities are not lost and that the businesses are operated in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  Corporate policy requires that all facilities comply, not merely with governmental regulations, but also with the company's own internal guidelines delineating good environmental practices.  Compliance is ensured through the work of an independent corporate environmental auditing department, which reports directly to top management and whose findings are presented annually to the board of directors.  Internal and external environmental guidelines play a key role in how manufacturing processes are designed and operated and in decisions pertaining to the selection of raw materials.  The day-to-day responsibility for protecting the environment falls to three groups of Schering-Plough employees: the engineers and environmental professionals assigned that function at each facility; the corporate environmental resource group; and the Corporate auditing team.\n\nAt the company's major sites environmental professionals are on staff to monitor closely the research and/or manufacturing processes, including"

They must stay current with all pertinent laws and regulations and alert facility management to impending changes, potential problems and opportunities for improvement.\n\nThe primary function of the corporate environmental resource group is to identify strategic environmental issues and provide guidance and cost-effective strategies to division and corporate management. Working hand-in-hand with the environmental audit team, the resource group reviews reports by the team and suggests ways to solve problems and improve practices and all applicable governmental laws and regulations.\n                                                                                                                                                                             SPPLLC (Schering-Plough Products LLC ? Manati Operations) has established prevention programs in the manufacturing of bulk pharmaceutical active ingredients (antibiotics and steroids) as well as final dosage products.  It is during the manufacture of bulk steroids that two Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulated chemicals (toxic liquids) are used above threshold quantities:  Chloroform & Hydrofluoric Acid.  Chloroform is utilized in the manufacturing of steroids at the plant.  Hydrofluoric acid (70% solution) is stored in containers and its only in the process of storing or receiving this chemical that the threshold value is exceeded as one would add up the contents of all drums.   \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               PREVENTION PROGRAM: SPP, LLC has implemented a prevention program for the covered processes.
