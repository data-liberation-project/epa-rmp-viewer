Natgasoline strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility. Natgasoline also strives to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. The facility has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the process at this facility. One part of these systems is the risk management program which helps manage the risks at the facility and complies with the requirements of the EPA's Rule 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at the facility. \n\n\n\nThis document satisfies the RMP executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and provides the public with a description of the risk management program at Natgasoline.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nNatgasoline's goal at its Program 3 stationary source is accidental release prevention while maintaining emergency response procedures to minimize consequences in the event of any such release. Natgasoline maintains an Emergency Procedures Manual providing necessary information and guidelines to utilize in the event of an emergency situation resulting in accidental release of a regulated substance. Natgasoline's objective is to train employees and contractors in emergency response procedures and requires that emergency response actions are supported by proper consideration for safety, health, and welfare of employees, contractors, the surrounding community, and property.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nNatgasoline has developed a management system to oversee implementation of the RMP elements.

Topics chosen are relevant to respective personnel assigned duties, and general and specific information is provided as informational instruments to enhance employee participation in facility-wide safety performance.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nNatgasoline keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe process operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within Natgasoline are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets. Natgasoline promotes maintaining process parameters within limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nNatgasoline also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance, and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\n\n\n\nNatgasoline will periodically update its PHAs of affected units. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nNatgasoline maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, Natgasoline operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Natgasoline has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nNatgasoline uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Natgasoline has procedures in place to provide that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Natgasoline personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. In addition, Natgasoline evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Natgasoline personnel monitor contractor performance to evaluate the level at which contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nNatgasoline conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nNatgasoline will investigate incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which can include contractors, will document its findings, develop recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to Natgasoline's management for resolution. Corrective actions will be taken in response to the investigation team's findings, and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete.
