Topics chosen are relevant to respective personnel assigned duties, and general and specific information is provided as informational instruments to enhance employee participation in facility-wide safety performance.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nNatgasoline keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe process operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within Natgasoline are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets. Natgasoline promotes maintaining process parameters within limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nNatgasoline also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to enhance safety features in the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\nNatgasoline has a comprehensive PHA program to recognize and control hazards associated with the process.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance, and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\n\nNatgasoline will periodically update its PHAs of affected units. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nNatgasoline maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, Natgasoline operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Natgasoline has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \n\nContractors\n\nNatgasoline uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Natgasoline has procedures in place to provide that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Natgasoline personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. In addition, Natgasoline evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Natgasoline personnel monitor contractor performance to evaluate the level at which contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nNatgasoline conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nNatgasoline will investigate incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which can include contractors, will document its findings, develop recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to Natgasoline's management for resolution. Corrective actions will be taken in response to the investigation team's findings, and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete.

The facility implements other work permits as necessary to assure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance and contract personnel.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nNatgasoline has safe work practices in place to sustain worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to foster that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nAdditional Safety Features\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Natgasoline has many safety features to help prevent the accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. These safety features help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error. These features include but are not limited to: \n\n\u00bf\tOperating parameter monitors with alarms.\n\u00bf\tProcess relief systems.\n\u00bf\tIsolation valves (manual or automated).\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOn August 13, 2021, at approximately 8:00 AM, an uncontained fire caused substantial damage to the syngas turbine, the control system, the installation structure, the building roof,"

      "SummaryText": "and the overhead crane. The fire was initiated by lube oil (Mobil DTE Oil Medium, Turbine Oil) sprayed from a loose LP actuator flange connection onto hot surfaces of the syngas turbine system. These surfaces had temperatures exceeding the oil\u0092s autoignition temperature of 608\u00b0F. Approximately 270 gallons of oil were discharged from the loose LP actuator flange connection during the incident, intensifying the fire. The event lasted approximately 17 minutes and did not result in the release of RMP-classified chemicals; therefore, the event is not included within the \"S6. Five-Year Accident History\" section of this report. (Source: RCA \"CT-02001 - Syngas Turbine Fire - August 2021\")\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nNatgasoline maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program to protect the safety of workers, the public, and the environment. The plan includes procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or a toxic gas release. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plan has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties."
