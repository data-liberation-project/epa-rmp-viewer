      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFoster Turkey Products C Street has prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  Finally, both CalOSHA and OSHA regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling system and practices at the facility.\r\n\r\nMany state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications. Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely event that an ammonia release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team to end the release.\r\n\r\nThe C Street Plant and Distribution Center is located at 500/520 C Street in Turlock, California. The C Street Plant and Distribution Center falls under the NAICS Code of 311615 (Poultry Processing). The regulated chemical used on site is anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7). Foster Farms purchased the facility in 1982 from the Grange Company.  The main"

The C Street Plant and Distribution Center is located on approximately two acres bordered by 5th Street on the east and 6th Street on the west.  The north side is bordered by B Street, and the southern border is D Street.  The areas surrounding the facility consist of residential, industrial, and commercial properties.  Portions of the facility are surrounded by a security fence, prohibiting unauthorized access.  Additionally, the entrance to the facility is staffed by plant security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\r\n\r\nOperations at the facility consist of the storage and distribution of poultry products.  The facility receives poultry products from other Foster Farms facilities, and packages them or sends them to other Foster Farms facilities for further processing.  All processing rooms and cold storage units are cooled by air handling units supplied with ammonia.  The ammonia systems at the C Street Plant and Distribution Center are located in secured rooms, in a fenced area, or on the roofs of the facility.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a closed-looped refrigeration system at the facility.  The ammonia system for the C Street Plant provides cooling for storage areas and freezers. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  Ammonia is used as the heat transfer media in the refrigeration systems.  As the ammonia passes through heat exchangers in the various refrigerated areas or units, heat is transferred to the ammonia thus cooling the air, water, or product that is giving up heat.  The ammonia is then compressed and passes through a condenser where it gives up heat to air and water.  The ammonia cycles back through the heat exchangers to repeat the process.  Anhydrous ammonia is a commonly used industrial refriger"

Foster Farms has had no reportable releases within the past five years.\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations also require a review of the accidental release prevention programs and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.\r\n\r\nThe predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia system is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The major pressure vessels in the ammonia systems at the C Street Plant is equipped with pressure relief valves.\r\n\r\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility include: \r\n\u00bf\temergency shutdown systems\r\n\u00bf\tcomponent specific safety shutdowns\r\n\u00bf\tan ammonia leak detection system is installed in the C Street Plant engine room and other rooms in the facility \r\n\u00bf\tan ammonia leak detection system is installed in the Distribution Center engine room and other rooms in the facility\r\n\u00bf\tcomponent specific safety shutdowns and the ammonia leak detection system alarm locally and to the security department at Foster Farms' headquarters in Livingston, California \r\n\u00bf\tammonia pipes, valves, and components are labeled\r\n\u00bf\tpressure relief valves are replaced at least every five years\r\n\u00bf\tfire alarms and sprinkler systems are installed throughout the plants\r\n\u00bf\tammonia equipment is located in a fenced or secured area\r\n\u00bf\ta computerized preventive maintenance program is used for both systems\r\n\u00bf\tmost oil draining done through an oil still\r\n\u00bf\tself-closing valves are used for dra"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP auditing and inspection program.  Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared and are being reviewed for the ammonia system at the facility.  The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the system.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of equipment.  The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\r\n\r\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.

As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farm continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Foster Farms will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM and related attachments and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Foster Farms' internal review practices and Foster Farms will maintain the most current versions on site. Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM and related documents and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."
