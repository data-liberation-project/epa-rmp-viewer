      "SummaryText": "ime is 28,000 pounds (14 ton containers).\n\nThe Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant provides biological treatment for sanitary and industrial wastewater generated through out the Greater Columbia area.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process to destroy nuisance and pathogenic microorganisms present in the wastewater (i.e., chlorine use as a wastewater disinfectant is an industry standard).  The chlorination process includes chlorine container handling and storage facilities, chlorine feed system (piping, evaporators, vacuum chlorinators, and injectors), and related safety equipment and instrumentation.  Sulfur dioxide is used in the wastewater treatment process to remove residual chlorine from the treated wastewater prior to discharge from the plant (i.e., sulfur dioxide use to dechlorinate treated wastewater is an industry standard).  The dechlorination process includes sulfur dioxide container handling and storage facilities, sulfur dioxide feed system (piping, evaporators, vacuum sulfonators, and injectors), and related safety equipment and instrumentation.  The Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant is manned 24-hours a day and access to the plant site is restricted to authorized personnel.\n\n3.  General accidental release program and the chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant complies with EPA's RMP rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and with all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorination and dechlorination processes were constructed, and are operated, in accordance with recommendations of the WEF, Compressed Gas Association, and Chlorine Institute.  The Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n \tHigh level of training for operators and maintenance personnel\n \tEquipment inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance\n \tUse of industry standard process and safety equipment\n \tUse of accurate and ef"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  Accidental release prevention is a function of the safety devices (technology) inherent in the facility design, safe material handling practices used (procedures), and commitment to training of plant employees (management practices).  All applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Prevention Program (40 CFR 68.65-87) are adhered to.  It is a goal of the Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant to ensure plant and community safety through an aggressive program of hazard analysis, preventive maintenance, equipment testing, standard operating procedures, and employee training.\n\nThe Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant emergency response policy involves the preparation of a emergency preparedness plan which is tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.   The emergency preparedness program includes procedures for notification of the City of Columbia Fire Department HAZMAT Team (off-site mutual aid response), Richland County LEPC (community response plan), and SCDHEC (state response plan).  The Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant emergency preparedness program is based upon recommendation of the Water Environment Federation (WEF), Compressed Gas Association,  and the Chlorine Institute and is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Emergency Response Program (40 CFR 68.90) requirements.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe regulated substances handled and used at the Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The Maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the facility at anytime is 48,000 pounds (24 ton containers).  The Maximum intended inventory of sulfur dioxide at the facility at anyt"

Five-year accident history:\n\nThe Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the past five years.  Due to the effectiveness of the  release prevention program, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine during the past five years.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant has an emergency preparedness plan that is integrated with the LEPC plan.  The Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a mutual aid agreement with the City of Columbia Fire Department HAZMAT Team to provide emergency response services in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  Emergency response drills are conducted with the City of Columbia Fire Department HAZMAT Team on a routine  basis.  The plant emergency preparedness plan includes procedures for the notification of offsite mutual aid responders, LEPC, SCDHEC, and the public along with a discussion of actions to be taken in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  The plan also addresses first aid and medical treatment.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant plans to continue to evaluate the regulated process as required under the PSM/RMP standards to ensure safe operations."
