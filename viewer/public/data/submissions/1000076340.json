RNE is designed to produce approximately 80,000,000 gallons of fuel-grade ethanol per year. Wet and dried distillers grains (WDGS/ DDGS) are byproducts of ethanol production and are sold to local markets as animal feed. Ethanol production activities fall under the SIC code 2869, Industrial Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified.\r\n\r\nRNE is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by RNE's investment in accident prevention, through the establishment of a facility that is well designed, installed, operated and maintained. In addition, training is considered a crucial part of safe operation and accident presentation. Staff is trained about spill prevention and control methods as well as emergency response plans in place at the facility. \r\n\r\nIt is RNE policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. RNE management is dedicated to safety, spill prevention and proper emergency response.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe RNE Ethanol Plant is located near Onida, in Sully County, South Dakota. The facility is located in the northeast quarter lying east of the railroad right-of-way of Section 14, Township 114 North, Range 77. The Ringneck facility encompasses a triangular parcel of property that is approximately 40 acres in size. The site is bounded on the north by 186th Street, on the east by 305th Avenue, and on the west by a railroad.   The area can be classified as rural. \r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The substance which RNE has onsite that are reg"

      "SummaryText": "ulated by the RMP program is Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture. The denaturant (natural gasoline) is used to denature the ethanol so that it is unfit for human consumption before being shipped offsite. Denaturant is generally stored onsite in the denaturant tank.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nFor denaturant the worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 359,114 pounds of flammable mixture, creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from the entire denaturant tank. The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.6 miles from the denaturant tank. Public receptors are also located within the radius. Although RNE has numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\r\n\r\nSince RNE qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were also required due to the program level. The ARS for denaturant is the release of 323,212 pounds of flammable mixture creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the denaturant tank. \r\n  \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nRNE is a new facility and therefore has had no reportable accidents.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY REPSONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nRNE is registered with the Sully County LEPC and does not have its own Emergency Response Plan for emergencies requiring a high level of emergency support. In the case that an incident occurred which required high level emergency response, RNE would call 911 for the necessary fire, medical or other emergency support. \r\n\r\nAs explained above, RNE is committed to worker and public safety and has invested in training and equipment to prevent chemical spills and other emergency situations.

      "SummaryText": "he event of a chemical spill, plant personnel will respond to contain the release, as necessary. Some physical aspects of the plant would also help the personnel contain a potential spill. For example, all tanks that contain denaturant are located in a large, bermed containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would be prevented from migrating off-site, and a fire could be extinguished before it spreads to other units at the facility.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nRNE is subject to RMP Prevention Program Level 3.  RNE is fulfilling its duties to comply with the EPA requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.115(d) through the completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  RNE has complied with Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. \r\n \r\nThe denaturant tank is equipped with tank level sensors and alarms and has a bermed containment structure that surrounds the entire tank farm.  These chemical specific prevention measures minimize the risk for an RMP reportable incident.  Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, RNE is committed to protecting its employees, the greater community and the environment from the release of hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. RNE management is committed to promoting a safe work environment and will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support to operate the ethanol production fac"
