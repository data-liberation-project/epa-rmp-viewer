OUR POLICY ALSO IS TO EVACUATE ANY PEOPLE IN THE AREA AFFECTED AND NOTIFY THE LOCAL AND THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTERS IF THE RELEASE IS MORE THAN 100 LBS.  \n\nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nTHIS FACILITY IS A GRAIN ELEVATOR.  WE DRY AND STORE GRAIN, CUSTOM MILL FEED, SELL DRY FERTILIZER, LIQUID NITROGEN (28-0-0), ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, AG CHEMICALS, AND ALSO CUSTOM APPLY FERTILIZER AND HERBICIDES.  WE USE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR A NITROGEN SOURCE FOR FIELD CORN.  THE AMMONIA PLANT CONSISTS OF TWO STORAGE TANKS - ONE 113,415 LB TANK AND ONE 52,930 LB TANK - AND ASSOCIATED PIPING, VALVES, AND NURSE TANK CONNECTORS ON THE FILL RISERS.

TOTAL ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE ON SITE IS 288,915 LBS.  \n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nOUR WORST CASE SCENARIO IS A FAILURE OF AN EXCESS FLOW VALVE OR BROKEN PIPE CAUSING A SUDDEN RELEASE OF LIQUID AND VAPOR CAUSING A TOXIC PLUME.  ACCORDING TO EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 3.6 MILES WITH A TOTAL POPULATION OF 373 PEOPLE.  \n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\n\nOUR ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS A FAILURE OF A PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE CAUSING A VAPOR CLOUD WITHIN AN ENDPOINT OF 0.5 MILES.\n\n  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.  \n\nTHIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH EPA'S ACCIDENT PREVENTION RULE AND APPLICABLE STATE AND LOCAL CODES AND REGULATIONS.
