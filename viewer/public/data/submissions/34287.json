      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at ATOFINA's Calvert City production facility for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n-Introduction;\n-ATOFINA policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n-Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n-Hazard Assessment;\n-Prevention Program;\n-Five-Year Accident History;\n-Emergency Response Plan; and\n-Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nATOFINA Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\nATOFINA's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill ATOFINA's commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager, the HES Manager, and the Plant Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of ATOFINA's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\nThe ATOFINA Calvert City facility is located at 4444 Industrial Parkway, Calvert City, Kentucky.  The facility manufactures refrigerants by continuous chemical reaction and purification processes and premium plastic resins through a combination of continuous (monomer) and batch (polymeriza"

The substances that are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability are hydrogen fluoride (HF), chlorine, and vinylidene fluoride.  HF and chlorine are used as process reactants.  Vinylidene fluoride is both a product for off-site sale and a reactant in a polymerization process.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios: Mitigation Measures\nThe multiple layers of preventive measures make it very unlikely that a significant release will occur.  In addition, in the unlikely event that a release occurs, ATOFINA has an array of mitigation measures to reduce any potential impacts.  Passive mitigation systems include diking to limit the spread of HF and, consequently, the release impact.\n\nActive mitigation systems cannot be considered in modeling worst-case scenario impacts, but the significant investment that ATOFINA has made in active mitigation measures should effectively reduce the risk associated with an RMP incident.  These include:\n-HF could be pumped from a damaged tank into another storage tank to reduce the amount potentially released.\n-Diking system is provided with an open drain to a trench with a pumping system that can be manually activated to contain and collect spilled HF.\n-HF tanks are under continuous observation to detect any problems, including operator visual inspections (4 to 6 times per day), video camera surveillance, and both local and control room indicators for pressure and tank level/alarm.\n-HF detectors are strategically located to provide early warning of any release.\n-Extensive firewater system in the event of a fire resulting from a vinylidene fluoride release\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios: Mitigation Measures\nWhile the alternative release scenarios are, by definition, more likely than the worst-case scenario, they are still very unlikely given the facility's prevention program."

This prevention program covers those processes that handle HF, chlorine, and flammable substances (including vinylidene fluoride) above the threshold quantity of either the PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n-In-depth process hazards analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the OSHA PSM standards;\n-Written operating procedures (kept up-to-date) are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher traini"

These measures include:\n-Storage tanks are pressure vessels which are designed and constructed in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel standards using industry-standard materials of construction.  Furthermore, design specifications incorporate Zone 3 earthquake standards.\n-As part of the Mechanical Integrity program, pressure vessels and atmospheric storage tanks are inspected and tested according to the American Petroleum Institute Standard 510 and Standard 653, respectively.\n-The risk of overfilling is addressed by high-level and high-high-level alarms.\n-The risk of over-pressure is prevented by a system of pressure relief valves and a vent header.\n-Tanks are generally located in areas wher"

ATOFINA realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.

Chemical exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts as well as regulatory requirements.  At this time, no further major and specific improvements have been identified."
