This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary. We are also coordinated with the City of Tulare Fire Department, Visalia Fire Department's HazMat, and the Tulare County CUPA which provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Saputo - Paige plant is located at 800 East Paige Avenue in Tulare, California 93274. The plant's primary products include cheese and whey powder. The facility employs approximately 425 full-time employees. There is one RMP-regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, used in the plant's refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for processing and cold storage of dairy food products. This system contains 64,390 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Saputo - Paige plant follows the elements of the CalARP Prevention Program 3 as a release prevention program for the RMP. In addition, Saputo Corporate - Department of Refrigeration Services works with the plant confirming regulatory and corporate standards are being followed, providing guidance and standardization on the CalARP program and acting as a resource for the plant on the CalARP, EPA RMP, OSHA PSM and other environmental programs.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSaputo - Paige plant has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.

      "SummaryText": "icies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSaputo - Paige plant developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo's Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Specific employees are trained and certified as first-aid responders. Employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), compliance audits, seismic assessments and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate - Department of Refrigeration Services, Department of Environmental Affairs, Health & Safety and Risk Group will improve compliance and overall plant safety."
