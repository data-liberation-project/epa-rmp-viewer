It is our mission to \"improve the quality of life and share happiness\" using core values of \"service, integrity, quality, and safety.\"  We have a zero-tolerance policy for elements that can be harmful to our mission.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\nAs a poultry processor, a significant amount of refrigeration is required.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used at our facility as a cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  Ammonia is contained in two separate, closed loop systems. It is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels within these two systems.  Ammonia is the only substance at this facility that is covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Allen Harim facility has an Accident Release Prevention Program that complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and the EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n\n\n-Employee Participation Program\n\n-Process Safety Information\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-Operating Procedures\n\n-Training Program\n\n-Contractor Safety Program \n\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\n-Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n-Hot Work Permit Procedures\n\n-Management of Change Procedures\n\n-Incident Investigation Procedures\n\n-Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n-Emergency Response Procedures\n\n-Computerized Equipment Maintenance Database\n\n\n\nWe take several precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from these systems.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and shutdown devices) which are designed to detect unsafe conditions that could cause a failure.  We have a written preventative maintenance program and equipment maintenance database that is designed to maintain and document the on-going integrity of the piping, vessels, and safety "

This program includes procedures for testing, inspection, and maintenance of the system at regularly scheduled intervals according to manufacturer's and industry guidelines and standards.  If any problems are identified, corrective action will be documented.  All new construction is designed and built to industry guidelines and standards in place at the time of implementation.  We have a training program designed to ensure that system operators are qualified to operate and maintain the system, along with emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond to system incidences.  Allen Harim evaluates their mechanical systems, written programs, and training annually and during applicable system changes.  Allen Harim employs external agencies to conduct Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, and Mechanical Integrity inspections in accordance to OSHA and EPA standards.\n\n\n\nAllen Harim maintains an Emergency Response Program at this facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to an ammonia release, or other emergency, and is coordinated with the local fire department.  All Allen Harim employees receive training during their initial orientation that includes evacuation procedures, emergency release notification, and alarm signal recognition.  Allen Harim also maintains an emergency response team.  This team consists of designated employees trained as first responders and refrigeration technicians trained in emergency shutdown procedures for the system.\n\n\n\nWe have a Process Safety Team that is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.  This team meets regularly to communicate and monitor all aspects of the program.\n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia related accidents at the facility over the last five years that resulted in significant onsite or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nWe are continuously monitoring and inspecting the system to identify any potential hazards; revie"
