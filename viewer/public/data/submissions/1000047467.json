This program is fully described in a document entitled EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Food Lion Distribution Center # 3 as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.  \n\n\n\n\n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Food Lion Distribution Center # 3 emergency response procedures, Food Lion Distribution Center # 3 has provided copies of the ERP for review and approval by the local agencies. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nFood Lion Distribution Center # 3 aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.
