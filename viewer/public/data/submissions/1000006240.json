Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCentral California Chemical Corporation (also \"CCC\") stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.  CCC has posted Emergency Response Procedures at the site and in the office, which includes procedures for reporting any hazardous chemical accident or release and the emergency contact telephone numbers.  CCC also has Emergency Medical and First Aid Response Procedures, which is a quick reference for employees and office personnel on what to do if a person is exposed to chlorine gas, as well as Emergency Escape Mask Procedures, which details how to use the emergency escape mask in the event of an accidental  release.  CCC also has an emergency action plan (and Hazardous Material Business Plan) coordinated with the LEPC.\n\nCCC's Emergency Action Plan is contained within its PSM.  Employees will respond only to incidental releases and emergency responders will be called for emergencies.  When filling cylinders with chlorine, employees have available safety goggles, gloves and escape masks.  Employees test the System using ammonia for leak detection prior to filling the system with chlorine from the ton container.  A chlorine leak detector with sensors and a seismic detector are also installed on site for early detection of any chlorine leak.  The alarm will trigger an auto-dialer to emergency contacts, and an emer"

An Emergency Response Program identifies who to call in the event of a release, which includes calling 911.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCCC provides chlorination service to residential swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one-ton containers to twenty pound net capacity service cylinders in accordance with the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.  The twenty pound cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to chlorinate customer swimming pools.  The facility operates five days a week (M-F), eight hours per day, and 49 weeks per year.\n\nThe Fill Yard is used exclusively for the storage and repackaging of chlorine.  The yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of chlorine delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of empty one-ton containers. \n\nThe Fill Yard is not exposed to vehicular traffic.  The Fill Yard houses all of the chlorine containers and is locked after normal working hours. Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the chlorine storage area and signs are posted indicating a restricted area.  Security precautions are taken to prevent access to chlorine storage areas.  Container handling and storage is per local, state and federal regulations.\n\nThe amount of chlorine packaged and stored on site each month is seasonally dependent, so maximum quantities will vary depending upon time of year.  The summer months are the busiest swim times and, consequently, the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period. CCC stores a maximum of 32,000 pounds of chlorine.  This amount includes the contents of 11 one-ton containers, 370 max twenty-pound cylinders, and the (1) one-ton container in the repackaging process.   The Federal threshold of 2,500 pounds is exceeded as the maximum on site at any given"

Administrative procedures (including inventory) are in place to prevent the amount of chlorine from exceeding the stated maximum amount of 32,000 pounds.  \n\nChlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Delivery of one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The one-ton containers, up to a maximum of 12, are stored and/or used in the Fill Yard.\n\nOff-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist or a lift gate.  The one-ton containers are placed on the rails in the Fill Yard.  The one-ton containers are manually rolled to the desired location and chocked to prevent movement.  Empty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are chained or strapped into place in an upright position.  \n\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine in small diameter, short length piping is directed into a liquid caustic absorption scrubber.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.  The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in accordance with the maintenance procedures in the PSM.  \n\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.  The major components of the chlorine system are:  the one-ton DOT approved containers, the proprietary transfer piping assembly, the twenty pound capacity DOT approved cylinders, the scale for weighing the cylinders during the filling operation, and the secondary containment gas cabinet with caustic absorption scrubber.  \n\nA proprietary tube assembly is attached to the lower (liquid level) angle valve on the operating one-ton container and an empty service cylinder is brought into place on a scale and attached to the other end of t"

The caustic solution comprising the absorption medium is prevented from being sucked back into the system using the unique design of the proprietary and confidential chlorine packaging system.  \n\nThe packaging system is operated under pressure from the chlorine container. Operational and test procedures are in place which ensure that the scrubber system is operating correctly.  Chlorine is not vented to the atmosphere.  Full twenty pound cylinders are stored in the packaging area until loaded onto delivery trucks.  Transport and loading of the cylinders adheres to DOT and other regulations.\n\nFilling is done by trained, qualified personnel.  Written filling procedures exist and are followed.  The entire system is evacuated and the one-ton container liquid valve is shut during non-working hours.  Filling personnel have available an escape masks/respirator.

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe emergency response program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of local emergency responders at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  CCC's Emergency Response Plan is located at the fill yard and in the office as a quick reference for how to handle an emergency, and has also been filed with the San Jose Fire Department, and the Santa Clara County Hazardous Materials / Environmental Health Division.  \n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCCC's Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) was recently updated and changes were not implemented on site.
