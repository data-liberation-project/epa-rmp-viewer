Chlorine is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA.) The City of Burnsville is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is important to an accidental release prevention program that includes areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorine storage and feed processes at our facility. It is our policy to comply with applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends on the safe handling procedures that we use combined with the safety devices included in the design of this facility and the training of our personnel.\n\nIf a release of chlorine should occur, we are coordinated with the Burnsville Emergency dispatcher and in turn the Burnsville Fire Department and Emergency Operations Coordinator, who will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of an unforeseen release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Burnsville, MN Water Treatment Plant has one regulated substance, chlorine, at the facility. Chlorine, a toxic gas stored under pressure as a liquid, is used for disinfection of the city\u00bfs water supply. \n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility at any time is six - 2,000 pounds tanks, for a total of 12,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Burnsville MN Water Treatment Plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule requirements as specified in 40 CFR part 68. The Plant is also in compliance with OSHAs Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Rule as specified in 29 CFR 1910.119. The chlorine cylinders are"

      "SummaryText": "handled minimally outside of the facility and are stored indoors. The facility is designed with a chlorine detection system that automatically activates a scrubber system in the event of an indoor release. Additionally, a vacuum demand chlorine delivery system automatically stops the flow of chlorine if a piping or valve failure causes a vacuum loss. Water Treatment Plant operators are competent in the chlorine system operations and are trained in the hazards and operating procedures associated with the chlorine processes.\n\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\nThe Burnsville MN Water Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the history of the facility. There have been no documented releases over the last five years.\n\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\nEmergency Response by the Burnsville Water Treatment Plant employees will be limited to incidental releases only. The plant has coordinated emergency response actions with the City of Burnsville Fire Department and the emergency dispatcher. In the event of a catastrophic event, the City of Burnsville\u00bfs comprehensive Emergency Operation Plan (EOP) may be initiated. The plans are studied, practiced, and updated as needed. Both the Police and Fire/EMS departments are responsible for the EOP.\n\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe City of Oshkosh uses a continual improvement process to improve safety and minimize risks of release.  The process includes periodic review of the RMP, operating procedures, training content and the Hazards Review.  Modifications to these entities are documented as appropriate."
