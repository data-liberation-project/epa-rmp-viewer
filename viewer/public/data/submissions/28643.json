Accident release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThis distribution facility plans to store chlorine and sulfur dioxide shortly after we register this Risk Management Plan with the EPA.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are considered hazardous.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility will be to store chlorine and sulfur dioxide for distribution to our customers which include water treatment facilities and general industry.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide will be received in 150 pound cylinders and 2000 pound containers and will be shipped in the same packages.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The maximum total inventory of chlorine to be stored at this facility is 50,000 pounds.  The maximum total inventory of sulfur dioxide to be stored at this facility will be 30,000 pounds.  Average inventories will be much less.\n\n3.    The worst case scenario and the alternate release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\n\nThe largest vessel (container) stored on-site will have a capacity of 2,000 pounds.  Details of the release scenarios are contained in the RMP data elements and are not repeated here for security reaso"

      "SummaryText": "ns.\n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n5.    Five-year accident history.\n\nThis facility has not stored chemicals subject to RMP registration before this date and therefore has had no accidental releases within the past 5 years.\n\n6.    The emergency response program.\n\nThis facility plans to have its own emergency response program and trained team.  Until we have our own, properly trained team, emergency response will be by public responders, by trained response teams from other, nearby Harcros Chemical facilities, and by other responders trained according to the Chlorine Institute?s Pamphlet 64 (Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities).  We have discussed our Risk Management Program and the response capabilities of the West Point Fire Department with them most recently on June 25, 2003.\n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for storing chlorine and sulfur dioxide at this facility is to minimize risk by reducing the overall travel time from our other distribution facilities to existing customers near this facility.  Harcros Chemicals will continue to participate in the Chlorine Institute and National Association of Chemicals Distributors programs, and continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines."
