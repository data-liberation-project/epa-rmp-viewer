      "SummaryText": "This document was developed for American Crystal Sugar Co. - East Grand Forks Facility (ACSC) in an effort to fulfill criteria of the Risk Management Program (RMP), as required by Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), and regulated by 40 CFR, Part 68.  ACSC is a beet sugar manufacturing plant.  The quantity of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and methane at the facility is greater than the Threshold Quantities (TQ) of 5,000 pounds and 10,000 for the respective chemicals.  This is EPA's criteria for requiring the development and submittal of the information found in this RMP.  A hazard assessment was conducted for the manufacturing process and consideration was also given to the other hazardous chemicals at the plant as well.\n\nSO2 is considered toxic and methane is considered flammable by EPA standards.  The same properties that made SO2 valuable for beet sugar processing, and methane as a fuel supply, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the potential impact or threat to nearby members of the community and/or environment.  Safety depends upon the manner which we handle chemicals; combined with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility; and the training of our personnel.\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is this facility's intent to uphold industry standards int he design, construction and operation of the facility.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency was to occur, we have trained personnel and equipment ready for response in the event of a spill of hazardous materials.  It is also our policy to notify the East Grand Forks Fire Department (via the 911 system), and request that they respond to the emergency if the emergency is behond our capabilities.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLES\n\nSO2 is used at the plant for processing the sugar beets int"

      "SummaryText": "o some of the various products.  SO2 is received and stored in a 13000 gallon pressurized tank.  Inventory of SO2 held at the faciity is a maximum of 118,000 pounds held in the tank along with residual in process piping.  Liquid SO2 passes out of the tank, through process piping, then branches into one of two process endpoints.  Prior to each end use, the SO2 passes through a vaporizer, which transitions it to a gaseous state.  It then flows into the process endpoint.  Approximately 60% of the SO2 is used in the diffuser water supply and the other 40% is used in the sulfitation of \"thin juice\" extract.\n\nMethane is generated by the anaerobic digestion of facility waste water.  As waste water is pumped through the digestion vessel, bacterial consumption of organic material in the water releases a flammable gaseous mixture.  This mixture is composed of approximately 70% methane and the balance being carbon dioxide with traces of hydorgen and nitrogen gas.  The volume of methane in the head space of the digester is calculated to be 18,428 lb.  The methane is used as a fuels ource for the pulp dryer furnaces and excess methane is burned off at a flaring station.\n\nPhysical access to the plant is restricted by chain link fencing and manned security at all entry points.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nRMP standards require that a Worst Case Scenario (WCS) representing all toxics be developed for covered processes.  Following, is the WCS for SO2, representative of its respective hazards.  Similarly, RMP rules require an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for these same chemicals.\n\nWCS for SO2 -- 118,000 lb. is the maximum quantity of SO2 in a single storage vessel that can be released in a WCS.  For WCS, according to RMP*Comp Version 1.06, the distance to toxic endpoint for the WCS is 18 miles.  The facility is located in an urban area with an estimated population of 64,000 persons living within the 11 mile radius.  There are no environmen"

For ARS, according to RMP*Comp Version 1.06, the distance to toxic endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 miles.  There are public receptors within this distance.\n\nWCS Methane -18,428 lb. of methane is released and involved in a vapor cloud explosion.

The distance to 1 psi overpressure is .2 miles using RMP*Comp Version 1.06.  There are public receptors within this distance.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations,  ACSC takes a systematic, proactive approach to evaluating chemical processes.  Using this approach, the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process changes, and other elements that affect the covered processes are all considered.  By conducting thorough evaluations, accidental releases are prevented and the consequences of releases are minimized.\n\nBy fulfilling the required elements of the RMP standards, ACSC intends to prevent releases of hazardous substances and minimize the impacts of accidental releases, especially into locations that could expose employees, the community or the environment to serious hazards.  Our management systems address each of the key features of a successful release prevention program including:\n\n-Maintaining Process Safety Information (PSI):  ACSC maintains up-to-date technical information about safe operating limits of the processes and the associated hazards of the chemicals involved.\n-Conducting Process Hazar"
