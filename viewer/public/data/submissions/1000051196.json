      "SummaryText": "Carlisle Brake & Friction (CBF) operates a manufacturing facility located at 1110 West Tenkiller Road Catoosa, Oklahoma 74015. The plant has on-site an outdoor anhydrous ammonia tank with a volume of 9,200 gallons. CBF limits the actual quantity of ammonia in the tank to 7,820 gallons. Converting to mass, this is 42,300 pounds total onsite storage capacity. The vessel is a 250 psig MAWP rated container.  CBF uses the ammonia in a metal sintering process and/or nitriding process. The ammonia is processed through dissociators to convert the ammonia to nitrogen/hydrogen for use as a reducing atmosphere in sintering furnaces. Ammonia is also used directly in bell-type nitriding furnaces.\n\n\n\nCBF is included in the Rogers County Local Emergency Planning Committee's (LEPC) emergency response program. CBF has its own emergency action plans in place for internal response considerations. The LEPC's emergency response program contains provisions for the use of a vast network of resources, communications and logistics, response management hierarchy and training and drills for possible third party responders. \n\n\n\nCBF internal emergency response procedures include the evaluation of any ammonia leak from the tank, or associated piping/equipment/components. After evaluation of the leak and if necessary, personnel will be evacuated from the facility in a safe and organized manner, away from direction of the ammonia cloud. Any leak from the ammonia tank or associated piping that results in a likely possibility of the cloud leaving CBF property, procedures are in place for the immediate notification of the local emergency services and the LEPC. CBF complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management, Hazard Communication and other safety standards. \n\n\n\n"
