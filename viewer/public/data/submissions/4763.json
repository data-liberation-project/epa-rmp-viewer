The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make is necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\tOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institure's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of any potential affected neighbors.\n\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\tBermco Aluminum is a secondary aluminum smelter that uses chlorine for demagging operations.    Chlorine is received by truck.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.   The regulate substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is 30,000 pounds.\n\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario\n\n\tWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) is 4.30 miles.  This has the potential to extend past the facility's boundary.\n\n\tAlternative"

This has the potential to extend past the facility's boundary.\n\n4.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\n\tThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute.  Routine maintenance and component checks will still be performed weekly to insure safety and  performance of this system.\n\n5. \tFive-year accident history\n\n\tThere has been no accidental release of chloride within the  past five years.\n\n6. \tThe emergency response program\n\n\tThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  We have discussed this program with the Birmingham/Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the City Fire Department.  In the event of a fire or leak in the chlorine system area:\n\n\t1.\tAlert the main office, plant, fire department, police department, and all local emergency response agencies and teams.\n\n\t2.\tAlert all employees and check all departments for fire, injuries or unsafe conditions.\n\n\t3.\tAvoid inhalation of fumes or vapors released.\n\n\t4.\tSupervisors and foremen to keep employees orderly and guided out of harms way.\n\n\t5.\tLarry Johnson or Don Powell will give direction and assistance to employees.  They will answer questions from local authorities and assist in any effort to control or manage the catastrophe.\n\n\t6.\tFire extinguishers are located in all departments to put out small fires.\n\n\t7.\tIf an evacuation of the plant is deemed necessary, employees will be escorted to the front parking lot for assembly, kept together and there await further instruction.\n\n\t8.\tCare should be t"
