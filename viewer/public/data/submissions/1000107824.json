      "SummaryText": "1. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nThe Linde Gas & Equipment - Hahnville (Taft) located in Hahnville, Louisiana complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Linde Gas & Equipment Inc. (LG&E) is committed to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner and being responsible member of the community by making safety information available to the community. Safety is a top priority at LG&E as reflected in its proactive planning, state-of-the art equipment, employee training and its coordination with external agency to prevent accidental releases from occurring and instituting controls to rapidly mitigate a potential release if it does occur.\n \n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe Linde Gas & Equipment \u0096 Hahnville manufactures, handles and/or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Acetylene and Ethylene is stored in quantities exceeding the applicable threshold quantities, as established by the EPA. The primary source of acetylene gas at the Hahnville facility is by pipeline from a nearby chemical plant.  The acetylene is a byproduct of a chemical production process.  If necessary, the Hahnville facility also has the capability to generate acetylene by reacting calcium carbide and water. The acetylene gas is compressed into specially designed acetylene cylinders on a flatbed trailer. The cylinders contain a flammable solvent, dimethylformamide, into which the acetylene is dissolved. These acetylene trailers are then transported as a unit to our customers throughout the country. The processes involving Acetylene and Ethylene are cylinder filling and distribution.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program:\nIn accordance with OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management standard and EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program rule, the Linde Gas & Equipment - Hahnvil"

This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n - Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity.\n- Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive design safety and management of change programs that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review.\nLinde has an employee participation program that promotes involvement in the process safety program and helps ensure understanding of facility-specific elements of the safety program.\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered processes at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\nThe acetylene filing area is equipped with a deluge system which can be operated manually or passively. The facility also employs plant emergency trip station so that in the event of an emergency all plant processes will be halted.\n\n4. Five-year accident history:\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents at the LG&E Hahnville facility during the previous five years. \n\n5. Emergency Response Program:\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the"
