Founded in 1962, the joint venture's first production facility was a nitrogen fertilizer complex.  In 1964, Nipro, Inc., (the predecessor of today's DSM Chemicals) was organized to manufacture caprolactam, a monomer of nylon used in nylon fiber production.  Subsequent expansions of DSM Chemicals resulted in two additional caprolactam plants in Augusta, in 1974 and 1976, which made DSM Chemicals the largest independent supplier of caprolactam in the U.S.  In 1999 nylon 6 production began at the DSM Augusta site.  In 2007 recycling of nylon carpet to produce caprolactam began at the DSM Augusta site. \n\n \n\nWHAT DOES DSM Chemicals MEAN TO AUGUSTA? TO GEORGIA?\n\nThe DSM Chemicals plant facilities and sales offices in Augusta mean jobs for approximately 350 persons, with a payroll in excess of $25 million and total sales of approximately $700 million, of which approximately 40% are export.  DCNA is actively involved with the local community participating in numerous programs, and just to list a few:  Adopt-a-School program sponsor for two area schools, Adopt-a-Road program, community blood drives, pacesetter status as a supporter of the United Way for the C.S.R.A., River Road Community Advisory Panel, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and routinely conduct an open house for local community members.\n\n  \n\nWhat is Caprolactam?\n\nCaprolactam is the primary raw material used in the production of nylon 6.

Molten caprolactam is shipped to domestic customers, who convert it to nylon 6 for end uses including carpet, tire cord, monofilament (weed eater line and fishing line), engineered plastics, and apparel.  DSM also converts caprolactam to a solid-state flake.  The flake is then packaged for export sales mainly for textile applications (apparel and hosiery).\n\n\n\nOleum\n\nBasic Information\n\nA?Oleum, also known as fuming sulfuric acid, is basically a clear liquid with a slight milky-gray tint and a severely irritating odor.  Exposure to the liquid causes tissue destruction. Oleum is a severe fume hazard.  The fumes are sulfur trioxide, are severely irritating and concentrations over 3 ppm are harmful. \n\nA?Oleum is used as a sulfating agent, dehydrating agent, in dyes, in explosives, and in petroleum refining.  At DSM it is used to convert our intermediate product to our final product, caprolactam.  After it is neutralized with ammonia, the oleum is in turn converted to ammonium sulfate, a by-product fertilizer.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History \n\nThere were no reportable releases of oleum in the last five years.  We have had four accidental releases of oleum in the past five years totaling 52 pounds.  The largest release was 25 pounds.  There were no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, and there were no offsite effects from these releases.  \n\n\n\nChemical Specific Accidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nA?Oleum tank fumes are vented to a scrubber that recovers the fumes.\n\nA?Oleum tanks and pumps are diked to limit spills and the downwind impact of the above scenarios.\n\nA?Oleum is piped to our plant from the nearby supplier, thus, eliminating the risk of spills while unloading from tanker trucks.\n\nA?A spare storage tank is maintained.\n\n \n\nAmmonia\n\nBasic Information\n\nA?Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very strong pungent odor, that is supplied to DSM as a liquid at high pressure and low temperature "

The vapor is extremely irritating and concentrations over 200 ppm are harmful. \n\nA?Ammonia is one of the most commonly used chemicals in the United States for a variety of industrial, commercial and agricultural purposes. DSM uses it as a refrigerant and as a raw material to produce aqua ammonia and hydroxylamine.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History\n\nWe have had 25 accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years. The largest release was 980 pounds.  There were no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, and there were no offsite effects from these releases.\n\n \n\nChemical Specific Accidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nA?Ammonia inventory was minimized by the removal of an ammonia tank.  Inventory is limited to the contents of piping from our supplier, PCS Nitrogen, located close to our plant.\n\nA?A piping inspection program is utilized to monitor the condition of ammonia piping and repairs are made as determined by these inspections.\n\n \n\nAqua Ammonia\n\nBasic Information\n\nA?Aqua ammonia is also known as ammonia water, ammonium hydroxide and household ammonia in very dilute solution.  Aqua ammonia is a colorless liquid with a strong characteristic odor.  Concentrations of solution range up to 30% ammonia in water. Like ammonia, aqua ammonia is very irritating to mucous membranes, eyes and skin.  The vapor is extremely irritating and concentrations over 200 ppm are harmful. \n\nA?Aqua ammonia is used for a variety of industrial, commercial, agricultural, pharmaceutical and household purposes.  DSM uses it to neutralize oleum and produce a by-product fertilizer, ammonium sulfate.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History\n\nWe have had 3 accidental releases of aqua ammonia in the past five years.

Natural gas is delivered with a strong odorizer to give it a distinctive smell.  Methane can be a simple asphyxiant by displacing oxygen from the atmosphere; otherwise, no acute or long term health effects are known.  Natural gas can also exist in a liquid state at cryogenic temperatures of -260 degrees F.  In the liquid form it is colorless and non-flammable; however, the cold vapors are visible at the liquid surface and will ignite.  Skin contact with liquid natural gas may cause cryogenic burns or frostbite; tissue damage may result from inhalation of super cooled vapors. \n\nA?Methane is primarily used as a fuel.  At DSM, it is used in the gaseous state as a fuel and as a raw material to produce hydrogen, an intermediate product.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History\n\nThere were no spills or releases of methane during the last five years .\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Accidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nLNG storage tank has been taken out of service, emptied and purged.

Cyclohexane is very flammable in air even in small volumes.  The flammable vapors are heavier than air and tend to accumulate on the ground rather than disperse.  Cyclohexane is not a listed chemical subject to EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation; however, it is considered the most serious hazard in the DSM plant.\n\nA?Cyclohexane is used in the manufacture of nylon, as a solvent and as a paint and varnish remover.  DSM uses it as a raw material to produce caprolactam.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History\n\nWe have had 48 accidental rele"
