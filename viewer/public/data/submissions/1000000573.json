      "SummaryText": "JBS Packerland, Inc. in Tolleson, AZ is a Beef processing facility that includes harvesting, rendering, and processing of Beef. This facility normally operates using three (3) separate suction pressures. The first suction pressure is referred to as the Low-Stage at +0 psig (-28 deg. F), used for: Box Loadout; Storage; Freezer; Offal; and Old Hot Box. The second suction pressure is referred to at 32 psig (+28 deg. F) used for: New Ralph's Loadout; Box Cooler; WC-1; New Fab; Breakup; Sales Cooler; New Hot Box; Old Fab; and WC-2. The third is for the MUA units in use over the Harvest Floor. This system operates at 42 psig (+28 deg F). The MUA system is the newest fefrigeration system and was installed in 2002. Provisions were made, as a backup, allowing the low stage system to be operated as high stage equipment by tying it to the 32 psig system. Industrial ammonia systems are constructed with a receiver that contains the supply of liquid ammonia necessary to operate the system when needed upon demand. Liquid ammonia is pumped from an accumulator that pushes liquid to the evaporator units located throughout the facility. At control valve stations there is a pressure reduction device, known as an expansion valve, going to the evaporators. As it passes through the valve, the pressure and temperature of the ammonia refrigerant is lowered and passed through the evaporator tube bundle where it picks up heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor. The lower pressure ammonia vapor is drawn form the evaporator tube bundle back to the accumulatror via a suction line.\n\nVapor from the accumulator is fed to the compressors. During the compression phase in the compressors, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased. The high pressure ammonia vapor then flows from the compressors to the evaporative condensers where the heat is removed. The vapor condenses into a high pressure liquid and is collected into the high pressure"
