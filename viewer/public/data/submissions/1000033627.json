Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures, and training.  Keyera has developed a comprehensive propane accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Bernalillo County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We also maintain incipient stage fire fighting equipment on site. This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  The facility came online in 2000 and is annually inspected for compliance by the New Mexico State LP Bureau.\n\n\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled: \n\nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to retail propane dealers.  The facility consists of three 30,000-gallon tanks holding approximately 110,000 pounds each of liquid propane.  There is also the capacity for four 30,000-gallon rail cars.  There are both manual and automatic emergency shutdown systems on all LPG equipment at the site.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one of the 30,000-gallon storage tanks or the connecting piping when each of the storage tanks are filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. It assumes all the propane is released and ignited.  No passive mitigation system is considered.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite to 0.4 miles, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Keyera has multiple safeguards in place which make this scenario very unlikely.  Our alternative release scenario invo"

      "SummaryText": "lves a propane release from a multi-port 2.5 inch relief valve over a 5-minute period at a rate of 863 pounds per minute.  An excess flow check valve is the active mitigation system considered in this scenario.  A total of 1,512 pounds of propane is ignited, resulting is a vapor cloud explosion.  This would generate a pressure wave with a minimum 1 psi overpressure extending 0.1 miles.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite.  The only  public receptors within the distance to the endpoint is the industrial park.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history: \n\nKeyera Energy, Inc. acquired the facility in June 2006.  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place.  To the best of our knowledge no such incident occurred prior to acquisition by Keyera Energy, Inc.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Bernalillo County Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency.  We also have trained employees in incipient stage fire fighting.  We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department have been provided the opportunity to visit our facility and inspect our propane storage system.  \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nKeyera Energy, Inc. will continually strive for safety improvement.  Periodic process safety inspections will be conducted followed with timely response."
