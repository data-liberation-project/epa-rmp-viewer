We consider this a high priority and we continue to reduce the risks associated with working with hazardous substances wherever feasible.  Management supports the development and implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and is committed to maintaining safe practices to preserve a safe environment for our employees and our community.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the RMP, Off Site Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the accident history at this site, Flex Foam is eligble for the RMP Program Level 1.\r\n\r\nSafety is primarily promoted by improving and continuing education for employees, by minimizing handling of hazardous substances, by restricting employee and more so public access to areas where hazardous substances are used and stored, by enhancing process, building, and grounds monitoring, and by pollution prevention efforts wherever feasible.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATLED SUBSTANCE HANDLING\r\nFlex Foam manufacturers polyurethane slabstock foam (slab) and rebonded foam products.  Both foam products are used for carpet pad, and slab foam is also used in the upholstery, furniture, and bedding industries for cushion and padding.  Pads and cushions are cut to order on site as specified by the customer.\r\n\r\nSlab foam are synthetic foams derived from the chemical reaction of a diisocyanate and alcohol in water, aided by catalysts and sometimes a blowing agent.  Colors and/or fire retardants are added as required by the customer.  Flex Foam uses toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in this process.  This is the only hazardous substance on site subject to RMP requirements.\r\n\r\nChemicals are pumped and metered from the main storage tanks to a mixhead where the reaction takes place.  All chemicals are liquid and this part of the process is automated and totally enclosed.  System operation is continuously mon"

These are implemented whenever feasible.  This program is reviewed and updated annually.  Flex Foam has successfully participated in this program for several years and has received commendation for some of the reductions realized.  In particular, Flex Foam reduced the emissions of hazardous air pollutants significantly by reducing the use of hazrdous substances, and are no longer subject to the Clean Air Act Title V permitting program.  \r\n\r\nSafety issues are reinforced throughout the week during the daily crew meetings.  Safety meeitngs are held periodically.  Safety is further enhanced by restricting access to the chemicals and the chemical use areas to a small number of employees and plant management.  These individuals receive additional training.  There is only one TDI tank on site.  It is located in a  tank room located in a central processing building.  The tank room in which the TDI tank is located is restricted to very few operating personnel and plant management.  This room is temperature controlled and monitored daily.  Public access is restricted to front offices and the loading docks which are located on the west side of the property, not near the manufacturing buildings.  \r\n\r\nSystem preventive maintenance and daily system inspection help minimize accidental occurrences by looking for potential failures.  The grounds and buildings are also monitored by a 24 hour Security System which includes video monitoring, intrusion and fire alarms with security notification, and automatic dispatch capabilities.  \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nFlex Foam has not had any incident within the last five years that hs resulted in an accident in accordance with 40 CFR 66.42.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP), in accordance with Arizona Revised Statutes 26-347 (ARS), is maintained with the"

Since handling and processing of TDI is contained within our buildings, the Program provides for select and trained personnel to indentify, notify, and initially isolate an incident, while the remaining employees are to evacuate.  Absorptant material and PPE are kept in close proximity of the TDI tank room for isolation and small spill clean up purposes.  Large spill clean up is contracted.  Operating personnel with access to the restricted chemical storage and processing areas carry two way radios and cell phones with them at all times.  Alarms are used to notify personnel to evacuate.\r\n\r\nThe ERP is reviewed annually.  Training and drills are conducted periodically.\r\n\r\nNotification procedures are in accordance with EPA and ARS requirements.\r\n\r\nFlex Foam Management has directed Plant Management to continue to review our processess and activities and provide safety improvements wherever feasible."

      "SummaryText": "itored.  The reaction is practically instantaneous, within seconds the product begins to 'set up.  The resulting foam bun is conveyed through a tunnel and away from the mixhead.  Almost all the TDI is consumed in the product, very little is emitted from this process.\r\n\r\nRebonded foam products are recycled slab foam which is ground into small chunks and mixed with binder.  The binder is a blend of TDI or MDI, polyol, and oil and is like glue in consistency.  The resultilng mass is pressed into a round mold and steam is injected for curing (setting).  Flex Foam can recycle up to 80,000 pounds of scrap foam in a single shift of operation.  Most of the scrap foam is old foam from demolition or remodeling projects and would have been sent to landfills.  Scrap foam from on site processing activities area also recycled in the rebonded foam process.\r\n\r\nThe final products are cut to  on site in accordance with the customers' orders.\r\n\r\nVolatility of TDI is very low.  In addition, when it is combined with the polyol (as it is in both processes), it its even more bound up and less volatile.  Therefore, the evaporative losses are low and fugitive air emissions from these operations or in the event of a spill, are minimal.\r\n\r\nGENERAL AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\nIn addition to the passive mitigation measures mentioned above, Flex Foam has taken several measures to reduce not only employee exposure to hazardous substances, but also to reduce the likelyhood of accidental spills or releases.  \r\n\r\nBoth the rebonded and slab foam chemical processes have been automated, enclosed, and are closed systems.  The systems are monitored closely during operation at the control board and flowmeters.  The systems are also walked down before and after operation.  The equipment and tank levels are inspected daily.  Chemical deliveries are closely monitored by delivery personnel and a Flex Foam Operator and the delivery supply connection is adjacent to the tank room.  \r\n\r\nFlex Foam"
