The location also has an Emergency Response Program in place that includes:\r\n-\tThe mill has a first aid department staffed by nurses with daylight coverage 7 days a week and someone on call during off hours, a HazMat team, a first aid squad, and a firefighter team specifically including structural firefighting all on site;\r\n-\tParticipation in the Local Emergency Planning Committee; \r\n-\tProcedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases;\r\n-\tDocumentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure;\r\n-\tProcedures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\r\n-\tProcedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance;\r\n-\tTraining of all employees in relevant procedures; and\r\n-\tProcedures to review and update the emergency action plan as appropriate.\r\nEnsuring safe operations will continue to be a foremost priority for WestRock.  In that regard and as part of Process Safety Management, Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each covered process.  The most recent Process Hazard Analyses for chlorine and chlorine dioxide have been completed with all action items completed or in progress.  WestRock's safety programs are audited internally on a periodic basis and modified or upgraded as needed to help ensure positive risk elimination and prevention."
