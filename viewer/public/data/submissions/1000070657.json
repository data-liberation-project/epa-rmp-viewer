A forest products company with offices and operations around the world, WestRock's distinctive products manufactured for customers around the globe include paper, packaging, and envelopes. \n\nWestRock's presence in Virginia began in 1899 when the company launched operation of its papermaking facility in Alleghany County.  The company was known as Westvaco until a merger with Mead in 2001 at which time it was called MeadWestvaco.  In July 2015, MeadWestvaco Corporation, entered a business combination with Rock-Tenn Company.  As the result of this business combination, MeadWestvaco Corporation became WestRock Virginia Corporation.  \n\nSince then, WestRock has invested extensively in its Alleghany Highlands operations.  Today, nearly 1,000 men and women work at WestRock's Alleghany Highlands manufacturing operations.\n\nA commitment to excellence in all aspects of its operations defines WestRock.  The company's paper mill in Covington, VA is recognized worldwide for its technological sophistication and production of premium coated bleached paperboard.  Paperboard from the Covington mill is used for a variety of consumer packaging and printing applications including packaging cartons, food service, books and greeting cards.\n\nWestRock also sets the highest standards for workplace safety.  The company and its employees have worked consistently to build a strong and solid system of work practices and procedures to prevent accidents from happening.  WestRock remains committed to maintaining the integrity of a workplace safety program that is among the industry's best.  \n\nWestRock's Paperboard Operations in Covington, VA has two substances that fall under the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The regulated substances handled at the source in excess of their applicable threshold qualities are chlorine dioxide (CAS No. 10049-04-4) and chlorine (CAS No. 7782-5"

The purpose of this regulation and WestRock's PSM program is to prevent accidental releases and to minimize the consequence if one should occur.  The location also has an Emergency Response Program in place that includes:\n\n-    The mill has a first aid department staffed by nurses with daylight coverage 7 days a week and someone on call during off hours, a HazMat team, a first aid squad, and a firefighter team specifically including structural firefighting all on site;\n\n-    Participation in the Local Emergency Planning Committee; \n\n-    Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases;\n\n-    Documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure;\n\n-    Procedures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\n\n-    Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance;\n\n-    Training of all employees in relevant procedures; and\n\n-    Procedures to review and update the emergency action plan as appropriate.\n\nEnsuring safe operations will continue to be a foremost priority for WestRock.
