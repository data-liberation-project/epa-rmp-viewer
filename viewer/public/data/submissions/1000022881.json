We are committed to operating and maintaining our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As members of the National Association of Chemical Distributors we adhere to the principals of Responsible Distribution.  In addition, to ensure our employees have the best training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant is primarily involved in manufacturing sodium glucoheptonate and blending chemical formulations used by the carpet industry.  As part of this manufacturing process, we use two substances that are covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  However, we also use a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nHarcros is planning to start a new process in 2011 which uses ethylene, a flammable chemical subject to the RMP regulations.  Harcros is taking all the necessary steps to assure the safe handling of this material also.\n  \nThe Harcros Chemicals - Dalton plant is located on a 27 acre site.  The covered chemicals in use are anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia and ethylene.  These processes are subject to Program Level 3.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

The documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees.  They address important process parameters such as operating limits for equipment, design basis and configuration of equipment, and physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used.\n\nChemical information is contained in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's).  Important process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents may include (1) operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrumentation diagrams, and (7) other information that is important for understanding the design intent, operating limits, and hazards of each process.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant has a program for ensuring hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled.  A hazard and operability study (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses.  We update and revalidate each hazard analysis every five years or whenever a significant change is made.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented, and recommendations are tracked until resolved.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOur employees develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of the facility.  These procedures cover (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup of a new or improved process.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure they are updated following process changes.\n\nThis plant uses a batchsheet system.

They include process deviation codes describing the actions to take under various conditions (e.g. high temperature or pressure, loss of cooling).\n\nTRAINING\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant trains all workers to safely and efficiently perform their tasks.  Employees new to a process are provided basic training including (1) overview of process, (2) properties of substances used and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of the process, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\n\nRefresher training intervals are decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training is documented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger employees, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify damage or deterioration before equipment fails.  When a problem is found, maintenance personnel correct the problem and try to identify the root causes to help prevent future problems.  Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards for our facility.  The mechanical integrity system includes (1) inspection and testing procedures, (2) replacement equipment specifications, (3) procedures for safe work practices, (4) maintenance personnel training, and (5) required documentation.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nWe review all changes to our processes to determine if new hazards are introduced or existing prevention measured are threatened.  Except for replacements-in-kind, all changes are subject to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced, ("

This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared for service before startup.  This review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves as a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nEmployees at the Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant promptly investigate each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, serious injuries to employees, the public, or the environment.  These investigations identify the facts and root causes of the incident, and provide recommendations to help prevent a reoccurrence.  Recommended corrective actions are tracked until they are resolved.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nHarcros Chemicals encourages employees to be involved in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees participate in process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and management of change hazard analyses.  Employees have access to all information developed as part of this prevention program and are informed of any changes in process areas.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant has safe work practices that ensure the safety or our employees.  These include (1) hot work permit procedures designed to control spark of flame producing activities, (2) confined space entry permits and procedures, and (3) lockout/tagout procedures for isolating energy sources during maintenance.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant occasionally uses contractors for maintenance and construction.

We provide training to contractors to ensure they perform work in a safe manner, are aware of the hazards of the process, understand the emergency response procedures, and report hazards they discover during their work.  We periodically monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nA compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure prevention activities are adequate and safety issues are addressed effectively.  Audits are performed by personnel knowledgeable in the processes but is independent of the facility.  The results of the audit are documented and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant has safety features built into the design of the facility that help to ensure safe operations for our employees, the public and the environment.  These features may contain or control a release, detect a release, or reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility:\nAutomatic detection of vapors with alarms\nProcedures requiring employee be present during loading and unloading operations\nRelease containment and control\nIsolation valves\nManual shutdown systems\nDiked areas to control a release\nPressure relief valves to prevent catastrophic rupture of equipment\nWater spray (deluge) equipment\nPersonal protective equipment (e.g. protective clothing, respirators)\nSpill clean-up equipment.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the last 5 years, we have had one accident that meets the criteria for reporting in this section.\n\nIn 2007, a release of about 150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia resulted in the precautionary and temporary evacuation of about 60 people"
