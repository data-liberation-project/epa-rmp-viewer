      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nWILLOW SPRINGS PROCESSING STATION RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Willow Springs Processing Station (WSPS) has a strong commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Reliant Energy Field Services (REFS) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nREFS operates the WSPS located in Gregg County, Texas.  The WSPS is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant designed for the extraction of liquefied petroleum gas from a gas stream.  The cryogenic extraction plant recovers propane, butanes, pentanes, and hexanes plus from the inlet gas.   Mixed liquids product from the liquids extraction plant is stored in a pressurized storage tank prior to being shipped off-site in tanker trucks.  \n\nThe WSPS consists of a mechanical refrigeration unit, a propane compressor engine, and a glycol dehydration unit.  Additional support equipment includes a 550-gallon glycol storage tank, a 300-gallon mixing tank for glycol and water, two (2) water and antifreeze storage tanks, a 734-gallon lube oil tank, and a 30,000-gallon pressurized liquefied petroleum gas tank.\n\nNatural gas enters the station at approximately 820 psi and ambient temperature.  The gas is cooled by a mechanical refrigeration system employing propane as the refrigerant.  The gas stream is chilled by direct heat exchange with the propane at a temperature sufficient to cause the condensable hydrocarbons and water vapor to condense to a liquid state so that separation from the gas stream can be accomplished.  Energy for the mechanical refrigeration is provided by an engine driven vapor compression unit using the natural gas"

Removal of the water vapor which would freeze at the lowered operating temperature is accomplished by the injection of ethylene glycol.\n\nCondensed hydrocarbons are separated from the glycol and stabilized with heat addition to acceptable storage conditions in a cold feed stabilizer tower, which uses the regenerated ethylene glycol as the heat source.  The extracted hydrocarbons are stored in a pressurized tank with no emissions to the atmosphere.  The glycol is regenerated by using a direct, fired heater to drive off the water and is then re-injected into the inlet gas stream.  Emissions from the glycol regenerator vent are routed to a blowcase and then stored in an underground storage tank that is owned and operated by another company.\n\nThe WSPS was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purpose of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nREFS identified one flammable liquid mixture (liquefied petroleum gas) and zero regulated toxic substances along with the largest vessel quantity stored.  It was determined that a single vessel of the flammable liquid mixture exceeded the threshold quantity.  The identification of this exceedance indicates that WSPS is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis. \n\nThe WSPS previously filed as a Program One facility by limiting the amount of propane on site.  However, because of production demands, the volume of propane stored on site will be increase to 24,000 gallons (102,000 pound).  This additional volume increases the worse case "

WCSs are assumed to occur at ground level with meteorological conditions defined as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.0 meters per second (2.2 miles per hour), and an ambient air temperature of 25?C (77?F).  Topography for WCSs is distinguished between rural and urban.\n\nFlammable Substance\n\nRegulated flammable substances or mixtures containing flammable substances include both gases and volatile liquids.  The WCS assumes that the total quantity of a vapor cloud is released and detonates.  The endpoint for a WCS involving a regulated flammable substance or mixture is an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  For a regulated flammable substance, consequence distance determination is based on its heat of combustion.  For regulated flammable mixtures, the component with the highest heat of combustion can be used for consequence distance determination or, if preferred, directly calculated using equation C-1 of the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCAGD).  The quantity of a regulated substance/mixture used to determine distance to endpoint is the largest quantity of a regulated substance/mixture in a single vessel.\n\nThe flammable liquid mixture evaluated at the WSPS is a mixture of propane, butanes, pentanes, and hexanes contained in a pressurized storage vessel in liquid form.

Therefore, the total amount of flammable liquid mixture stored is 24,000 gallons (102,000 pounds).  Using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule, this mixture represents the facility's WCS for flammables.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for the worse-case release of the flammable liquid mixture was calculated and determined to be 0.38 miles.  Numerous apartments and houses are located within this area with a population of approximately 848 persons.  Therefore, WSPS has filed as a Program 2 facility.\n\nToxic Liquids and Gases\n\nToxic gases include all regulated toxic substances that are gases at ambient temperature (temperature 25?C, 77?F), even if they are stored as liquids under pressure or refrigeration.  For the consequence analysis, a gaseous release of the total quantity is assumed to occur in 10 minutes, regardless of storage conditions.  For toxic liquids, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed to be spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface.  For toxic liquids carried in pipelines, the quantity that might be released from the pipeline is assumed to form a pool.  Passive mitigation systems may be taken into account in consequence analysis for both toxic gases and liquids.  The endpoint for air dispersion modeling to estimate the consequence distance for a release of a toxic and liquid is presented for each regulated toxic gas and liquid in Appendix B of the OCAGD in Exhibits B-1 and B-2, respectively.\n\nThe WSPS does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Analysis of one worst-case release scenario for all regulated toxic substances is, therefore, not required.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAn ARS describes an incident that is more likely to occur than those cited for a WCS.

For ARSs, both active and passive mitigation systems can be considered.\n\nWSPS Alternative Release Scenario for Regulated Flammables\n\n    A single ARS for the LPG process is required under the ARP Program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified as follows: Seal failure on the transfer pump used to load the flammable mixture (LPG) into trucks causes a release from a one-inch opening at a pressure of 125 psig and a temperature of 100?F.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes.  The flammable mixture will vaporize and may ignite a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1-psi overpressure.\n    \n    It was determined that a 10-minute release would involve 1156 pounds of the flammable mixture (LPG).  Using the trinitrotoluene (TNT) equivalency formula from the OCAGD, it was determined that a release of this amount of gas would result in an ARS endpoint distance of 0.08 miles.  There are no offsite receptors within this ARS distance.\n\nWSPS Alternate Release Scenario for Regulated Toxics\n\nThe WSPS does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of each regulated toxic substance is not required.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWSPS has not had any accidental releases during the past five years which meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\nSince the facility is unmanned, REFS has not implemented a site-specific emergency response plan.  The WSPS has coordinated its emergency response activities with local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).  Although Reliant does not maintain a site-specific emergency response plan, Reliant has prepared an emergency response plan for pipeline operations in accordance with USDOT requirements that "
