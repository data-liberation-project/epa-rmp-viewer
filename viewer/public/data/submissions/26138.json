This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Spectrum Field Services plant is located one mile west of Velma Oklahoma, on old highway 7 and operates a variety of process to produce the following petroleum products:\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n2. Regulated flammable products;\na. Propane   \nb. Butane\nc. Ethane\nd. Methane\ne. Pentane\nf. IsoPentane\ng. IsoButane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substance(s) at Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 212,655 pound of flammable mixture contained in three vessels.  The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since the facility is located in a populated area, the WCS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such release and to manage their consequence, Passive Mitigation measures include an Automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and actuate valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergence flare.  This complete process will take at minimum 5 seconds.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable subs"

The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since the facility is located in a populated area, the WCS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such release and to manage their consequence, Passive Mitigation measures include an Automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and actuate valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergence flare.  This complete process will take at minimum 5 seconds.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substance at Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of a flammable mixture from closed drain piping (48,627 pound release in 15 minutes).
