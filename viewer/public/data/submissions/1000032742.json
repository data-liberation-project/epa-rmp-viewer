The Savanna Street Wastewater Treatment Plant treats municipal wastewater from Hinds, Madison, and Rankin Counties, which is chlorinated and dechlorinated in the gaseous form prior to discharge into the Pearl River.  \n\n\n\nThe facility site has 64,000 pounds of chlorine and 32,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide stored at any given time, in 1-ton cylinders.\n\n\n\nUnited Water Environmental Services has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Savanna Plant located in Jackson, MS. United Water's executive management team has committed to full implementation of RMP/PSM programs to prevent the release of highly hazardous substances.\n\n\n\nThere have been no chlorine or sulfur dioxide incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to RMP and OSHA PSM for chlorine and sulfur dioxide. \n\nA PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\n\n\no Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\n\n\no Chlorine and sulfur dioxide safety information as required by the regulations\n\n\n\no Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine and sulfur dioxide management\n\n\n\no Chlorine and sulfur dioxide system maintenance procedures \n\n\n\no Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\n\n\no Conducting Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes\n\n\n\no Developing an Emergency Response Plan \n\n\n\no Training in support of the certification of operators\n\n          \n\nThe Operations Manager and Operations personnel annually"

The vacuum process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.  \n\n\n\no Plant inventories are being maintained to a maximum of 32 ton containers of chlorine and 16 tons of sulfur dioxide at the site.\n\n\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. The services of a Hazmat Team to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Response Drills are being periodically conducted.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. United Water Environmental Services has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\n\n\nAt the Wastewater Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n\n\n-Personal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\n-Lockout/Tagout\n\n\n\n-Confined Space\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n"
