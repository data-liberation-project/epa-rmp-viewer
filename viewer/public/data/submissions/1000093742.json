      "SummaryText": "The Airgas facility in Atlanta, Georgia is owned and operated by Airgas USA, LLC. The facility is a chemical distribution plant which stores, sells and repackages industrial gases.\n\n\n\nLPG (propane and propylene) are brought into the facility via bulk transport tractor trailers.  The product is transfilled into a stationary bulk tank on site.  Individual DOT specification cylinders are filled from the product in the bulk tanks.  The individual cylinders are stored in separate processes, segregated by fire walls.  Each cylinder is filled by weight.  The cylinders are shipped to other Airgas locations on pallets via our internal trucking fleet.\n\n\n\nIn the last five years, there have been no accidental accidental release associated with flammable gases. Accidental release prevention and emergency response procedures for the stationary source include emergency stop technology, safe operating procedures and a trained workforce.   \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program includes emergency shutdown of the system via use of air actuated valves or electrical shut off for the pumps.  The emergency shut off process is also facilitated by a fusible link in the form on tubing that connects the air actuated valves to the emergency stop switches.  At high temperatures, the tubing will melt, releasing nitrogen that will automatically close the valves.\n\n\n\nAt this time, there are no specific planned changes intended to improve the safety of the propylene fill/storage process. All flammable gases are managed using process separation to the extent possible.\n\n\n\n"
