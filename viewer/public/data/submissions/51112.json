The facility maintains a Freezer, Cooler & Dry storage area of nearly 5.5 million cubic ft. which is used to store perishable products. Freezer storage areas at the facility operate at -15\u00b0F to +70\u00b0F.  The facility has approximately twelve truck loading and unloading spots and seven railcar spots as well as an additional six railcar siding to aid in the transportation of products.  In order to maintain desired temperatures, a mechanical refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant is employed.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nFACILITY CONSTRUCTION: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with various Mechanical and Building Codes in effect at the time of construction.  These codes and guidelines outline requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nSAFETY FEATURES:  The ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Safeties include, but are not limited to, pressure relief valves, stop valves, ammonia detectors, a computerized refrigeration monitoring and control system, as well as trained and experienced operators.  Much of the safety associated with the system, is also inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP, 40 CFR Part 68). \n\nMANAGEMENT\u00bfS COMMITMENT TO SAFETY:  Management takes safety very seriously and mandates that the facility maintain a safe working environment for employees, visitors, neighbors, and products at all times.
