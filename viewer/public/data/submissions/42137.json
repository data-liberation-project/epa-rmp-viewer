West Liberty Foods, LLC operates the Facility.  Protein Processors, LLC owns the Facility's building and equipment.  Iowa Turkey Growers Cooperative owns West Liberty Foods, LLC and Protein Processors, LLC.  We use anhydrous ammonia in our mechanical refrigeration system. We have safety and maintenance programs to prevent accidental anhydrous ammonia releases. We coordinate our emergency plans with Henry County Emergency Management and the Mount Pleasant Fire Department through discussions and onsite tours.  Alternative and worst-case release scenarios have been completed for anhydrous ammonia.  Contact us if you would like to review or discuss these scenarios.  No accidents that are reportable under the EPA?s Risk Management regulation (40 CFR 68.42) have occurred in the last five years.  We are continuously reviewing and upgrading our safety, health, and environmental programs."
