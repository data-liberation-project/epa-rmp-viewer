BOX 305\nANSLEY, NE  68814\n\n\nFor further information contact:  Lyle Lovitt, Plant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nThe Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Trotter Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire and rescue department and ECPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\nFacility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application of fertilizer for crop production.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 135,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 135,000 pounds, which represents the volume of our storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario would be a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoints is .41 miles.\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been previously inspected several times by the State Fire Marshall and the deficiencies have been corrected and reinspected.  The local fire department and rescue members have toured the facility and have become familiar with the location of values and the hazard and safety of the system.\n\nManagement and key employees have attended NH3 safety school and other employees are trained as to the hazards, safety, and how to the plant should be operated.\n\n\nThe Five-year Accident History"
