This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0    RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nConsolidated Catfish Producer?s Delta Pride Catfish, Inc. ? Main Plant (Delta Pride) has anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system.  The ammonia stored on site requires protection as defined under the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Threshold Quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  Delta Pride has implemented a PSM program to provide employee information regarding the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals. Delta Pride has also implemented this RMP.  This submittal is the five year update as required by 40 CFR 68.190(b)(1).\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Response Program to ensure the safety of its employees, the community, and the environment. This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency.   All of these components make the Emergency Action Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response. The emergency response policies at the Delta Pride facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\nIn accordance with the 2004 amendment to the RMP regulations, the off-site consequence analyses (OCA) are not included in this executive summary.\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System (the System) for Delta Pride utilizes anhydrous ammonia to function as the heat transfer medium.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only highly haz"

      "SummaryText": "ardous chemical above the RMP threshold quantity on-site.  The System contains nine high stage compressors and eight low stage compressors. The System utilizes liquid ammonia injection for oil cooling on twelve of the compressors.  The remaining five compressors use water-cooled oil coolers.\n\nThe System contains nine evaporative condensers to convert the high pressure ammonia gas into high pressure liquid.  After the high pressure ammonia gas is condensed, it is transferred to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe System, which maintains a maximum inventory of 19,700 pounds (lbs) of anhydrous ammonia, includes three high stage recirculators which provide high temperature liquid ammonia to various evaporator units in the facility.  The System also includes three low stage recirculators which provide low temperature liquid ammonia to other evaporator units throughout the facility.  \n\nAmmonia vapor is removed from the low temperature recirculators to the suction of the low stage compressors.  The discharge from the low stage compressors goes to the high stage recirculators, which provide ammonia vapor to the suction of the high stage compressors.  The discharge from the high stage compressors provides high temperature ammonia gas to evaporative condensers. \n\n3.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nDelta Pride has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system. At Delta Pride, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program. EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3. Thus, Delta Pride ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\n4.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no reportable release as defined by 40 CFR 68.42(a) from Delta Pride in the last five years. \n\n5.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Delta Pride facility has"

The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel. For all emergencies, Emergency Services Coordinator, has operating authority for emergency response at the site of release and assumes control of the incident scene beyond the first responder awareness level.\n\nThis document contains specific information regarding: contact numbers; emergency communication; incident team job descriptions; evacuation zones; emergency evacuation procedures; notification procedures; training; emergency shutdown procedures; personnel roles and lines of authority; emergency recognition and prevention; safe distances and places of refuge; site security and control; medical/first aid treatment; emergency alerting and response procedures; PPE and emergency equipment; and standard operating procedures in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n6.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOperating procedures and PSM training have been revised since the previous RMP submittal.  \n"
