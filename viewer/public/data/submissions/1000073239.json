This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe Whiting Terminal & Storage is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline and propane storage/loading facility.  The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\r\n\r\nThe Whiting Terminal & Storage has two pipelines that are routed through the facility and are regulated by the Department of Transportation.  These two pipelines are a mixed product line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane) and a dedicated propane pipeline.  The facility receives propane from either pipeline (primarily from the dedicated propane pipeline) into a propane storage tank.  This tank is used for distribution to the truck transport loading docks which also have the capability to stench the propane with ethyl mercaptan for retail sales companies.\r\n\r\nAll of the propane and ethyl mercaptan storage tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed a maximum 80% of full capacity.  \r\n\r\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequenc"

This material is routed from the tank to the truck transport loading docks for wholesale shipmnet to propane retailers.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of ethyl mercaptan is used for propane odorization at the truck transport docks, but the maximum quantity on site is less than the threshold quantity for reporting the RMP registration.  \r\n\r\n\r\n Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Enterprise Whiting Terminal & Storage.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 3), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is also required by the facility EPA RMP Program 3 registration.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\r\n\r\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (SDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nAs part of En"
