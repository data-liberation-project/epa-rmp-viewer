The Mill produces more than 240,000 tons annually of premium papers for publishing, advertising, graphic arts, and business office uses, and employs approximately 607 people.\n\nProtecting the health and safety of its employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment is a top priority at Finch. Finch has long maintained, and has regularly reviewed and updated, a comprehensive process safety program to evaluate and reduce any risks associated with the use of chemicals in its manufacturing process. A key element of this program is the commitment to safe and proper handling of chemicals. Controls have been implemented to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, mitigation steps are taken to stop, control, contain and clean up the releases.\n\nThe Mill has four processes associated with regulated substances as defined under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions:\n\u0095\tPulp Preparation \u0096 including nine, one-ton (2,000 pounds) cylinders that store chlorine gas liquified by pressure, with a maximum of three containers attached at any given time to a system of connected piping, evaporators, and eductors,  \n\u0095\tWastewater Treatment \u0096 including ten, one-ton (2,000 pounds) cylinders that store chlorine gas liquified by refrigeration, with one container attached at any given time to a system of connected piping, evaporators, and injection equipment,\n\u0095\tPulp Mill - Anhydrous Ammonia Handling \u0096 including piping and railcar transport of up to approximately 2,000,000 pounds of ammonia gas liquified by pressure, used in the preparation of ammonium bisulfite for the pulping process and to aid in absorption of sulfur dioxide (SO2) produced in the recovery combustion process, and\n\u0095\tPulp Mill - ClO2 Bleaching \u0096 including two 80,000-gallon storage ta"

The Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nThe Finch risk management program helps manage the risk involved with using hazardous substances at the Mill and complies with the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (U.S. EPA\u0092s) 40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program. This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the Risk Management Program and provide the public with a description of the Finch RMP.\n\nRMP regulations require the Mill to compile and maintain safety information related to the regulated substances subject to the Rule. Required safety information includes a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) with information on the substance\u0092s physical and chemical characteristics, physical hazards, health hazards, exposure limits, and precautions for safe handling.  \n\nThe Mill maintains additional technical documentation, including an emergency preparedness plan, to help ensure that employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with the Mill. The documents address:\n\u0095\tPhysical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the Mill,\n\u0095\tOperating parameters for Mill equipment, and \n\u0095\tDesign basis and configuration information for Mill equipment.\nIn addition to maintaining required safety documentation, the Mill has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used on-site.

In the pulp mill, small quantities of ammonia are fed into process streams for consumption. In the power house, ammonia is mixed with a large quantity of water where it becomes diluted. If a release occurs in the ammonia piping or hose, the excess flow valve in the railcar will reduce, if not stop, the flow into the atmosphere.  In addition, the ammonia unloading area is constantly monitored in the control room by video cameras set up outside, so that operator can quickly respond to a release through remotely operated block valves.\n\nCHLORINE\nChlorine is supplied in one-ton cylinders that are approved by both the Department of Transportation and the Chlorine Institute. Chlorine is fed through a short length of tubing into process piping.  In the pulp preparation area, the chlorine flows into large streams of process water, where it is mixed and diluted. In the wastewater treatment area, the chlorine flows into a large stream of wastewater, where it is mixed and diluted. Treatment of wastewater with chlorine is performed only occasionally. In both locations, the chlorine is stored and used inside buildings that are equipped with a scrubber capable of absorbing the contents of a full cylinder of chlorine.  In addition, the Mill has installed permanently mounted chlorine sensors at both locations to alert operators of even small chlorine leaks.\n\nCHLORINE DIOXIDE\nClO2 is produced at the Mill in a ClO2 generator. As soon as it is generated, ClO2 is dissolved in water for storage and use in the bleaching process. Only a minor amount of pure ClO2 exists, as almost all of the ClO2 at the Mill is maintained in the solution storage tanks. The tanks are located inside a containment dike that can hold the entire contents of one of the tanks. The tanks are inspected regularly for any sign of deterioration, such as corrosion.

A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of each Mill process. The team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with PHA experience. The team systematically reviews the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the covered process areas and prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommended actions. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to area personnel, and when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.

For Mill processes involving regulated substances, major hazards identified include a toxic release, over-pressurization, corrosion, overfilling, contamination, and equipment failure.  \n\nAs safeguards, the Mill utilizes process controls including the use of relief and check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, alarms, and rupture disks. Mitigation systems in use at the Mill include emergency scrubbers, enclosures (pulp preparation and wastewater treatment), and a secondary containment dike (surrounding ClO2 storage tanks). In addition, monitoring and detection systems are located throughout the Mill for employees to identify any hazardous releases.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSES\nAn OCA investigates the potential adverse impacts of hazardous material release scenarios. The impacts and analysis results depend on the characteristics of the hazardous material, specifics of the facility layout and process operations, and the physical area surrounding the facility, such as the location of the nearby residential population and environmental receptors.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require the Mill to perform an OCA to determine the maximum distance to toxic endpoint for each regulated toxic substance in exceedance of its associated Threshold Quantity. For Program Level 3 processes, the OCA must evaluate an overall worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario for each regulated substance for inclusion in the RMP. To simplify the analysis and establish comparable standards, the U.S. EPA has provided guidance materials for regulated sources describing how to conduct the analysis.

This distance is assumed to be the point where the toxic substance no longer presents a risk of serious injuries from short-term exposures, based on the substance release occurring over a short period of time under worst-case meteorological conditions. As the worst-case scenario is very unlikely, the OCA guidance also requires an alternative release scenario (for each regulated substance) to be examined.  The alternative release scenarios are based on more likely accidental release situations that would result in the toxic substance reaching an off-site endpoint.  The distances to toxic endpoints from the Mill were determined using the OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations. The methodologies follow the guidelines and use the associated equations for each specific type of release.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Analysis\nThe selected worst-case release scenario considers two 80,000-gallon storage tanks of an aqueous solution with a ClO2 concentration of 0.95% by weight that are both completely full prior to any accidental release. As the storage tanks are isolated and separate, the OCA worst-case evaluation only includes the possibility of a catastrophic event damaging a single vessel. The tanks are cylindrical, fully-insulated, and unpressurized vessels. The tanks are located outdoors, approximately 90 feet from ambient air along the Hudson River. The tanks are housed within a secondary containment dike that is capable of holding 110% of the total amount contained within a tank.  \n\nFor the worst-case release scenario, it is not required to consider the possible reasons for, or probability of, the release of the regulated substance. The worst-case release scenario simply occurs, and when using the U.S. EPA OCA lookup tables, the release characterization incorporates several required assumptions into the analysis:\n\u0095\tThe total quantity of the vessel is spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface,\n\u0095\tThe total quantity spilled occurs instantaneou"

Although the toxic substance will continue to evaporate from a spill pool after ten minutes, the rate of evaporation will be significantly lower and can be safely ignored in the estimation of consequence distance. For the worst-case scenario, the solution is assumed to be dense and the location is classified as urban based on the significant presence of obstructions and variable terrain near the Mill . Based on the assumptions, the worst-case release scenario would result in a greatest distance to toxic endpoint of 14 miles.  \n\nThe greatest distance to toxic endpoint was used to determine the related offsite impacts on public facilities such as businesses, special public facilities such as schools or recreational areas, and residences, as well as environmental locations, such as national or state parks, forests, or wildlife preserves.

The Mill averages 35 to 45 tons per day of ammonia to the power plant through an approximately 1,140 feet line of 1.5-inch pipe, with a flow rate of approximately 62.5 pounds per minute. The alternative release scenario assumes ammonia would be released for a 30-minute period before a Mill employee could safely stop the leak, for a total release of 1,875 pounds. In reality, such a release would be unlikely, as an accidental release would be identified by sensors located along the pipe, at the unloading station, and at the power house that would activate safety devices that would reduce, if not stop, the flow of ammonia. These safety mechanisms were disregarded for this scenario, however, in order to meet U.S. EPA requirements that the release extend off-site. \n\nUnlike the worst-case release scenario, there is flexibility in selection of alternative case scenarios to allow examination of climatological data or recommended values for conditions likely to be applicable to many sites. The analysis followed Guidance recommendations for the following alternative scenario assumptions:\n\u0095\tThe release occurs at ground level, \n\u0095\tThe total quantity spilled occurs instantaneously, either to a depth of one centimeter in a non-diked area or to cover the full area of a diked area, and\n\u0095\tThe release occurs under class D atmospheric stability (neutral), a wind speed of 3.0 m/s, ambient temperature of 77\u00b0F, and 50 percent relative humidity.\n\nThe greatest distance for a regulated toxic substance from the alternative scenario"

For the ammonia alternative scenario, the solution is assumed to be dense and have the same urban land use classification as in the worst-case scenario. Based on the assumptions, the alternative release of ammonia scenario would result in a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles, reaching slightly beyond the Mill property boundary.  \n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint was used to determine the related offsite impacts on public and environmental receptors. Public receptors (residences and the Hudson River) are located within the distance to toxic endpoint. No environmental receptors are predicted to be located within the distance to the toxic endpoint. There is no residential population within the alternative release scenario for ammonia distance to toxic endpoint radius based on 2021 vintage ACS census data available from MCDC.\n\nAlternative Scenario Analysis \u0096 Chlorine\nThe selected alternative release scenario for chlorine assumes the full release of a single chlorine storage tank in the Chlorine Storage Building. The chlorine storage tanks are independent, so that a complete failure would result in 2,000 pounds of chlorine being released within the building. For releases of toxic gases in an enclosed space, such as a building, the release to outside air may be lessened considerably (U.S. EPA, 2009b), and OCA guidance recommends assuming the vessel failure occurs over a ten-minute period.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines a catastrophic release as a release \u0093that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment\u0094. \n\nThe Mill investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment to ensure that similar future incidents can be prevented. The Mill trains its employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. In the event of an incident, an investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented. \n\nThe RMP Rule requires incident investigations and associated reports to include:\n\u0095\tDate, time, and location of the incident,\n\u0095\tDescription of the incident,\n\u0095\tThe amount of release and duration of the incident,\n\u0095\tConsequences of the incident,\n\u0095\tEmergency response actions,\n\u0095\tFactors contributing to the incident, and \n\u0095\tRoot cause analysis.\n\nThe Mill will maintain summaries of any incident investigation and the resulting recommendations for corrective actions for five years and include the incident information in the five-year accident history of the RMP.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION (\u00a7 68.83)\nThe Mill has developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to ensure that the safety concerns of Mill employees are adequately addressed. The Mill encourages active participation of all personnel in the prevention program activities associated with all Mill processes. Employees are consulted on, and informed"

      "SummaryText": "about, all aspects of the Mill\u0092s accidental release prevention program.\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT (\u00a7 68.85)\nThe Mill has established a hot work permit program to control activities to control spark-producing or flame-producing activities that may result in a fire or explosion in covered processes. The Mill has reviewed OSHA fire prevention and protection requirements and has developed a hot work permit form to comply with these requirements. Mill personnel who are to perform hot work are required to complete the form. The appropriate supervisor then reviews the completed form prior to commencing hot work. Training in the use of the hot work permit form is included in the Mill\u0092s safe work practices orientation.\n\nCONTRACTORS (\u00a7 68.87)\nThe Mill has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities are performed in a safe manner. The program reviews the safety record of all candidate contractors to help ensure that the Mill only hires contractors who can safely perform the requested tasks. The Mill explains to contract supervisors the hazards of each process on which they and their employees will work, Mill safe work practices, and Mill emergency response procedures. The contractor is required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who will work at the Mill prior to the worker commencing work. Additionally, the Mill periodically reviews contractors\u0092 training documents and work performance history to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE (\u00a7 68.95)\nThe Mill has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. Communication with team members and contractors occurs on formal and informal levels to ensure complete understanding of the required actions in the event of an emergency. The written plan includes procedures for:\n\u0095\tInforming the Warren County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) about accidental releases that could"
