An alarm system is enabled for all other times when no refrigeration personnel are on site.  There are security personnel on site during these off times.  They call one of three or four maintenance staff for equipment faults.  Equipment faults are monitered via a central computer system tied into the equipment's critical data.  (Temperatures, pressures, level) are some of the data that is monitored.  Automatic shut off valves are in place and will actuate upon a major fault in the system.  Pressure relief valves are installed on all necessary equipment.  Mechanical Integrity guidelines and procedures are implemented and followed.  All other aspects of the PSM program are implemented and followed.",

These Regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In complying this way, we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. Ready Crisp?s program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence of, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage. \n\n\n\nReady Crisp?s safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. \n\n\n\nReady Crisp?s safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and best practices that govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary. All information is communicated to employees of Ready Crisp through training and documentation.\n\n\n\nReady Crisp is a processing and packaging company that utilizes approximately 12,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility?s production and shipping area?s.\n\n\n\nIn a Wo"

The release would travel up to 1.0 miles before no longer posing a significant hazard to the public. However, this scenario is highly unlikely for the following reasons: \n\n\n\nWorst case weather conditions are uncommon?\n\nThe vessel is in a protected area clear of vehicular and pedestrian traffic?\n\nIndustry standards for the construction and quality control of pressure vessels?\n\nSafety relief values preventing over-pressurization of the vessel are in use.\n\nBach-up rupture disks are also in place..\n\nAccident prevention programs in place?\n\nMechanical integrity program, inspection and testing procedures are in place.\n\nEmergency alerting alarms integrated into the process system?\n\nEmergency response and action plans in place at the facility?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an alternative case scenario, mechanical pump seal deterioration under pressure could release approximately 3,830 pounds of ammonia over a ten-minute period before no longer posing a significant threat or hazard. The vapor could travel as far as .30 miles. Mechanical deterioration of an ammonia pump seal was chosen as an alternative release because of its higher likelihood that it could occur. This scenario even though potentially possible, is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency shut-down procedures?\n\nRegular maintenance seal and valve upgrade?\n\nInspection and rounds made daily of the process system to ensure safe operation?\n\nEmergency response plan and refrigeration personnel on-site around the clock?\n\n\n\n\n\nReady Crisp?s accidental release prevention programs are based on safe work practices as referenced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, American National Safety Standards, and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration  (2 ? 1992).
