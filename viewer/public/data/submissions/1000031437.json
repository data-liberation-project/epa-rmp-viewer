This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation and maintenance of our processes.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the stationary source and regulated substances.  The Kinder Morgan, Snyder Gas Plant, located near Snyder, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from pipeline gas and liquid.  The Snyder Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, butane, and propane in concentrations greater than 1% in the natural gas.  Propane is also held in storage for refrigeration processes.  The Snyder Gas Plant also uses or processes chlorine, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfuric acid, however, these substances do not exceed the threshold quantities.  \r\n\r\nHazard assessment results.  The worst case scenario associated with a release of flammable material is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest process containing natural gas.  The total amount of natural gas released would be 245,034 lbs.  The maximum distance to the 1- psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.5 miles.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\nGeneral accident release prevention program/chemical specific prevention steps. The Kinder Morgan Snyder Gas Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Kinder Morgan also provides a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes and chemical handling instructions.\r\n\r\nFive year accident history.  The Kinder Morgan Snyder Gas Plant has had an excellent record of accident prevention over the last five years.  There have been no deaths or injur"

      "SummaryText": "ies reported on or offsite since June 21, 1994.\r\n\r\nWe investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring.  \r\n\r\nEmergency response program, Kinder Morgan works very closely with the local emergency response authorities to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The overall emergency response program at the Snyder Gas Plant is coordinated with the Snyder Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The coordination includes periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials.  The Snyder Gas Plant has 24/7 communication with the appropriate LEPC official and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an accident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety.  Kinder Morgan resolves all findings from incidents occurring at the plants.  If incidents occur, Kinder Morgan will evaluate all possible methods to reduce or eliminate the risk of any occurring in the future.  This could involve decreasing process chemicals inventories, changing operational procedures, and newly revising detection systems, adding or modifying equipment, or increasing training requirements."
