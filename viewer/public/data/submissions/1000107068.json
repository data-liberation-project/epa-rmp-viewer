DT Midstream is committed to\nthe same quality of safety and environmental excellence that all other DT assets promote. This\nphilosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own\nsafety as well as that of the community around them. As a company we follow a close adherence\nto all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\nThe Pelican Treating Plant is a natural gas treating facility that extracts CO2 from natural gas.\nThe treating plant receives large volumes of natural gas and stores any liquids in storage tanks.\nThe treated natural gas is transported via pipeline for sale to wholesale markets. The facility also consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the plant. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present. As such, the Pelican Treating Plant is classified as a Program 1 RMP facility.\n\nEmployees who enter the Pelican Treating Plant complete a thorough training which enables\nthem to address emergency issues as they arise. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies. The plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plan"

DT has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police, Sheriff's Office, or similar). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, DT conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for plant personnel.\n\nDT's management is committed to the following:\n1. Preventing accidents;\n2. Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n3. Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n4. Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with DT\nMidstream operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents.\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide updated information about our\noperations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency\nresponse plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our\nplanned changes to improve safety at the facility. Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."
