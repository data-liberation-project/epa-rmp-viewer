To demonstrate these values substantial resources have been invested into the refinery in accident prevention.  It is our policy to include accident prevention in every part of our business, design, operations, and maintenance systems.  However, if a release should occur, substantial resources (trained response personnel and equipment) will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lemont Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammable products, such as propane and butane.  In addition, the refinery uses Hydrogen Fluoride to produce consumer hydrocarbon products.  In the past, Lemont Refinery used Anhydrous Ammonia but currently a 19% Aqueous Ammonia solution is being used in an effort to reduce the possible hazardous effects of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5 - Year Accident History\n\nWhile minor releases of regulated chemicals have occurred, in the last 5 years no release was large enough to have an offsite impact. The CITGO Lemont Refinery has had one reportable incident in the last 5 years, due to employee/contractor injury.   \n\nOn Monday, October 2, 2006, while in the process of clearing piping to and from a pump (during the turnaround of the refineryA?s alkylation unit), operators opened suction and discharge valves to the pump in order to allow liquid and vapor to flow to the pump-out.  A seal flush pipe had been disconnected from the pump and a flow path to atmosphere was created without the pipe being blocked in.  The release lasted for 1 minute and approximately 186 lbs of a HF Alkylation Recycle Isobutane stream (mixture"

After the incident, there were 5 other contract employees who received medical treatment off site.  CITGO Lemont Refinery could not confirm that any of these contractors suffered actual injury or that the medical treatment was other than precautionary.  We could also not confirm whether these alleged injuries were the result of HF exposure.
