The executive summary identifies hazards associated with operation of Loveland Products, Inc.-Billings (LPI-Billings) and describes practices in place to mitigate those hazards.  This information is available to local emergency response groups.  It is also available to the public in limited form.  This document also provides for control of other information required to be submitted in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThis document should be reviewed for required changes whenever the RMPlan is updated.\n\n\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nDepartment of Labor (OSHA), 29 CFR part 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, February 24, 1992\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule, 40 CFR part 68, Final Rule, June 20, 1996\n\n\n\nPROCEDURE:  How Coverage was Determined for Loveland Products Inc.- Billings\n\nDimethylamine is listed in the RMP rule and is stored above the threshold quantity at Loveland Products, Inc.-Billings.  EPA's RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description and Use of RMP Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nLoveland Products, Inc.-Billings (LPI-Billings) is located in Section 26, Township 1 North, Range 26 East in Yellowstone County, Montana and encompasses approximately 27 acres.  LPI-Billings is a subdivision of Crop Protection Services (CPS).  LPI-Billings operates a herbicide formulation facility which blends and reacts raw technical active herbicide ingredients with alcohols, solvents, amines or water to produce finished products.\n\n\n\nDimethylamine (DMA) is used to produce herbicides through the amination of technically active herbicide ingredients.  The DMA amination process consists of a 60% aqueous solution of DMA along with a bulk active solid in a batch "

Although controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The maximum distance to the worst-case flammable endpoint is 0.40 miles.\n\nThe real life preventative measures which are not considered in the WCS evaluation are:\n\n?    Diked containment area sloping toward an overflow containment that has capacity for entire DMA   storage vessel content;\n\n?    Excess flow valve to prevent breach on piping connecting to the bottom of the pressure vessel;      \n\n?    Pressure Vessel Designed for full vacuum & maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP)of 90 psi;\n\n?    Blanketing valve to control Vessel's pressure at 5 in.H20; PSV set at 35 psig (38% of MAWP);\n\n?    HH (high high) interlock on level gauge and DP gauge;\n\n?     H (high) interlock on level gauge and Dp gauge. \n\n?    DOT pressurized tank car specified for DMA transportation and handling \n\n?     Nitrogen purge preventing DMA vapor release to atmosphere and eliminating static air in the tank car\n\n?     Maintenance and inspection programs to monitor equipment integrity\n\n?

The largest potential loss of DMA would occur during a transfer which would be discovered and addressed within 10 minutes of the transfer startup.  Based off of the actual gpm transfer of 60% DMA over a 10 minute timeframe, the calculated amount of DMA that would potentially be released is 433 lbs. The maximum distance to the flamable endpoint is 0.2 miles.  Accident prevention measures in-place to minimize a DMA release include:\n\n?    Process has failclose valves before and after DMA pump and one at the blend vessel\n\n?     Operators montor flow through automation system for quick response to process deviations\n\n?    Maintenance and inspection programs to monitor equipment integrity \n\n?     In-house operating and startup procedures include operator walking the lines at startup\n\n?    Operators are trained on emergency operations and process deviations\n\n\n\nAlthough these measures are in place and the likelihood of this ARS happening is low, LPI-Billings personnel selected this scenario to be the most probable to occur.  \n\n \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at LPI-Billings.  Processes regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements applicable to RMP and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The administrative procedures used for process safety management have been revised to incorporate all RMP required items and these procedures are now considered PSM/RMP administrative procedures.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nLPI-Billings encourages employees to participate in plant safety.

Implementation of recommendations in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA Team.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios are assigned the highest risk ranking and thus receive immediate attention.  All approved recommendations being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  Upon completion of all recommendations for a specific PHA, a final report is issued that all affected employees can access, thus having knowledge that all the recommendations for the PHA have been resolved.  To insure process safety at LPI-Billings, each process is required to have a PHA revalidation every five years. \n\n\n\nAdditional detail, including responsibilities, can be found in the Process Hazard Analysis procedure (PSM-ADM-04).\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nLPI-Billings maintains written operating procedures for normal operations and emergency procedures.
