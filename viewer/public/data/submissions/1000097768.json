Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program - Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program - Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP/PSM/CalARP Program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Zero Grocery has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP/PSM/CalARP related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Zero Grocery, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Zero Grocery has updated/developed their unified RMP/PSM/CalARP Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which has the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name             | Process Chemical             | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration      Anhydrous Ammonia              20,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP/PSM/CalARP Program promotes overall plant, worker, public, and environmental safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(3) Cold Storage Rooms\n\n(1) Hallway\n\n(1) Loading Dock\n\n(2) Production Rooms\n\n(1) Water Chiller\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\n\n\nZero Grocery is located at 1810 Academy Ave. Sanger, CA 93657. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.690350, -119.552927. The facility is located approximately 3 miles south of state highway 180 in an industrial area surrounded primarily by businesses.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\n\n\n\nZero Grocery is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Zero Grocery has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated areas are either equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation or they are supplied from a recirculator as required for pumped overfeed operation.\n\n\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above the machinery room."

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.

Nevertheless, Zero Grocery continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP/PSM/CalARP Program. This has improved Zero Grocery's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors.

When a RMP/PSM/CalARP Program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Zero Grocery has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP/PSM/CalARP Program"
