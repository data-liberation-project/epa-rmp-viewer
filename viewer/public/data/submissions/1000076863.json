The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 8249 Highway 21 in Mott, North Dakota (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There are two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility with maximum capacities of approximately 18,000 gallons and 12,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into nurse tanks ranging in  from 1,000 to 3,000 gallons.  A maximum total of ten nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia are stored at the facility at any given time.  The contents of the nurse tanks are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n  \r\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures, in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications, to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Mott Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tProcedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\r\n2.\tInformation on emergency health care.\r\n3.\tEmergency response training for employees.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of a hazard"

Recommended actions include the following:\r\n\r\n1. Provide additional information about emergency shutdown steps to the operating procedures\r\n2. Perform a hydro-static test for leaks on the underground piping\r\n3. Re-position valve valve between the west tank system and the east tank system\r\n4. Replace temperature probe in the regulator of the west riser\r\n5. Add piping color coding scheme into the operating procedures\r\n6. Create P&ID with a referenced equipment list\r\n\r\n\r\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental  elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describe methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during inspections, audits, and hazard analyses. Wilbur-Ellis is committed to preventing incidents cultivating a positive safety culture throughout the company. The mission of our Environmental Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) team is to drive effective results in reducing\r\nincidents and employee injuries by combining the GPS process with a positive safety culture."
