              "Description": "This Prevention Program incorporates, by this reference, the OSHA PSM program titled \"Process Safety Management Plan.\"  Jacobson Distribution Company recognizes the difference between the two programs.  That is, EPA's mandate is protection of the general public while OSHA's is protection of employee safety and health.  In other words, EPA's authority is offsite while OSHA's is onsite.  As a practical matter for our purposes the two programs dovetail well.  That is, measures described to prevent accidents that could expose employees to ammonia would also prevent a release that could have effects offsite.  Differences exist in terminology and regulatory references.  These differences are set forth in the Prevention Program document.",

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our emergency response procedure which includes notification of the Phoenix Fire Department to assist in responding to the emergency.  Emergency evacuation in the community would be coordinated through the Phoenix Fire Department.  The Phoenix Fire Department is aware of the potential hazards at our facility, our emergency response plan and their role in responding to emergencies.  We do have an Emergency Action Plan, Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management Plan in place and employees trained.  This facility undergoes annual internal Safety Audits withresults reported to management, including corrective actions.  We also conduct safety training annually with our staff."
