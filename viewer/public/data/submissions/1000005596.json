This facility is located at 725 State Road in Ashtabula.  At this facility, Gabepro manufactures a variety of specialty organic chemicals.  The facility was originally constructed in 1954 and employs 64 full-time employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (\u00c2\u00a7 68.155(a)):\n\nGabepro is committed to operating the Ashtabula Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, Gabepro has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Ashtabula Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and OSHA 1910.119. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Ashtabula Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the Ashtabula Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n* A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances)\n \n* A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes)\n\n* An emergency response program to help respon"

In fact, the Ashtabula Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nGabepro's policy on the use of hazardous substances:  Before using a hazardous substance at the Ashtabula Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Ashtabula Plant, Gabepro reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance, which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and/or Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for new installations or modifications of existing processes that handle hazardous materials.\n\nGabepro strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility:  Gabepro implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Ashtabula Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, Gabepro requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.

Gabepro utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation.  Gabepro trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, Gabepro works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  Gabepro has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Ashtabula County, Community Awareness and Emergency Response Plan (AC-CAER).\n\nAshtabula Plant's emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, Ohio and EPA regulations.  This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Ashtabula Plant.  If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities, the Ashtabula County-CAER Plan is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency.\n\nGabepro is an active participant in plant and community programs which promote education, safety and environmental awareness.  In addition, the Ashtabula Plant demonstrates community commitment by providing involvement and leadership in important local organizations such as the local Safety Council.  The Ashtabula Plant was a founding member of the Community Advisory Panel (CAP), which was formed in 1994.  Safety is a primary concern in our facility and throughout our organization. \n\n2.

The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.  The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and conducts regular audits of the contractor's work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n\n5   Five-year Accident History (\u00c2\u00a7 68.155(e)):\n\nThe Ashtabula has experienced no releases of hydrogen sulfide, epichlorohydrin, formaldehyde, or allyl alcohol in the past five years.\n\n6.  The emergency response program (\u00c2\u00a7 68.155(f)).\n\nThe Ashtabula Plant has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures. The written emergency response plan complies with the following federal and state contingency plan regulations:\n\n* OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38(a) - Employee Emergency Action Plans\n* OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 (n) - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\n* OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120(p) and (q) -  Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HazWOPER)\n* OSHA 29 CFR 1910, Subpart L - Fire Protection\n* EPA 40 CFR 302.6 - Notification Requirements\n* EPA 40 CFR 355.30 - Facility Coordinator and Emergency Res"

The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst case and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario. The EPA recommended Landview program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within this distance from the storage location.  USGS maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance.\n\n3.1 Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.  Propane is stored on-site in 30 lb. cylinders.   However, the total quantity is less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (\u00c2\u00a7 68.155(d)):\n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment outside the plant's fenceline.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Ashtabula Plant's Program 3 prevention program that address EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Ashtabula Plant's Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n4.1.1  Process Safety Information \nThe Ashtabula Plant maintains technical documents which are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes. These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  Gabepro ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees. \n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of th"

These logbooks provide an opportunity to emphasize key points and request specific tasks.\n\n4.1.4 Training\nThe Ashtabula Plant trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.  \n\n4.1.5 Mechanical Integrity\nThe Ashtabula Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meets the design standards required for service in the plant's processes.  The mechanical integrity program includes:\n\n* Specifications for inspection and testing of process equipment \n* Specifications for replacement parts and equipment \n* Procedures for inspecting, testing and maintaining process equipment \n* Procedures for safe work practices such as Lock, Tag and Try; Hot Work; Confined Space Entry; and Line Breaking\n* Training of maintenance personnel \n* Documentation of maintenance activities\n\n4.1.6 Management of Change \nThe Ashtabula Plant management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.
