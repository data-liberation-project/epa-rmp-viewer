This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES     \n\nThe Conway LPG Storage Facility is located on Kansas State Highway No. 56, approximately 6.5 miles west of McPherson, Kansas.  The Conway LPG Storage Facility provides storage and terminal operations for liquefied petroleum gas and unleaded gasoline.  Stored products are shipped from the facility via pipeline systems, trucks and railcars.  The Conway LPG Storage Facility is able to store enough propane, butane and other flammable materials to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for the Conway LPG Storage Facility is a vapor cloud explosion involving the worst possible release of a flammable mixture (predominately consisting of Normal Butane), from a LPG underground storage well having the largest casing diameter, greatest inventory, and highest pressure.  The release is assumed to last for 10 minutes after a shearing of the 13-3/8 inch outside diameter well casing from well #37.  The release forms a vapor cloud that ignites and explodes - creating a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the 1-psig overpressure endpoint is 0.8 miles.  Although there are "

      "SummaryText": "numerous controls to prevent such releases, and to manage their consequences, no credit for these measures was taken into account in evaluating this unlikely WCS. \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) that is used as a planning case at the Conway LPG Storage Facility is a release of propane due to an overfill of propane into a storage well that backs up through a 10-3/4 inch outside diameter brine line at brine pond #3.  The pumping rate of the pressurized propane liquid to the atmosphere is calculated at a rate of 514 pounds per minute.  This particular ARS is assumed to last for 10 minutes before operation of isolation valves, pumps, shutdowns and/or other mitigating actions can be utilized to mitigate the release.  Under this ARS, the released propane vaporizes and is accidentally ignited - causing a vapor cloud fire.  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the lower flammability limit endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 mile.  With a radius of 0.1 miles, this ARS would extend outside of the boundary of the Conway LPG Storage Facility.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \n  The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Facility.  The processes at the Conway LPG Storage Facility is regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Because RMP accident prevention requirements for these processes are essentially the same as PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements, and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the Conway LPG Storage Facility.  \n \n Employee Participation\n \n The Conway LPG Storage Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, "
