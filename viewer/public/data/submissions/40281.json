This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Hutchinson County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass Production of Anhydrous Ammonia and Urea Fertilizers.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia and Chlorine.  Ammonia is produced and distributed for use as a nitrogen fertilizer.  Chlorine is used for treating the cooling water within the process.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 2,447,045.00 lb. while Chlorine is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 24,000.00 lb..\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition, as well as M.W. Kellogg specifications.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.

The HAZOP methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated as per the requirements of the OSHA PSM Standard.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Agrium U.S. Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\nTraining\nAgrium U.S. Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years for operations personnel and more frequently if needed.  Refresher training is provided annually for all loading personnel.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAgrium U.S. Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.
