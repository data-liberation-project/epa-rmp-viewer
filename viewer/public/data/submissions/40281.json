This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Hutchinson County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass Production of Anhydrous Ammonia and Urea Fertilizers.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia and Chlorine.  Ammonia is produced and distributed for use as a nitrogen fertilizer.  Chlorine is used for treating the cooling water within the process.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 2,447,045.00 lb. while Chlorine is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 24,000.00 lb..\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition, as well as M.W. Kellogg specifications.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  We also have an air operating permit ID under "

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAgrium U.S. Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The HAZOP methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated as per the requirements of the OSHA PSM Standard.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Agrium U.S. Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\nTraining\nAgrium U.S. Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years for operations personnel and more frequently if needed.  Refresher training is provided annually for all loading personnel.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAgrium U.S. Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown"

Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Agrium U.S. Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Agrium U.S. Inc..  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nAgrium U.S. Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAgrium U.S. Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAgrium U.S. Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Agrium U.S. Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor?s work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n4.Five-year Accident History\nNo Accidents To Report.\n\n\n5.Emergency Response Plan\nAgrium U.S. Inc. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nHutchinson County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n6.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs part of our continuous improvement efforts, a flare has been installed for the destruction of releases that can occur from the urea plant's safety relief valves.  Alarms were installed on the continuous emissions monitoring system to provide an early detection of a release that is exceeding the permitted value.
