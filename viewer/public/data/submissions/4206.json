If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and theenvironment.  A detailed emergency response planhas been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  2. Facility Information - * The primary activity at the Kennewick Fertilizer Facility is the storage blending and sale of fertilizers to farmers.  * Aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  3. Product is transferred from the Walla Walla location by tank truck to a 20,000 gallon above ground storage tank at the Kennewick branch.  3. Aqua Ammonia Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios - The worst case scenario for the Kennewick Fertilizer Facility is the failure of the largest stoage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 144,400 pounds of 20% aqua ammonia.  The distance to te endpoint is .64 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likelypotential incident is a release of 15,200 pounds from a 30,000 gallon tank.  The distance to the endpoint .21 miles.  4. Accidental Release Prevention Program Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia - The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrousw Ammonia\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  5.
