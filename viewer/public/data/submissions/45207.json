It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies.  All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Gilcrest Gas Plant processes raw natural gas into pure methane, ethane, butane, propane, and other natural gas liquids.  The raw natural gas is received by pipeline.  The finished products are delivered to both pipelines and to a truck loading rack.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Gilcrest Gas Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Key elements of these programs include:\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nOperating Procedures:  The Gilcrest Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up,  (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround.  \n\nContractors: Gilcrest Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased mai"

The program includes Classroom, OJT, and written testing. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  \n\nIncident Investigation:  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts conce"

The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.  Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for Gilcrest Gas Plant is coordinated with Gilcrest / Platteville Fire Protection District.  This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  The Gilcrest Gas Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the Gilcrest / Platteville Fire Protection District.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Gilcrest Gas Plant has installed additional engineering safeguards.
