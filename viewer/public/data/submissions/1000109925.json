We maintain rigorous policies and procedures for the prevention of accidental releases and have established a robust emergency response plan to address any unforeseen incidents promptly and effectively. Our commitment to safety is paramount and fully comply with the EPA Clean Air Act regulations, the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and all relevant state and local requirements. The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia using proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the ammonia refrigeration system. Should an accidental release occur, this facility has coordinated with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee to plan a timely response to any accidental ammonia release while minimizing the impact to local community and environment.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility operates a close-loop ammonia refrigeration system containing refrigerant above the threshold quantity identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). We are fully compliant with all requirements stipulated by the EPA and OSHA regarding the handling of regulated substances.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nTo prevent accidental releases, we have implemented a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that includes regular maintenance, safety inspections, employee training, and the use of state-of-the-art equipment. Specific to ammonia, we employ chemical-specific prevention measures, such as leak detection and emergency shutdown systems. Our compliance with EPA, OSHA, and local regulations is integral to our prevention efforts.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no ac"

We collaborate closely with local emergency response organizations to coordinate efforts and swiftly mitigate any potential hazards. Our emergency response plan aligns with regulatory requirements. The Emergency Plan for this facility includes specific instructions for employees regarding the response procedures to an emergency. Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to the state emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as required by the EPCRA.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nWe are committed to a culture of continuous improvement in safety. Planned changes include ongoing staff training, continual maintenance, and mechanical integrity inspection activities in accordance with Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP), manufacturing guidelines, as well as regular assessments of our Risk Management Plan (RPM) and Process Safety Management Program (PSM) protocols. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
