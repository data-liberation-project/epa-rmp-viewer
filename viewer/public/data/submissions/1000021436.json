      "SummaryText": "The City of Ridgeland is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and health.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that includes procedures for the operation, maintenance, emergency response, and employee training associated with the regulated process at this facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible release of regulated substances and adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  The City of Ridgeland operates a water supply well located on Hardy Street in Ridgeland, Mississippi.  The City utilizes two one-ton cylinders of chlorine to disinfect water prior to distribution of water to end users.  The worst-case scenario for the Hardy Street water well involves the catastrophic release of both one-ton chlorine cylinders.  The potential radius of impact was estimated by the RMP*Comp program to be approximately 3.0 miles.  The likelihood of this type of release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario evaluated for the Hardy Street water well involves the release of chlorine from a disconnected transfer hose.  The potential radius of impact was estimated by RMP*Comp to be approximately 0.1 miles.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases resulting in significant onsite or off-site impacts have occured.  In the event of an accidental release of chlorine from the site, the City of Ridgeland Fire Department would be notified.  The Fire Department has the personnel and equipment to mitigate such situations."
