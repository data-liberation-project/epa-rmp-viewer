ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nO.K. Foods has established programs, procedures and safety devices to prevent exposure to personnel, community, the surrounding environment and to protect property assets.  Policies have been created to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  O.K. Foods strives to prevent potential releases through training and evaluation of policies, programs and procedures.  \r\n\r\nOK Foods emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  Working in conjunction with the Fort Smith Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe primary purpose of the facility is the processing of poultry products, in which one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is used above the threshold level.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our the main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \r\n\r\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\r\nTwo worst case scenarios have been chosen.  The first worst-case scenario for this facility involves the release of 8,995 pounds of ammonia from the largest high-pressure receiver located outdoors."

THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nOK Foods facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  All personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Maintenance and Refrigeration operators receive On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are observed by senior maintenance staff and are required to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.\r\n\r\n7. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nOK Foods works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fort Smith Fire Department and HAZMAT team on emergency preparedness.  Periodically meetings are conducted to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.  \r\n\r\n8. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nOK Foods trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  The Process Safety Management Program is reviewed and updated annually, which improved continuously through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians."
