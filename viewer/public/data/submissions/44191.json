(CMI) and its management have adopted, and fully support, a formal and continuing program of review, evaluation and modification of its operations, at all levels, so that the ability to maintain the health and safety of its employees, public and the environment is constantly verified and improved.  \n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nAt this facility, pentane, propane, butane, isobutane, dimethylether and difluoroethane, which are considered to be hazardous flammable chemicals, are stored above the EPA's threshold.  As required by federal law, accidental release prevention steps and an emergency response plan have been developed to ensure and promote the safe conduct of employees at CMI.  \n\n\n\nA company Safety Committee (SC) has been developed and functions to ensure and promote the safe conduct of employees at CMI.  The SC recommends to upper management policies and procedures for the safe conduct of employees at CMI and for compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations governing the use of toxic or hazardous substances.  It is the responsibility of the SC to:\n\n* Review technical and safety-related aspects of the manufacturing facility and the use of hazardous and toxic substances;\n\n* Develop and maintain Safety & Conduct Rules and the Employee handbooks\n\n* Limit or revoke the use of hazardous or toxic materials if such use presents a hazard to individuals or violates health and safety codes\n\n* Train everyone who encounters chemical hazards in the workplace, including outside contractors, temporary help and new employees on the Hazardous Communication Standard\n\n\n\nCMI's emergency response program covers the necessary elements to protect the public health and the environment.  The program has information and procedures for notifying the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases as well as procedures for first-aid, emergency response eq"

Procedures for reviewing and updating the plan as appropriate are also present in the plan.\n\n\n\nProcesses and products of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nCMI is primarily a blending and aerosol filling plant where precise amounts of specified chemicals are mixed and packaged in accordance with formulation specifications.  The finished products produced are aerosol in nature ranging from a few ounces to over a pound per unit.  Most units are packaged in shipping containers of 12 each per corrugated shipping carton.  Cartons of finished products are stored on wooden skids placed on pallet racking.  Finished goods of flammable nature are stored in a segregated fire rated area, which is separate from the main warehouse area.  Materials of a flammable nature which are used in drum quantities are stored in warehouse areas to meet or exceed EPA, State, and Federal regulation.  Solvents which exceed drum quantities such as alcohols, petroleum distillates, and glycol ethers are stored in underground tanks.  Liquefied Hydrocarbon Propellants such as propane are stored above ground in accordance with NFPA 58 and local fire district requirements.  Nonflammable priority pollutants are stored above ground in a diked area.  Materials stored in less than bulk quantities and not considered flammable (drums, pails, ect.) are segregated within the chemical storage area according to their hazard potential.  Acids and other oxidizers are stored away from reducing agents, acids away from bases, ect.\n\n\n\nCMI has five stationary tanks and a trailer tank, which is brought occasionally to the facility, that are considered one single process because the five tanks and trailer tank contain regulated substances above threshold quantities and are co-located so that if one tank releases, it is possible that the other five tanks could release as well.\n\n\n\nThe regulated chemicals above threshold quantities and the maximum amount stor"

Dimethylether - 16,160 lbs.\n\n6. Difluoroethane - 14,520 lbs.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nCMI has implemented many countermeasures and safeguards to prevent an accidental release.  There are three basic areas where a spill could potentially occur following an equipment failure.  These three areas are (1) the above ground storage tank area, (2) the underground storage tank area and (3) the chemical storage area located inside the plant.  \n\n\n\nThe first area of concern is the above ground tank area.  If a spill were to happen, countermeasures are in place to be protective of the land, air and people in the surrounding area.  The area surrounding the above ground tanks in the southeast quadrant is diked, in case of structural damage of equipment or other deleterious imperfections in the piping.  Any spillage is capsulated by the dike and can be recovered.  The area can be immediately cleaned through the use of pumps and/or absorbent material.  Above ground tank overflow during filling does not present a potential spillage problem because all tanks are pressure vessels, including the tanks containing mixtures of propane, butane, isobutane and dimethylether, and are filled under pressure with a liquefied gas to a level not to exceed 87.5% of normal maximum fill or that amount which does not exceed a 10% safety margin of the hydrostatic fill limit of the tank.  All above ground storage tanks are subjected to periodic integrity testing.  In addition, qualified company personnel are required to make routine visual inspections including tank integrity, tank supports, tank foundations, and leaked or spilled materials.  All above ground valves and pipelines are subject to periodic inspections by operating personnel.  \n\n\n\nThe second area of concern is the bulk storage of flammable mate"

      "SummaryText": "rials in underground storage tanks.  These flammable materials, including pentane, are stored in underground tanks in accordance with good engineering practices.  All of the underground tanks are considered safe since they utilize a triple containment system.  Should a leak occur in the primary containment vessel, a dual barrier prevents any chemical from finding its way into the environment.  The entire underground tank system has a series of sumps whereby monthly samples are drawn and analyzed to ensure that no leakage is occurring.  A team of qualified personnel has been trained to contend with spills in this area of the production facility.  \n\n\n\nThe third area where a spill could potentially occur is the chemical storage area.  The materials stored in this area are contained in quantities of fifty-five gallons or less.  Materials are separated by their chemical reactivity to minimize the possibility of spills causing any further deleterious situations.  This area is sealed from the remainder of the plant through the use of downgraded flooring in addition to the appropriate use of a diked area.  Any materials spilled in this area would be recovered and the area cleaned up through the use of a pump and/or absorbent material depending on the size and nature of the spill.  The chemical storage area is equipped with sufficient ventilation to allow safe working conditions during the cleanup of any spilled materials.  In addition, all walls are fire proof.  The inventory in the chemical storage area is rotated in order to preclude the possibility of the degradation of the containers.  A team of qualified personnel has been trained to contend with any spills in this area.\n\n\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program\n\n\n\nCMI is subject to the rules of OSHA PSM.

Although a formal PHA has not been completed, many of the facility's hazards have been addressed and countermeasures such as process controls, mitigation systems and monitoring/detection systems are currently installed.\n\n\n\nClaire has recently reviewed their safety information and determined that a new gas detection system should be installed.
