Dimethylether - 16,160 lbs.\r\n6. Difluoroethane - 14,520 lbs.\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nCMI has implemented many countermeasures and safeguards to prevent an accidental release.  There are three basic areas where a spill could potentially occur following an equipment failure.  These three areas are (1) the above ground storage tank area, (2) the underground storage tank area and (3) the chemical storage area located inside the plant.  \r\n\r\nThe first area of concern is the above ground tank area.  If a spill were to happen, countermeasures are in place to be protective of the land, air and people in the surrounding area.  The area surrounding the above ground tanks in the southeast quadrant is diked, in case of structural damage of equipment or other deleterious imperfections in the piping.  Any spillage is capsulated by the dike and can be recovered.  The area can be immediately cleaned through the use of pumps and/or absorbent material.  Above ground tank overflow during filling does not present a potential spillage problem because all tanks are pressure vessels, including the tanks containing mixtures of propane, butane, isobutane and dimethylether, and are filled under pressure with a liquefied gas to a level not to exceed 87.5% of normal maximum fill or that amount which does not exceed a 10% safety margin of the hydrostatic fill limit of the tank.  All above ground storage tanks are subjected to periodic integrity testing.  In addition, qualified company personnel are required to make routine visual inspections including tank integrity, tank supports, tank foundations, and leaked or spilled materials.  All above ground valves and pipelines are subject to periodic inspections by operating personnel.  \r\n\r\nThe second area of concern is the bulk storage of flammable mate"

      "SummaryText": "rials in underground storage tanks.  These flammable materials, including pentane, are stored in underground tanks in accordance with good engineering practices.  All of the underground tanks are considered safe since they utilize a triple containment system.  Should a leak occur in the primary containment vessel, a dual barrier prevents any chemical from finding its way into the environment.  The entire underground tank system has a series of sumps whereby monthly samples are drawn and analyzed to ensure that no leakage is occurring.  A team of qualified personnel has been trained to contend with spills in this area of the production facility.  \r\n\r\nThe third area where a spill could potentially occur is the chemical storage area.  The materials stored in this area are contained in quantities of fifty-five gallons or less.  Materials are separated by their chemical reactivity to minimize the possibility of spills causing any further deleterious situations.  This area is sealed from the remainder of the plant through the use of downgraded flooring in addition to the appropriate use of a diked area.  Any materials spilled in this area would be recovered and the area cleaned up through the use of a pump and/or absorbent material depending on the size and nature of the spill.  The chemical storage area is equipped with sufficient ventilation to allow safe working conditions during the cleanup of any spilled materials.  In addition, all walls are fire proof.  The inventory in the chemical storage area is rotated in order to preclude the possibility of the degradation of the containers.  A team of qualified personnel has been trained to contend with any spills in this area.\r\n\r\nProgram 3 Prevention Program\r\n\r\nCMI is subject to the rules of OSHA PSM.

The finished products produced are aerosol in nature ranging from a few ounces to over a pound per unit.  Most units are packaged in shipping containers of 12 each per corrugated shipping carton.

Liquefied Hydrocarbon Propellants such as propane are stored above ground in accordance with NFPA 58 and local fire district requirements.  Nonflammable priority pollutants are stored above ground in a diked area.
