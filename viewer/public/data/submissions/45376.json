Sabine Inc., general partner and Conoco Global Power Assets ? Sabine Inc., limited partner, which are subsidiaries of parent company ConocoPhillips Company and is operated and maintained by the E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Company.  The Dun & Bradstreet number for ConocoPhillips is 001368265.  The Cogeneration unit is located within the DuPont Sabine River Works (DuPont) facility.  The SRWCLP facility has a contract with DuPont to operate and maintain the Cogen unit and for shared services.  The daily onsite management oversight is the responsibility of the Operations & Maintenance Director, who is an employee of SRWCLP.  All safety-related activities applicable to the Cogeneration unit are in compliance with the corporate policies of DuPont.  These policies can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n* All safety and environmental incidents are preventable.\n\n* The Goal is Zero.  Zero injuries and zero incidents.\n\n\n\nCorporate policies are embodied in the numerous Safety, Health, Environmental, and Engineering Standards which apply globally.  At this facility the policies are implemented through the site Safety, Health, and Environmental Manual and the Process Safety Management Manual.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe SRWCLP facility is located within the boundaries of the DuPont SRW facility, which is located approximately 2 miles south of the city of Orange, TX in a rural setting on FM 1006.  The Dupont facility is located on 1,500 acres, which is divided between chemical process units, the employee recreation area, and bio-oxidation ponds.  The SRWCLP facility is located in between the DuPont and INVISTA process units on the North side of the DuPont facility.  The chemical facility is secure by chain link fence, video cameras, controlled entry, and a 24-hour security force.\n\n\n\nThe C"

      "SummaryText": "ogeneration unit is a dual train gas-fired combustion turbine cogeneration plant that produces steam and electricity.  The duct burners on the combustion turbine units have selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment to reduce the nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions.  Aqueous Ammonia (28 wt. %) is vaporized and injected into the duct burner exhaust.  The ammonia is a reagent in the SCR to reduce the NOX as the exhaust gases flow across a solid catalyst bed.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia is stored on site in a single storage tank.  The total capacity of the ammonia storage tank and feed system exceeds the threshold quantity for applicability to 40 CFR Part 68, the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  There are no other toxic or flammable materials on site that exceed the RMP threshold values.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe SRWCLP facility is subject to OPA-90 40 CFR 112 and the state of Texas EPCRA regulations as noted in section 9.8 of this RMP.  The SRWCLP facility implements management systems and practices that meet or exceed RMP Level 2 Prevention Program requirements to comply with these regulations.  The Cogeneration unit is not subject to 29 CFR 1910-119, the Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard because the aqueous ammonia concentration (28 wt. %) is below the PSM threshold of 44 wt. %.   \n\n\n\nPrevention Program 2 requirements are defined according to the following elements:\n\n\n\n* Safety information;\n\n* Hazard review;\n\n* Operating procedures;\n\n* Training;\n\n* Maintenance;\n\n* Compliance audits; and\n\n* Incident investigation.\n\n\n\nDuPont personnel operating and maintaining the SRWCLP facility conduct their activities under the requirements of the safety programs of the DuPont SRW facility.\n\n\n\nThe SRWCLP and DuPont SRW safety programs include:\n\n\n\n1.
