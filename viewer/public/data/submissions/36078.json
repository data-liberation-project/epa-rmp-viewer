The process is regulated by Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations (CCR) Section 5189 and Title 19 California Code of Regulations Section 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This is an RMP/Cal ARP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe Seneca Resources Corporation has a commitment to employee and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Reasonable controls have been and continue to be implemented as necessary in an effort to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe prevention program exceeds the requirements of these regulations and includes the following: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Start Up Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\nTraining includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, hot work permit procedure, safe work practices, and operating procedures.  All visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit.  Planned changes to improve site safety are established based on annual health, environmental, and safety audits, process safety management audits every three years and revalidation of the process hazards analysis every five years.  The last process hazard analysis was 1 March 2002.\n\nThe facility proce"

There are 8 tanks with a total capacity of 442,173 gallons, the largest of which is 92,340 gallons.  The storage level on each propane tank is administratively controlled not to exceed 88% of the tank?s maximum capacity, while the other tanks are administratively controlled not to exceed 90% of each tank?s maximum capacity.\n\nSeneca Resources Corporation maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The Belridge Gas Plant has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department ? Certified Unified Program Agency.  The facility maintains an air pollution control district permit to operate with the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District, Permit S-1242.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Kern County Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had any accidental releases in the five years proceeding this submittal.  \n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of flammable liquids.  Seneca Resources Corporation is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community."
