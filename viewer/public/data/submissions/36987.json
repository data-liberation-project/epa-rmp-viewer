Finally, the New Castle facility maintains the ongoing mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases associated with this process in the last 5 years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe New Castle facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan.  The New Castle facility has trained employees for an initial response team.  This team will don personal protective equipment (PPE) and be dispatched to control or stop a minor emergency or an accidental release or help move any employee(s) that has been affected by a 70 percent HF release.  If necessary, employees will be evacuated to a safe zone.\n\nIn the event of an emergency where off-site response is appropriate, it will be the policy of the New Castle facility to notify the New Castle Fire Department and/or the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and request that they respond to the emergency.  A fire, explosion, or other occurrence with the potential to create a release of the regulated substance (HF) from the process may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Public emergency responders will not be permitted to enter this area except as previously arranged with the Primary Emergency Coordinator (PEC), or other personnel as identified within this RMP.\n\nFinally, the New Castle facility has equipped an emergency control center.  The emergency control center is sited in a safe zone and will serve as the major communication link between the PEC and plant or corporate management as well as with local community offici"

      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed by Earth Sciences Consultants, Inc. (Earth Sciences) for Allegheny Ludlum Corporation's New Castle facility located on Route 38, New Castle, Indiana, and is pursuant to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n\nProcess Description and Regulated Substances\nThe New Castle facility has designed and operates a process for the storage and transfer of 70 percent hydrofluoric acid (HF) into process tubs.  This process includes a 8,000-gallon storage tank located in an acid storage area and piping used to supply 70 percent HF to the process tubs.  This process is located in a part of the plant that is designed for the handling and use of hydrofluoric acid.  The storage and use of 70 percent HF at the plant is hereafter referred to as \"the process\" in the remainder of this document.  The North American Industrial Classification System code for the facility is 331111.  The New Castle facility process is classified as a Tier II program since the facility is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119\n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe New Castle facility has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of HF.  The New Castle facility remains committed to the prevention of releases of HF.  In the event of a release, the New Castle facility is committed to a timely response in accordance with their Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and the applicable components of this RMP.  Accident prevention and emergency response programs are described in this RMP.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe New Castle facility has safe job procedures (SJP) in place:\n\n\u00b7 to evaluate the HF tank capacity and volume already in place before unloading begins;\n\u00b7 for the use of HF in pickling operations; and\n\u00b7 for the inspection of all process equip"
