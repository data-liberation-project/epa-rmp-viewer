Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis and the facility has a plan in place for evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies. Cargill also has personnel who are trained to respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. They receive training regularly, or more frequently at needed. The facility also utilizes the Fresno Fire Department to respond to chemical releases when necessary. Cargill has coordinated response needs with local emergency planning and response organizations on a regular basis.\n\n- Planned changes to improve safety [19 CCR 2745.3(f)]:\nCargill is committed to improving our PSM and RMP programs. In an effort to continually improve our systems, Cargill has an internal process for reviewing all of our open recommendations from audits and PHAs. Additionally, all process changes regarding ammonia refrigeration are reviewed by the site management team prior to making any change. This provides expert review from each critical discipline, i.e. personnel safety, environmental, process safety, etc.\n\nCargill has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility. We believe that the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation, and our commitment to continuous improvement that an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."

These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [19 CCR 2760.9]\nCargill promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [19 CCR 2760.10]\nCargill believes that PSM/RMP and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, Cargill employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [19 CCR 2760.11]\nCargill has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process.\n\nContractor Safety Program [19 CCR 2760.12]\nCargill occasionally hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Cargill has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n- The five-year accident history [19"
