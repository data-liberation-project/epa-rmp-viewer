              "Description": "Designing For Safety\n- The Department of Transportation (DOT) approved carriers are made of heavy gauge steel with reinforced bases.  This gives them a low center of gravity and makes them hard to tip over.\n- Dome cover lids protect the valve connections on the top.  Connections are blanked during transport.\n- The carriers have lead liners for corrosion prevention.\n- There is no bottom drain valve on the carriers; bromine liquid is discharged by pressure through a well line in the top of the carrier.\n- There is protected access to the bromine feed lines, making a break by impact improbable.\n- A dedicated warehouse area has been specified and clearly marked to protect the carriers from flammable substances.  Protective railings minimize the possibility of a chance impact by a fork lift.\nOperating Safely\n- A pressure relief valve is installed on the carrier when it is in the production area.  If a fire were to occur, the carrier could not pressurize to dangerous levels.\n- Bromine carriers within the building are not transported on pallets.  The carriers are equipped with slotted attachments so that a special fork truck can pick them up without tipping them over.\n- Bromine leaks are easily detected visually and by smell.  Since operating procedures require continual operator attendance during charging periods, reaction time to leaks will be minimized.  At all other times, procedures require pressure on the carrier to be relieved and the valves cut off to isolate the carrier from the process.\n- Procedures require two operators to be present to ensure correct valve sequencing/disconnection any time a carrier is removed. \n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work with the unloading stations are trained and qualified in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  regulations.\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n- Flex hose connectors to the process are replaced every six months, regardless of condition.\n- The supplier visually inspects the lead lining before filling and corrects deficiencies before use.\n- Every five years the carrier is physically opened to measure the lining thickness and is cleaned and water-tested to 1.5 times the design pressure.\nAuditing Our Operations\n- Bromine carriers undergo a safety inspection on a routine annual schedule.

Since operating procedures require continual operator attendance during charging periods, reaction time to leaks will be minimized.\n- Nitrogen is used to blanket the rail car during transfers.\n- Operations  verifies that the storage tank can hold the entire contents of the rail car before the transfer is started.\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work with the unloading stations are trained and qualified in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  regulations.\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n- The unloading line is visually inspected every time it is used.\n- Transfer lines are walked down annually to visually inspect for leaks and corrosion.\n- The nitrogen purges are inspected and the storage tank level is verified by an alternative method monthly.\n- The vent scrubber is visually inspected twice per day.\n- Critical instruments are routinely tested.\nAuditing Our Operations\n- The rail car is visually inspected every time a transfer is made.\n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is supplied at least every 3 years or as soon as a change in the process is made.\n- The process is subject to many types of inspections/audits such as Safety & Housekeeping inspections, tests & inspections as described above, lock/tag audits and Safe Work Permit audits  of maintenance procedures, a company Integrated Safety Audit, Industrial Hygiene Medical/exposure studies, etc.\n- Every five years the process and equipment is examined thoroughly by Process Hazard Analyses and Revalidations.",

Since operating procedures require continual operator attendance during charging periods, reaction time to leaks will be minimized.\n- Storage tank level is verified by a secondary method before material transfer is started.\n- An operator is always present during transfers.\n- Process line has flange covers and is distinctly marked.\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work with the unloading stations are trained and qualified in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  regulations.\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n- The process is visually inspected every year.\nAuditing Our Operations\n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is supplied at least every 3 years or as soon as a change in the process is made.\n- A routine inspection schedule helps maintain the integrity of process vessels and piping.",

              "Description": "Designing For Safety\n- Propylene is received in bulk trucks at a remote unloading station, and is transferred into a storage tank equipped with level indication that is continuously monitored in a control room and at local level indicators at the tank and at the unloading station.\n- Level indicator alarm and high-level shutoff switch (duplicate switches) will stop transfer when a level of 80% is reached.\n- The system is closed loop piping such that a tank overflow would be recirculated to the bulk truck.\n- The transfer line is underground, and is contained in monitored, open conduit with signs warning of underground lines.\n- The tank is equipped with pressure relief devices that direct any gasses to a flare.  System can also manually vent vessels to the flare.\n- All piping is hard-piped with no open exposure or handling. \n- Both the truck and the flex hose connectors used to unload the vendor bulk truck meet DOT requirements.\nOperating Safely\n- The operation of the storage tank is monitored continuously by operators using a distributed control computer system. \n- A person is stationed at the truck and another person is stationed at the tank during all transfers.\n- During transfers, all vehicular traffic near the unloading station  is stopped by barriers and gates.\n- New operators must complete an extensive apprenticeship program and be certified prior to operating the process. \n- Operators use detailed procedures, checklists, equipment drawings, etc. to operate the process.  The procedures and checklists are reviewed annually to ensure they are current and accurate. \n- Any changes to operating procedures or to equipment are thoroughly reviewed for potential impact on health, safety or the environment.  \n- The storage tank is isolated with redundant manual valves which are only opened when propylene is charged and an operator present. \nMaintaining Safe Operations\n- A visual inspection of all lines and equipment is done every three months.  \n- Process systems are inspected according to Eastman?s Mechanical Integrity Program.  \n- Combustible gas leak detectors are located throughout the process.  \n- The storage tanks and relief valves receive detailed inspections every two years by a State Certified Inspector.  \n- The area combustible gas leak detector system is checked by Certified Instrument Analyst.  \nAuditing Our Operations\n- The process is subject to many different types of inspections and audits such as weekly Safety and Housekeeping inspections, lock and tag audits and Safe Work Permit audits of maintenance procedures, and a company annual Integrated Safety Audit that looks at industrial safety issues.\n- Each operator receives routine refresher training for normal operation and emergency situations.  \n- Every five years the process and equipment is examined thoroughly by Process Hazard Analyses and Revalidations.",

Also, the cylinder valves are recessed to prevent the valves from being damaged  \n-The HF cylinders are not equipped with thermal or pressure relief.\n-The HF cylinder will be contained in an enclosed concrete cubicle.  There is protected access to the HF cylinder, making a break in the cylinder improbable.\n-The HF cylinder cubicle is equipped with emergency shutdown systems which will mitigate releases.\nOperating Safely\n-A fire inside  the HF cylinder cubicle is very improbable because no flammable material is stored in the area; therefore, overpressurization of a cylinder to dangerous levels is highly  unlikely.\n-Transporting of an HF cylinder will be minimal.  The HF cylinder will be directly delivered by the vendor to the HF cubicle.  Only one cylinder of HF will be on-site at a time.  There will be no other on-site or off-site inventorying of HF.\n-Leaks are easily detected visually and by smell.  In addition, there will be installed automatic HF detection systems at both the HF cylinder cubicle and in the production facilities to signal a release.  \n-The HF transfer supply line between the HF cubicle and the production facilities will be purges clear  between additions of HF.  The HF addition step is a small component of the batch cycle.   \n-The HF addition is DCS controlled. \n-The HF addition is a low pressure addition which is well below the design criteria of the piping system.\n-Procedures require two operators, in appropriate PPE, to be present during the HF cylinder installation to process piping connection/disconnection operations.\n-Operators and  mechanics who work with the HF system are trained and qualified in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations. \n-DCS interlocks and ESD systems (both software and hardwired) are  in place to ensure the safe handling and addition of HF and to safely terminate an HF addition should a release occur.\n\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n-Flex hose connectors to the process are routinely inspected  to be in good condition as part of the operating procedure. \n-The HF cylinder to process piping  and the HF reactor system  are routinely pressure checked for leaks by procedure to ensure the operating system is free of leak points. \n-HF detection systems are routinely calibrated.\nAuditing Our Operations\n-HF cylinders undergo a safety inspection by the vendor on a routine schedule.  Discrepancies and defects are corrected before further use.\n-A routine inspection schedule ensures the integrity of gaskets, gauges, and gauges.\n-Annual functional tests of the HF system interlock and ESD procedures ensure operability of the systems.",

The Volunteer Star program, administered by the State of Tennessee Department of Labor, is Tennessee's version of the federal Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a cooperative effort between employers and OSHA to improve worker safety and recognize outstanding safety performance and programs.  Fewer than 400 sites nationwide have qualified for Star status.\n\n\n\n\nV. Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the five years previous to the submission of this report, the Tennessee Eastman Division has had only one RMP reportable incident. In 1998, the Tennessee Eastman Division experienced a release of 200 gallons of anhydrous ammonia to the air and to the Holston River, which had an adverse affect on some aquatic life.  There was no impact on either plant personnel or the community.\n\n\nVI. Emergency Response  Program\n\nGeneral Emergency Response Practices for All Chemicals:\n\n1. Eastman emergency response personnel use a computerized modeling system to predict the concentration and location of any vapor cloud resulting from a hazardous vapor release.  The system is able to provide real-time monitoring of the weather to enhance protection of anyone who may be impacted in the plant and in the community.\n2.
