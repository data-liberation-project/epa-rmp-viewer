The Brenntag facility resides on the northeast corner of the Olin site and wholly owns and operates this facility. The main products produced at St. Gabriel is sodium hypochlorite and repacking chlorine.  Chlorine is an element that occurs naturally as sodium chloride (table salt). Brenntag's products play an important role in the purification of drinking water, treating swimming pools and industrial waters and laundry bleach.\r\n\r\nBrenntag's environmental and safety and health policies recognize the importance of safeguarding the environment and protecting the community throughout the manufacturing process.  Programs are in place to ensure compliance with regulations and continuing improvement of performance over the years.  Facility personnel are trained extensively in safe operation of the facility and in maintaining compliance with all applicable regulations. Operations employees at the Brenntag site are all 40-hr HAZWOPER trained and undergo an annual 8-hr refresher.\r\n\r\nChlorine is the only chemical at the facility that falls under the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nBrenntag has developed an accidental release prevention program based on the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management Program.  Each of the 12 elements is fully implemented and integrated into the standard operating practices of the plant.  Summarized below are brief descriptions of each of the elements:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information - Critical information on chlorine properties, chlorine handling and chlorine repackaging techniques, is made readily available to facility personnel through Material Safety Data Sheets, current drawings, and comprehensive operations manuals.  Additionally, the Chlorine Institute provides information and guidelines in the form of regula"

This information is used as the basis for many of our operating procedures and chemical process systems.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis - Brenntag performs Process Hazard Analyses on an established schedule.  A trained team rigorously scrutinizes the operating processes and makes recommendations for safety enhancements.  The recommendations are then prioritized and implemented accordingly.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures - Clear and concise instructions have been developed by experienced personnel for all facility operations. The operating instructions are kept current by regularly scheduled annual review, and by integrating the Management of Change procedures.\r\n\r\nTraining - Employees are thoroughly trained on the technical aspects of the manufacturing process including on the job (OJT) training and operating procedures that lead them step by step through the necessary operating instructions.  The training program is ongoing and used to continually enhance the capabilities of all plant employees.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity - The Mechanical Integrity program in place at the plant is specifically designed to keep our equipment in viable condition.  Operations personnel ensure all pipes, tanks, valves and mechanical equipment involved in chlorine service are checked prior to placing in service on a daily basis.  Chlorine equipment is inspected and tested on an established schedule as established by the Chlorine Institute.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change - Written procedures are in place to ensure that all process changes at the plant undergo review at the planning stage.  No changes are made without review by a team that includes engineering, operations and maintenance personnel.  Once a process change has been made, systems are in place to make sure that communication of the change will be made to all that may be affected.\r\n \r\nPre Startup Reviews - Before being placed into service, any new or modified system is thoroughly reviewed by engineering and operati"

All recommendations from the review are then completed before start up.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits - Internal audits will be performed by the Site Manager and the operations supervisor.  Recommendations from the audits are reviewed by the executive committee and are promptly converted into action plans.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - Significant environmental, safety, or health incidents at the facility are fully investigated by appropriate teams to determine root cause and to put in place action plans designed to prevent recurrence.  The findings are documented and communicated to facility personnel.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - Employees are very involved in all aspects of the process safety management program.  Employee participation is the cornerstone of the Voluntary Protection Program.\r\n\r\nHot Work - The facility's Hot Work procedure requires that detailed permitting activities take place before, during, and after any job that has the potential to provide a source of ignition.\r\n\r\nContractor Safety - The contractor safety program, places stringent qualification requirements on contracting firms.  To become qualified to work at the facility, contractors must provide proof of training that matches our tough requirements.  Additional facility specific training is then required before any contract work can take place.  Contractor safety performance and compliance with facility safety requirement are monitored closely during all contract projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Brenntag facility is located in close proximity to the Olin Chlor Alkali Company, Inc. facility in St. Gabriel.  Brenntag has implemented an emergency response plan which works in conjunction with the local emergency response agencies and industrial neighbors.  \r\n\r\nBrenntag's personnel are trained to handle minor emergencies with back up assistance from Olin's ER team if neces"

Brenntag and Olin work closely together to insure adequate response personnel are available to respond if necessary. \r\n\r\nHypothetical Models\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has defined the worst case scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility's largest storage tank, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extremely stable weather conditions.  While the probability of this scenario coming to pass at any facility is extremely low, it does provide a template for emergency response planning.  \r\n\r\nThe computer-generated model for our worst case scenario is the full release of a chlorine container while filling or in storage.  It is assumed that the full contents of the DOT ton container (2,000 lbs) is released in 10 minutes which results in a planning zone of 0.9 miles.\r\n\r\nEach facility must also prepare an alternate scenario that could have an off-site impact, based on plant operations.  As the alternate scenario we have selected a transfer hose failure used in filling the ton chlorine containers.  The computer-generated model for this release results in a possible impact of up to 0.2 miles. The assumptions made for this scenario include the sensors shutting off the main emergency closure valve (AutoMax) isolating 287 feet of 3\" active chlorine line, 15 feet of 1\" line, and 3 feet of 3/4\" transfer hose. This line, fully loaded, captures about 1520 lbs of chlorine and it will be released in a 10 minute timeframe. During this time Brenntag personnel will actively mitigate this release by redirecting this line to the scrubber for neutralization after donning the appropriate response PPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-Year History  No incidents in the last 5 years to report.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSafety\r\n\r\nBrenntag is committed to a continuous improvement process.
