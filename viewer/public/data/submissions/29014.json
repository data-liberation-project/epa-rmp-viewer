      "SummaryText": "A. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nSouthern Gardens Citrus Processing Corporation (the Company) recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility. \n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has developed a Plant Safety Program based on the Voluntary Protection Program guidelines. The mission of the plant Safety Program is to provide a safe work environment through involvement, commitment, and genuine caring by all employees. Efficiency and safety performance is measured by closely tracking Lost Work Day Index and Injury Illness Rates.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs, which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation. The Utilities Team Leader is responsible for the management of accidental release prevention and the Safety Resource is responsible for management of the Emergency Response Programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic events. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Company operates a fruit juice processing facility at this location. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the systems is in exc"

      "SummaryText": "ess of 10,000 pounds and the maximum inventory is 139,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and since the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard, this facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nIn the ammonia refrigeration system, ammonia is transformed from vapor to liquid then back to vapor by mechanical compression, expansion, and evaporation in order to exchange heat to achieve a desired temperature in the storage and processing areas. The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the compressors to the condensers where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a liquid. The liquid from the condensers is collected in a high-pressure receiver.\n\nThe liquid ammonia is then circulated to the units (freezers, air units, storage tanks, and chillers) located in the production and storage areas. The ammonia liquid flows across heat exchanger surfaces (coils, tubes, or freezer barrels) where it picks up heat, changing from a liquid to a vapor. The ammonia vapor is then sent back to the compressor to start the cycle over.\n\nC. Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility involves release of 27,037 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to failure and loss of entire contents of the recirculator, which is located outside. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 2.9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (i.e. reaching a concentration less than 0.14 mg/L) according to the Ammonia Guidance method.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n?The worst-case weather conditions that were used for this scenario do not occur every day.\n?Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pressure vessels.\n?Ammonia is not corrosive in this service and the vessel is relatively new.\n?Pressur"

This may be due to a break in the 8? fill line to the plant.  Under alternative release weather conditions and taking the building protection into account, the ammonia could travel 0.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public in accordance with the Ammonia Guidance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n?An automatic pressure cutoff system would minimize the release; \n.The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; \n?The facility has emergency response procedures, which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases; and \n?The facility has an active preventative maintenance program which may identify a problem with the pipe before it breaks.\n\nD.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility?s process exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA PSM Standard 1910.119, and the facility is therefore subject to the PSM requirements. For RMP compliance purposes, this places the refrigeration process at the facility in the Program 3 level. Therefore, the facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n?Employee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also involved when a pr"

Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards of the system. The written information includes the ammonia Material Safety Data Sheet and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n?Process Hazard Analysis: Qualified plant personnel have conducted studies, using the What-If Technique, to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\n?Operating Procedures: Written, detailed procedures have been developed to describe the steps that should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration process. \n?Training: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties that they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. \n?Contractors: All contractors are evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system. The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure safe work practices are followed. \n?Pre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been conducted, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. \n?Mechanical Integrity.

Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo ammonia-related incidents were identified for the facility in the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\nF. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan has been implemented for the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. The program has been coordinated with local Fire Departments. In addition, an emergency response consultant, Southwest Florida Safety Consultants, conducts biweekly HAZMAT drills on site. This training is available to all employees.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan consists of the following elements:\n\n. Organization Plan and Responsibilities\n. Communications Systems\n.
