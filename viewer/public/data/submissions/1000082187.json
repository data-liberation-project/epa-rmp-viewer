The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Williams, \"Rocky Mountain Midstream\" Fort Lupton Gas Plant is located near Fort Lupton, Colorado. It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (i.e.: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce a pipeline quality gas (primarily methane). There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances at the Fort Lupton Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Williams, \"Rocky Mountain Midstream\" Fort Lupton Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific process safety management (PSM) program that consists of all the required 14 elements of PSM. The facility has also implemented a Program 3 Prevention Program that mirrors PSM requirements, where applicable, and integrates required aspects of public health and safety relative to plant operations.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Williams, \"Rocky Mountain Midstream\" Fort Lupton Gas Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Williams, \"Rocky Mountain Midstream\" Fort Lupton Gas Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.
