While these items and parts have an extremely wide range of applications, our core mission is to supply products with a direct application to aviation.  These items include a mix of military-unique items supporting over 1,300 major weapons systems and other items readily available in the commercial market.  \n\nWith over 600 acres and approximately 120 warehousing, utility and administrative buildings totaling over 6.7 million square feet, however, Defense Supply Center Richmond is host for a number of other Department of Defense, federal and state organizations. The largest of these tenants are the 350-acre Defense Distribution Depot Richmond Virginia; the Defense Distribution Mapping Activity; the Virginia Army National Guard vehicle maintenance activity, and the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office. The center and its tenant activities employ nearly 3,000 civilians, service members and contractor personnel, whose mission is to provide critical material support across the Department of Defense and other federal agencies, including NASA.\n\n2. Types of Chemicals and Processes Present at DSCR\n\nAlthough ozone-depleting substances form a substantial proportion of chemicals stored at DSCR, many other chemicals are present in significant quantities.  (Note that ozone-depleting substances are typically not regulated by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.)  Among these chemicals are hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, chlorine, acetylene, hydrogen, propane, formaldehyde, hyd"

      "SummaryText": "rofluoric acid, and ethylene oxide, and engine starting fluid (ethyl ether).  All of these substances are regulated by the RMP rule as either toxic or flammable substances.\n\nOther than storage of ozone-depleting substances, the Defense Distribution Depot performs an important function  the reclamation and refurbishing of ODS and inert gases (such as oxygen, argon, and nitrogen).  While the ODS are recovered, inert gases are bled to the atmosphere.  After the ODS have been reclaimed, the empty cylinders are cleaned, tested, and re-certified (or rejected) by persons qualified by the Bureau of Explosives.  This process is known as the refurbishment of the ODS cylinders.\n\nWhen the initial RMP was prepared in 1999 not only was the storage of materials and the refurbishment of containers investigated but, several other activities which occur at the installation were investigated from the standpoint of the RMP rule.  Building 80 houses the Equipment Maintenance Branch, consisting of Material Handling & Equipment and the Automotive and Heavy Equipment shop.  While there are many activities here that involve the use of chemicals, such chemicals are typically not covered by the RMP rule.  Examples of the chemicals handled are paints and solvents (in the automotive paint booth), degreasing solvents (mainly containing naphtha), new and spent engine oils, batteries, tires, and other materials generally associated with vehicle maintenance.  Similar operations are being conducted over at the Virginia Army National Guard Facility.  The results of the investigation determined that there are no chemicals present in Building 80, or over at the Virginia Army National Guard facility which the RMP Program would apply.\n\n3. Distribution and Warehousing of Materials\n\nOnce a substance arrives at DSCR, the substance is inventoried; a stock number is assigned, and in turn distributed to the appropriate warehouse or storage location.  Ozone-depleting substances are typically sent to Building 64"

Containers of propane, acetylene, and chlorine are received in the open-storage area, these containers are generally considered to be empty and the amount remaining inside the cylinders is marginal.  \n\nDSCR also receives substances which are designated for redistribution to other supply centers in the Defense Logistics Agency.  These are stored in various locations throughout the Depot.  The following is a list of primary storage locations in the Depot.\n\n* Warehouse 8.  This is where flammables, oxidizers, and poisons are stored.\n* Warehouse 9.  This is where non-hazardous materials are stored.\n* Warehouse 12.  Non-flammable substances are stored here.\n* Warehouse 13.  This building is used to store corrosive materials.\n* E07 to E10.  Petroleums, oils, and lubricants (POL) are stored in these locations.\n* Building 54.  Storage of small binable items, station returns, and closed depot stocks.  (Examples of materials stored are gloves, electrical power distributors, track shoes, tents, thermometers, batteries, and lubricating oil.)\n* Building 94D001.  Used primarily for storage of chlorine cylinders.\n* Building 95D001 and D002.  Cylinders of ozone-depleting substances and hydrogen.\n* Building 95D003.

Data Management and Availability of Storage Records\n\nBecause of the large number of items and materials that pass through DSCR, and because of the large volumes of these items and materials, computerized databases were essential to reviewing the installation's inventorie"

      "SummaryText": "s.  The Depot has a database known as the Distribution Standard System (DSS).  This system allows data to be sorted by materials, stock number, storage location, hazard code, available balance, and other data fields.  This database was invaluable in identifying RMP-regulated chemicals present at the Depot, their location, and the quantities in which they are being stored.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program is currently being implemented at DSCR.  The Fire Prevention and Protection Division (the Fire Department) at DSCR follows written procedures for emergency response notification and coordinates activities related to fire, rescue, and hazardous material response.  A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between DSCR and the County of Chesterfield, VA has been signed.  Mutual Aid agreements for assistance (fire protections, spill response, and medical assistance) are established with the Chesterfield County Fire Department.  Members of the LEPC attend and conduct training exercises and DSCR personnel participate in the training sessions.\n\n6. Processes Subject to the RMP Rule\n\nAs of April 7th, 2004 there were 5 substances at DSCR that were stored in 6 locations which are subject to EPA's RMP rules.  All of these substances directly involve the warehouse storage operations of DSCR.  A list of these processes, along with their storage locations and quantities of each regulated substance present is given below.\nChemical                 Warehouse    Storage Location   Quantity Stored    Threshold Quantity\n\nHydrochloric Acid          13             Bay 6                   18,995                15,000\nHydrochloric Acid          13             Bay 7                   45,907                15,000\nHydrochloric Acid          13             Bay 8                   5,200                  15,000\nHydrochloric Acid          13             Bay 9                   2,548                  15,000\nHydrochloric Acid          13             Bay 10                 145"

For each regulated chemical in a process this analysis involved:\n\n1) Determining the largest quantity of the regulated substance that can be released from the process in a 10-minute period;\n2) Applying passive mitigation factors (such as those created by releases in enclosed spaces) to reduce the quantity that escapes into the outdoor environment;\n3) Estimating the area of impact (represented by a circle, with the radius being the distance up to which there could be adverse impacts on human health or the environment);\n4) Estimating the number of people offsite and identifying environmental receptors offsite that would be adversely impacted by an accidental release of the chemical; and\n5) Determining if the process has been involved in any accidental releases during the past five years that resulted in injuries, deaths, evacuations, and other similar emergency situations offsite, or damage to the environment.\n\nThe analytical procedures outlined above were applied to each of the processes listed above.  The results showed that none of the processes has the potential for off-site impacts.  Furthermore, none of these processes has been involved in any accidental releases during the past five"
