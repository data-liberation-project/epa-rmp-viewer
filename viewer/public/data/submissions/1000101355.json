BMCP is organized into three business units: Olefins, Aromatics & Utilities, and Catalyst & Synthetics.  The RMP-covered processes per the criteria in 40 CFR Part 68 are located within the Olefins, Aromatics, and Catalyst & Synthetics business units. Out of the nine (9) RMP processes, eight (8) processes handle regulated flammable substances and mixtures, and one (1) process handles Boron Trifluoride.\nThe facility occupies 58 acres built along the banks of the Neches River. \n\n3.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nBMCP has developed effective programs to comply with the industry's most stringent environmental, health, and safety standards, including the American Chemistry Council's mandatory Responsible Care Program, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nAdditionally, BMCP was the first in the nation to have all its facilities certified as STAR facilities in OSHA's VPP. Facilities in the STAR program are required to demonstrate exemplary safety performance and agree to work cooperatively with OSHA to serve as an example for the industry.  They are audited by OSHA for compliance every few years. Heritage sites in BMCP were among the first facilities in the nation to earn the prestigious STAR recognition and have maintained it through ten OSHA inspections over a 41-year period.\n\nBMCP takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

This section addresses the following elements: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Changes, Incident Investigation and Compliance Audits. \n\nEmployee Participation\nBMCP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to information created as part of the BMCP accident prevention program, which is documented in an employee participation plan. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nBMCP keeps a variety of documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, BMCP has identified Operating Envelopes, i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, composition, etc. BMCP ensures that the process is maintained within these safe limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems).\n\nBMCP also maintains numerous documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. These documents include information such as materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nBMCP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. BMCP primarily uses the Knowledge-Based and Guideword Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) studies to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique. These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.
