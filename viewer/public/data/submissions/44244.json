At this facility, we store and distribute frozen food \nproducts to our stores.\n\nLike most cold storage warehouses, we use anhydrous ammonia in \nour refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant \navailable for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight \nflammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nGolub Corporation is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing \noperation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our \nrefrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well \nas industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  Finally, \nto comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, \nwe have a Process Safety Management program to help us operate and \nmaintain the system safely.\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials \ninstead of merely responding to problems.  Our Process Safety \nManagement program includes elements addressing:\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\npoints in our program.\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\nsafety of ammonia and the design limits of the refrigeration system so\nthat our employees are fully informed.\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\nrefrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\nrefrigeration equipment.\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We are establishing a\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring.\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance\nof the refrigeration system.\n- Management of Change: Alterations to "

The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is\nprescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the\nlikelihood or \"risk\" of these incidents. \n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves loss of the contents of a\nhigh-pressure receiver vessel over ten minutes. As required, this\nscenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 200 ppm ammonia\nis reached beyond the property line. \n\nThe alternative scenario involves lifting of a relief valve, a safety\ndevice provided on all vessels to prevent accidents such as the one\nspecified as the \"worst-case.\" The alternative scenario also has\noffsit"
