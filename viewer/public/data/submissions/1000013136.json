The refinery has a crude oil processing capacity of 247 MBPD. The refinery's location, configuration and product slate are all well suited to supply motor fuels into the southeastern United States. Major products produced include:  gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, heating oil, carbon black feed stock (CBFS), coke, benzene, propane, xylene, and sulphur. These operations remain largely unchanged since the original Risk Management Plan (RMP) was submitted by BP Amoco to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in June of 1999.\r\n\r\nAs a company, Phillips66 is committed to protecting the health, safety and environment wherever we operate. We will not be satisfied until we succeed in eliminating all injuries, occupational illnesses, unsafe practices, and incidents of environmental harm.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals, Alliance Refinery  approximately 750 employees and contractors are provided with the necessary tools to operate and maintain the refinery safely and in optimum condition. The Alliance Refinery started operations in 1971 and remains one of the country's most efficient and modern refineries.\r\n\r\nIn response to the EPA 1996 Risk Management Program regulations, the Alliance Refinery, then part of BP Amoco Oil Company, submitted to the Agency a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in June of 1999. This was required of all facilities that handle certain toxic and/or flammable chemicals above pre-defined threshold amounts. Said submittals provided the EPA with information about these chemicals, the potential risk they pose to the community, and the many ways that facilities like Alliance Refinery address and manage those risks.\r\n\r\nAlliance Refinery is subject to this rule due to the presence of flammable mixtures that con"

In addition to flammables, the refinery stores and uses one toxic chemical, hydrogen fluoride (HF), in quantities above the RMP threshold amount. As reported in the original RMP submittal, HF is used in the alkylation process. In 1999 chlorine was reported as one of our toxic chemicals, but it has since been removed from the refinery as described in the 2005 submittal.\r\n\r\nAlliance Refinery made the following minor process changes since the 2005 submission:\r\n-  Calculations for the maximum on-site inventories of RMP-regulated substances were revised and updated in this submittal;\r\n-  Process 406 Dock/LPG Unit was redefined to include just the Docks, where before it included the LPG unit.   Unit 100, which was not in the previous submittal, now includes the LPG and gasoline storage. \r\n A\u00bf Processes 891 DCU Coker, 1291 FCCU, 491 Alkylation, 294 Low Sulfur Gasoline and 6191 Light Ends Recovery were redefined to include KO Drums that previously were included in the process 308 Flare. Process 308 Flare was removed since it does not contain more than the defined threshold quantity of regulated flammable mixture or HF as toxic.\r\n\r\nAlliance Refinery Risk Management Program was originally developed and implemented by BP Amoco in compliance with OSHA PSM requirements (29 CFR Part 1910.119). This Program was described and the major components were discussed in the original 1999 RMP submittal. When Phillips66 purchased the refinery all policies, procedures and practices were reviewed, revised and updated to reflect the company business practices.\r\n\r\nThe discussion presented in the original RMP about the systems that Alliance Refinery has in place to prevent chemical release incidents from occurring included, but was not limited to the following:\r\n1.0 Hazard Ass"

The hazard assessment consists of two major components: an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) and a five-year accident history.\r\n\r\n1.1 Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\r\nFor the offsite consequence analysis, companies must report worst case scenarios (WCS) for each class of regulated substances -- flammable and toxic. Alternative release scenarios (ARS) are required for flammable chemicals as a class and for each RMP toxic chemical that is present at the facility above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Summary of the original submittal included discussion of Alliance RefineryA\u00bfs WCS and ARS for flammables and toxics. The Toxics and Flammables Worst Case inventory were updated and offsite consequences were reviewed in this submittal. Toxics offsite consequences have not changed and flammables offsite consequences changed insignificantly. The other scenarios have not changed since the original 1999 RMP submittal, and they will not be further discussed herein.  Amendments to the RMP regulations (proposed at 68 FR 45125, July 31, 2003 and finalized at 69 FR 18819-18832, April 9, 2004) eliminated the requirement to discuss a facilityA\u00bfs OCA in the Executive Summary.\r\n\r\n1.2 Five Year Accident History\r\nThe Alliance refinery is proud of its safety record throughout its operating history, and in well over 5 years, it has not had any accidental releases of regulated toxic chemicals that resulted in any significant offsite health, e"

The incident did not result in any onsite or offsite injuries, or offsite impact, but qualifies as RMP-reportable because it caused a significant amount of property damage inside the refinery.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred on February 19, 2007, when a bearing failure on a pump in the Low Sulfur Gasoline Unit resulted in a unit shutdown and release of approximately 500 barrels of heavy gasoline, containing approximately 3 barrels of benzene. A small portion of the release vaporized to atmosphere, a portion was collected in the process waste water system, and a portion of the remaining vapor condensed onto the ground adjacent to the unit. There were no onsite or offsite health or environmental effects resulting from the incident. The onsite property damage amounted to approximately $100,000, and there were no offsite economic effects.\r\n\r\n2.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\r\nAlliance Refinery developed and implemented its process safety management (PSM) program in the early 1990's, in response to the Occupational Safety Health AdministrationA\u00bfs (OSHAA\u00bfs) promulgation of the regulations contained in 40 CFR Part 1910.119, which provide guidance to industry for developing and maintaining a Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The RMP general accident prevention program requirements are based on the OSHA PSM standard; therefore Alliance RefineryA\u00bfs PSM program also meets the requirements of the RMP regulations. Alliance RefineryA\u00bfs PSM program was summarized in the original RMP submittal and it is again summarized below (with minor changes, where and as applicable):\r\n- Employee Participation - All employees are encouraged to actively participate in the prevention programs at Alliance Refinery.\r\n- Process Safety Information A\u00bf Alliance Refinery keeps detailed information about all"

This information is readily accessible to all personnel. This allows for the safe operation and maintenance of the refinery.\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - PHA's are studies that refinery teams periodically perform to make sure that equipment is designed, built, and operated within safe limits. PHAA\u00bfs are performed or updated for each PSM covered process at least every 5 years. PHAs are also performed before a significant change is made to a process. All recommendations are tracked to closure.\r\n- Operating Procedures  - Alliance Refinery has written operating procedures that address different modes of operation (normal operations, start-up, shutdown, and emergency,) at the refinery and serve as a reference for experienced personnel and a training tool for new employees. All procedures are certified annually.\r\n- Training - The refinery has an extensive on-going training program that addresses both training for new employees and refresher training for all operators. Employees are not allowed to work independently until they have demonstrated adequate knowledge in a process, and records are kept on each employee's progress.\r\n- Contractors - Contract workers at the refinery follow the same safety procedures as Phillips66 employees. Alliance Refinery evaluates contractor safety performance when selecting a contractor and monitors contractors to ensure that they are working safely.\r\n- Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) A\u00bf Alliance Refinery performs PSSR's when there is a change to any of the operating units at the refinery.

These include plant security, hot work and confined space permits and procedures, and procedures to secure equipment (Lock-out/Tag-out) before maintenance is performed. The safe practice procedures are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they are current and complete and that the necessary changes are done timely to reflect changes in the process, chemicals, technology, equipment and/or operating practices.\r\n- Management of Change (MOC) - The MOC system at Alliance Refinery ensures that all significant equipment, process or operating changes are reviewed prior to making the change to ensure that the change is technically and operationally sound and it is consistent with Phillips66A\u00bf practices and procedures.\r\n- Incident Investigation - Alliance Refinery promptly investigates all incidents and near misses at the refinery. All investigations are reviewed with Site Management and action items are tracked to closure.  Investigation results are communicated to all employees. This provides a mechanism to learn from accidents and improve safety.\r\n- Compliance Audits - Every three years, Phillips66 corporate auditors conduct an audit in Alliance Refinery to make sure that all of the safety programs are in place and functioning properly. In addition, Alliance Refinery conducts in-house audits and inspections that are a part of a HSE/PSM Internal Audit Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the General Accidental Release Prevention Program elements, Alliance Refinery has safety features on the refinery's process units to help (1) prevent/contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of, or mitigate a release.
