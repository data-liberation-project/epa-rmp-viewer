The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia.

Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tag out, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Del Monte Fresh Produce, Inc. facility is located at 14550 La Estrella. The facility is approximately 0.4 miles south of the State Highway 85 in on the south side of Goodyear, Arizona.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mix of farm land, offices, manufacturing, and an airport.\n\n \n\nThe Del Monte Fresh Produce facility was constructed in 1998. The primary business of this location is cooling, cold storage and ripening of produce.  \n\n\n\nThe facility uses 16,000 pounds of ammonia in a single closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\nThe refrigeratio"

IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n\n\nPrevention programs are in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the EPA Risk Management Program.  \n\n\n\nEngineering Measures: It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\n\n\n\n Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over-pressurization. The pressure relief valves vent to a water diffusion tank to prevent an atmospheric release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nAn emergency pressure control box allows control of system pressures during an emergency such as an ammonia release or fire.   This system will allow pressure to be controlled by relieving ammonia into the water diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration mechanical room and coolers are equipped with an ammonia de"

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia and, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the operator plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).
