If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nOur facility stores and blends fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored at our facility in one 18,000 gallon and one 12,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 127,500 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be 76,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.9 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenarios based on either the five year accident history or the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3 inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an aiutomatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quanity released would be 26,640 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.1 miles.\n\nOur facility has been reviewed for general compliance with applicable standards for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The standards for anhydrous ammonia include the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1m published by the American National Standards Institutte, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U."

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
