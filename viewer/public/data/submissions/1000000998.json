One system consisting of 14,800 lbs. Controls temperatures in the freezer. The second system is a 6,000 lb. Capacity system controlling the temperature in the Perishable building.\n\nThe freezer has frozen product, i.e.: meat, ice cream, vegetables, breads, cakes, pre-packaged meals and anything else that can typically be found in the frozen department of any grocery store. The Perishable building products are those items that need temperature control but should not be frozen. These items might be packaged meats, dairy products and poultry.\n\nPSM and RMP. As well as many safety policies within our facility, enable us to prevent the occurance, minimize the consequenses of significant releases of ammonia, as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents. Additionally, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and ilnesses, and avoid physical property damage.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical that is over the threshold quantity. Other hazardous materials are in-house, but in quantities below their threshold levels. Regardless, accepted industry safety practices, such as MSDS sheets, proper storage, personal protective equipment, etc., are used religiously. These products are typical of what one would find in a maintenance shop servicing a building or related fork truck type equipment.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system consists of compressors, vessels, condensers, evaporators,piping and pumps, and are i"
