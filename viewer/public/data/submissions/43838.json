BP Solvay has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the La Porte, Texas polyethylene plant.  The plant's program complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a RMP Plan summary describing the risk management program at BP Solvay.  This plan is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.150 though 40 CFR 68.185) and to provide the public with a description of the RMP in place at Innovene.\n\n2.0   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBP Solvay is committed to the safety of their employees, the public and to the preservation of the environment and has a program in place to prevent releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, Innovene emergency response actions are in place to help prevent or minimize injury to the public or the environment.\n\n3.0   Facility Process and Regulated Substances\nInnovene manufactures polyethylene resins for a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications such as plastic milk bottles, pipes, and cups.\n  \nThe polyethylene manufacturing process uses ethylene as the basic building block for producing polyethylene.  Isobutane is used as a carrier solvent for the polyethylene process.  Propane is inherent to the polyethylene manufacturing processes.  \n\n4.0   Offsite Consequence Analysis\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on the polyethylene facility.  The subject analysis consisted of worst-case scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s)."

Checklists include items to help ensure that BP Solvay operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n5.3   Operating Procedures \nInnovene operating procedures are maintained under an ISO9000 program.  As such we are required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) train employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n5.4   Training \nInnovene trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided, as necessary.\n\n5.5   Maintenance \nInnovene properly maintains the process equipment.  The maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\n\n5.6   Management of Change \nInnovene has a program in place to document changes to facility processes.  A significant change in process chemicals, technology, equipment, practices or procedures prompt implementation of this program.  The program is designed to (1) evaluate the impact of the change on the process, (2) update records on the process and (3) ensure that workers are informed and trained on any significant changes.\n\n5.7   Pre-startup Review \nInnovene performs audits on a new process or an existing process that has undergone a modification affecting the safety information.  This review is done prior to"

      "SummaryText": "There is no toxic RMP compounds at the polyethylene facility; therefore, toxic worst-case and toxic alternative scenarios were not considered.\n \nOne worst-case scenario was completed for all flammable RMP compounds. The scenario is a release of 636,000 pounds of isobutane from two twin isobutane storage tanks and associated piping, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The pressure effects from this scenario would reach the offsite industrial endpoints but it would not reach residential populations.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is considered a conservative analysis.  It is based worst-case meteorological conditions proposed by RMP guidance.  In addition, the worst-case scenario did not consider (credit) any existing safety systems or mitigation activities.  \n\nTwo Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were completed for flammable RMP compounds.  The first is a release of ethylene from a metering yard header resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The second is a BLEVE of a polyethylene reactor containing 58,000 pounds of isobutane.  The pressure / thermal effects from these scenarios may reach offsite industrial endpoints but not residential populations.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios are based on more typical atmospheric conditions. \n\n5.0   Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe polyethylene processes are currently covered by the PSM standard.  As such, a Program Level 3 prevention program is in place.  The following paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at Innovene.\n\n5.1   Safety Information \nInnovene maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the polyethylene processes.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of all hazardous substances handled at the plant.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to applicable codes and"

The review (1) confirms proper equipment was used, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are updated, (3) a hazard evaluation has been conducted, and (4) training has been updated.\n\n5.8   Compliance Audits\nInnovene performs periodic compliance audits of the covered process to verify that the process is operating in compliance with the Process Safety Management standard.  Compliance audit reports are prepared after each audit, with documented deficiencies and corrections.\n\n5.9   Incident Investigations\nInnovene investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  Innovene procedures require an investigation team to be assembled, and the investigation to be initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n5.10   Employee Participation\nInnovene requires participation by the affected employees in development (1) of the process hazard evaluation, (2) process safety management, and (3) operating procedures of all covered processes.  The employees that work with or maintain the processes are given access to all information required under the rule.\n\n5.11   Hot Work Permits\nInnovene has written safety practices in place for fire protection and process operation.  A permitting system is used to prevent any unsafe acts on or around the covered process.\n\n5.12   Contractors\nInnovene reviews all contractors prior to working on or near a covered process.  The contractor must submit information that indicates the work can be performed competently and safely.  The company will provide information on the hazards of the process and the safety practices in place.  Documents are kept to confirm that the information was received and understood.

In addition, several equipment safeguards are in place.  Examples of such safeguards include: hydrocarbon detection and water deluge systems, related piping and vessel periodic inspection and maintenance, and continuous process monitoring for operations involving RMP listed compounds.\n  \n6.0   Five-Year Accident History\nInnovene Polyethylene maintains a 5-year accident history that fulfills the requirements of the RMP rule (\u00a768.42).  This history indicates a good record of accidental release prevention.  No releases of regulated substances above threshold quantity have occurred from Innovene during the subject five year period that have resulted in consequences of interest (i.e., deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site).\n\n7.0 Emergency Response Program\nInnovene has established a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plan regulations.  This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local police and fire departments.  Regular dialogue is maintained between the facility and the local response personnel, and the company provides appropriate information to the fire chief.  Innovene periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local response authorities.\n \n8.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nPlanned changes to improve safety are described in Innovene Process Hazard Analyses, plant alterations, projects, and the Site Safety, Health & Security Plan."
