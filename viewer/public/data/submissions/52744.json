The regulated substances under the RMP program are anhydrous ammonia and denaturant (natural gasoline). Ethanol Grain Processors, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 2.6 miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be 0.8 miles; due to the amount of each substance stored on site.\n\nOff-site Consequences Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all 18,000 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud. The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site. The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 2.6 miles from the center of the ammonia tank.
