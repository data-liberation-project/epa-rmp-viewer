Since the previous submittal a charge calculation was performed resulting in a total capacity of 30,821 pounds. With the facility expansion, an additional 5,270 pounds of ammonia will be added. The new maximum capacity for the system is 36,091 pounds.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nGSC Wholesale, LLC is committed to the safety of its employees and neighbors and operates the Facility as a responsible member of the community. Personnel are encouraged to continually identify methods and procedures to reduce the use of and risks associated with hazardous chemicals. This process includes protecting the community, environment, and Facility personnel by implementing technology and procedures designed to reduce the impact of any potential release of toxic chemicals. This commitment to safety is documented in the policy and compliance manuals for the Facility, which are available to all employees.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substance\r\n\r\nGSC Wholesale, LLC utilizes anhydrous ammonia within a refrigeration system at the Facility. The facility uses approximately 36,091 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nOff-site Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nGSC Wholesale, LLC has conducted an OCA based on the EPA document titled \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines,\" and used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07 to estimate the distance traveled to a toxic endpoint defined by the EPA regulation. This data were then used to estimate the potential impact caused by a release from each of the regulated substances.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAs required by regulations, scenarios were considered where the entire capacity of the largest vessel for each regulated chemical at the facility was released in 10 minutes. Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies with a maximum possible impact in"

Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP, elements of the prevention programs have been developed to manage process safety issues associated with the facility. Each of the program elements has been developed according to OSHA and EPA regulations in order to ensure safe operating practices and conditions at the GSC Wholesale, LLC facility.\r\nElements of Prevention Program 3 include the following:\r\n- Process Safety Information - information regarding the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process description, and equipment properties\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis - a detailed review of the process, and recommendations to improve the safety of the systems at the Facility\r\n- Operating Procedures - procedures designed to comply with regulations and provide safe practices for the systems at the Facility\r\n- Training - procedures and logs for personnel training on the covered process\r\n- Mechanical Integrity - manufacturer recommended maintenance procedures, schedules, an"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\r\n\r\nProcess Description \r\n\r\nFrom the High Pressure Receiver (HPR-1), liquid make-up ammonia is supplied to the Intercooler (INT-1) and the High Temperature Recirculators 1 (HTR-1) & 2 (HTR-2).  The HPR-1 also supplies refrigeration ammonia to the Cooler Evaporator AU-31 surge drum. The HTR-1 supplies liquid make-up to the Low Temperature Recirculator 1 (LTR-1) and Low Temperature Recirculator 2 (LTR-2). As part of the high stage system, the HTR-1  pumps liquid ammonia to the Dock and Cooler evaporators (AU-7 through AU-30, AU-32 through AU-38, AU-52 through AU-55) and the Dual Temperature evaporators (AU-43 through AU-51"

As part of the low stage system, LTR-1 pumps liquid ammonia to the Freezer evaporators (AU-1 through AU-6, and AU-39 through AU-42) and the Dual Temperature evaporators (AU-43 through AU-51, and AU-58 through AU-60 if set up for low temp) and LTR-2 in turn pumps liquid to evaporators (AU-56, AU-57, AU-61 and AU-62).  \r\n\r\nAt each evaporator, the liquid ammonia expands across a thermal expansion valve or a hand expansion valve.  The pressure of the liquid drops as it expands, causing the ammonia temperature to drop.  The low-pressure ammonia liquid then flows across heat exchanger surfaces (air unit coils) where it picks up heat, changing from a liquid to a vapor.  The ammonia vapor mix is then sent back via overhead vapor lines to the appropriate suction vessel, which supplies liquid to the evaporator (the INT-1, the HTR-1, the HTR-2 the LTR-1 or the LTR-2).\r\n\r\nAmmonia vapors from LTR-1 and LTR-2 are drawn off by the low stage screw compressors (RB-1 through   RB-4) and discharged as higher pressure vapor into the Intercooler (INT-1).   Ammonia vapors from the INT-1 and HTR-1 are drawn off by the high stage screw compressors (RC-2 through RC-5) and discharged at high pressure to the evaporative condensers (EC-1 through EC-6).   The high stage screw compressors (RC-6 & RC-7) draw suction off the HTR-2 and are protected by a surge drum (SD-1) to prevent liquid slugging. These two high stage compressors also discharge to the evaporative condensers (EC-1 through EC-6).  The hot ammonia gas passes to the six (6) evaporative condensers where ammonia is condensed into liquid.\r\n\r\nAfter the ammonia has been liquefied in the condensers, it flows by gravity down to the Thermosyphon Vessel, and then in"

The other high stage compressors (RC-2, RC-6 & RC-7), and the low stage compressors receive liquid injection oil cooling from the TSV-1.\r\n\r\nThe system is also equipped with a glycol heat exchanger / chiller (HX-1) used in the process of ripening bananas. The chiller is fed high temperature recirculated liquid from HTR-2 and returns high temperature recirculated suction to the same vessel to chill glycol for use in the ripening process. \r\nAny non-condensables in the vapor streams will be removed periodically by an automatic gas Purger.  The gas Purger separates ammonia from the non-condensibles by condensing the ammonia. The non-condensibles are piped to a water bubbler to remove any trace quantities of ammonia. The system is equipped with a water diffusion tank to which the pressure relief valves throughout the system are commonly piped to protect the system from an overpressure situation.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nC&S has developed an Ammonia Emergency Action Plan (Refrigeration Emergency Response Plan) which includes but is not limited to the following:\r\n- emergency response and evacuation procedures\r\n- safety and health considerations\r\n- notification procedures\r\n- local emergency response agencies\r\n- environmental offsite consequences\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes\r\n\r\nChanges determined by the most recent PHA and considerations made during the development of this plan will be conducted in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nUpdates\r\n\r\nThe RMP for the Facility will be updated at least every five years, and, with this anniversary reset is next due to be updated in December 2020."
