Emulsion products are used in latex paint, floor polishes, adhesives, inks, coatings and binders for paper products, as well as caulking, cement and concrete.\nA?    Acrylic coatings are noted for their toughness and shine.  Acrylic coatings provide the finish for boats and the touch-up paint for cars.  The coatings also beautify and protect signs and steel.  They are used on metal furniture, the painted part of pencils, and the lining of soft drink cans.\n\nRohm and Haas Louisville produces approximately one billion pounds of product annually, has 257 employees with annual payroll and benefits of $38 million, and pays approximately $0.9 million annually in taxes (not including income tax).  Rohm and Haas contributes to many charitable organizations in the community. \n\n3.0    The EPAA?s Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air Act &#61479; 112(r).  The RMP contains a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical may be subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate A?worst caseA? and A?alternate caseA? scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to the public.  This document is part of Rohm and Haas LouisvilleA?s RMP communication effort.  \n\n4.0    Regulated Substances\n\nOur plant uses three chemicals which are regulated by the RMP: \nA?    1,3-butadiene monomer, an RMP flammable used in the production of plastic modifiers, \n\nA?

These audits review accident prevention activities to ensure the requirements of the programs are being met. \n\n7.0    Five Year Accident History\n\nThe RMP rule requires each company to include a description of all accidental releases from covered processes that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  The Rohm and Haas Louisville plant had no events meeting this criteria during the last five years.\n\n8.0    Emergency Response Program \n\nThe Rohm and Haas Louisville plant has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Lake Dreamland Fire Department, Rubbertown Mutual Aid Association, and other local response agencies. New employees are trained prior to working in a process area and plant personnel review the plan during annual safety meetings.  The plant has an extensive alarm system, which includes key alarms also sounding in the plant gate house. Most processes have remote shutdown capability, including those covered by RMP.  The plant has an on-site state-recognized fire department, with mobile fire protection vehicles as well as state-licensed ambulance service.  The siteA?s 24-hour emergency response team can respond to both on-site and transportation off-site hazardous materials releases. The site has direct radio contact with off-site responders and the ability to activate the community siren system.

Based on previous history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, these worse-case scenarios are highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternate release scenario (ARS). Unlike worse-case scenarios, the ARS can be limited by active mitigation safeguards, such as alarms, automatic shutdowns, and operator interventions.   According to EPA, an ARS is a more useful communication tool for the public and first responders and for emergency response preparedness and planning. \n\nWorst Case Scenarios:  \nRohm and Haas Louisville has identified two WCS based on the RMP definition: one for a toxic material and one for a flammable material.  The following is a description of our scenarios:\n\nWorst Case Toxic\nThis scenario involves acrylonitrile, which is considered a toxic material under the RMP rule.   It assumes the loss of the entire inventory of 275,000 pound from a catastrophic failure of the storage tank into the containment dike, releasing vapors over a 60 minute period.  The EPAA?s tabulated dispersion predictions were used to determine the toxic endpoint of this release and such a release could have a significant off-site impact.  Because of the plant controls, procedures and training, the worse case event is extremely unlikely. \n\nWorst Case Flammable  \nThis scenario involves releasing the maximum inventory of 1,3-butadiene from the storage tank.  Administrative procedures, controls and alarms limit the maximum inventory to 600,000 pounds.  1,3-butadiene is a flammable substance under the RMP rule.  The RMP rule assumes the entire vessel contents would be released, ignited, and results in a vapor cloud explosion.  We have applied EPAA?s guidance and predicted endpoint distances to a one psi overpressure.  A vapor cloud expl"

There are prevention and mitigation equipment and systems in place to minimize this possibility. Trained operators are assigned to the storage area.  The 1,3 butadiene tanks are covered by the process safety management program and undergo integrity testing and inspections on a routine basis.  The area is constantly monitored with gas detectors.  Temperature detectors are tied into a water deluge system surrounding the storage tank. Because of the plant controls, procedures and training, the worse case event is extremely unlikely.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nRohm and Haas Louisville has identified three ARS: one for each toxic material (2) and one for butadiene, the flammable material.  These scenarios were chosen after reviewing process hazard analysis, the plant spill history, and discussing alternatives with knowledgeable and experienced unit personnel.  The scenarios we have identified are more credible than those described in the worst case, but are still very unlikely given of the multiple levels of protection and extensive employee training.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - Acrylonitrile (Toxic Liquid)\nThe RMP rule requires an alternate release scenario be picked for each covered toxic material. The following is the alternate scenario description for acrylonitrile:\nBeyond the storage tank containment area, the transfer line to the production unit is welded without gasketed flanges or drains.  However if a A? inch drain valve on the transfer line within the containment dike were left open, the entire contents of the transfer line would be drained and 1,000 pounds of acrylonitrile would be released into the containment dike.  Gas detectors would sound an alarm in the control room and automatically close the tank bottom valve.

Ammonia (30% in water)  (Toxic Liquid)\nThe following is the alternate release scenario description for aqueous ammonia:\nIf the transfer line from the aqueous ammonia storage tank failed (e.g. leaking gasket flange) outside of the storage tank containment dike and the transfer pump stayed on for 10 minutes, 4,500 pounds of aqueous ammonia would be released. The EPAA?s tabulated dispersion predictions for alternate release scenarios was used to determine the toxic endpoint.  This release could effect plant employees, if any were in the path of the wind in this remote section of the plant.  A small area of the plant to the north could be affected, depending on the weather conditions and the wind direction.  There are no residences or environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint circle.  Rupture of the transfer line is unlikely because of its design strength and the protection that the elevated pipe support route and structure strength provide.  In addition, plant personnel would be quickly alerted by the recognizable odor and stop the release before ten minutes had elapsed.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario A? 1,3-Butadiene (Flammable refrigerated gas)\nThe following is the alternate scenario description for 1,3-butadiene:\nIf the three-inch transfer line from the storage tank to the production building failed outside of the storage area containment dike, the entire contents of the transfer line from storage to the production unit, 5,200 pounds, would be released.

There are no residences or environmental receptors within this toxic endpoint circle.  However, rupture of the transfer line is unlikely because of its strength and the protection that the pipe support route and structure strength provide.\n\n10.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe plant focus on safety is strong throughout the Rohm and Haas Company, which was recently acquired by the Dow Chemical Company.  Rohm and Haas continuously looks for ways to reduce risks and to improve safety performance.  Our safety program is integrated into all parts of plant operation and involves the identification and implementation of ways to improve safety performance.  For example, the plant switched from ammonia gas to aqueous ammonia (30% ammonia in water) in the late 1980A?s in order to reduce risk.  Also, the plant has achieved OSHAA?s Voluntary Protection Program certification.  The plant continues to identify and implement other safety improvement opportunities.\n"
