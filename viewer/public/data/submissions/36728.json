Our goal is to prevent problems, through the use of our preventive maintenance program that we enforce. The purpose is to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions and make necessary modifications before problems develop. Our on going program is designed to maintain the integrity of the system and assure that all employees are properly trained and meet the requirements to operate our equipment within the boundaries of our PSM/RMP program.\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNestle Solon Plant produces and packages frozen prepared foods. The facility uses ammonia in its refrigeration system as a heat transfer medium. Ammonia is supplied to various end users in the processing of frozen foods.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Solon Plant.\n\nDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, EPA's Risk Management Program Regulations. The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n? Employee Participation\n? Process Safety Information\n? Process Hazard Analysis\n? Operating Procedures\n? Training Programs\n? Mechanical Integrity Program\n? Hot Work Permit Procedure\n? Management of Change Procedures\n? Incident Investigation\n? Compliance Audit Procedure\n? Pre-Startup Safety Proced"

Approximately 32 pounds of ammonia were released during a maintenance activity.  Maintenance procedures, training procedures, and operating procedures were modified as a result of this incident.\n \n \n Description of the Emergency Response Program\n \n An emergency response program has been implemented at the Solon Plant. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures for the plant and hi-rise freezer.\n \n \n The emergency response program includes the following elements:\n \n? Ammonia Leak Procedures \n? Emergency Evacuation Plan (Plant)\n? Fire Plan\n? Emergency Response Team Responsibilities\n? High-Rise Evacuation Plan\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nNumerous changes were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the ammonia system was analyzed in 2004. The recommended changes will be evaluated and implemented as necessary."
