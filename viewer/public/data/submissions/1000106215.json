The emergency response program\n\nEmergency response is discussed in the Risk Management Program (RMP) binder of the complete program. Demakes has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous\nammonia. The Demakes facility will conduct scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on\nemergency health care.\n\n7.

Refresher training and emergency\nresponse drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the Demakes facility is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of  Demakes Enterprises's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, the Demakes facility is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n2.
