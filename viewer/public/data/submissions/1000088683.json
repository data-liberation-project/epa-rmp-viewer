The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38. The programs consist of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires and/or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive periodic training in these procedures to perform emergency response duties. The program receives periodic reviews and is updated as necessary for modifications made to the facility or practices.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the facility is coordinated with the Local Emergency\r\nPlanning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The facility offers the local fire department and other emergency response organizations the opportunity to participate in periodic emergency response drills.\r\n\r\nFacility personnel notify local agencies when emergency response assistance is needed. Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified. If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the facility plans to implement additional engineering safeguards. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the process"
