We recognize that activities at this facility may impact our employees and the surrounding community. Because of this, Club Chef Southeast is dedicated to environmental protection, employee health and safety, regulatory compliance and pollution prevention through a strategy of continual improvement and teamwork.\n\n\n\nOur company environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this facility, our employees, and the public. This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. Club Chef Southeast is committed to complying with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations,\n\n\n\nTitle 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. These programs enable the facility to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nIt is Club Chef Southeast's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment. Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Club Chef Southeast is located at 4322 Moreland Ave, Conley, GA 30288 utilizes an anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) refrigeration system to maintain proper storage temperatures for various food and produce items.

As the total amount of ammonia within the system is greater than 10,000 pounds the system is subject to PSM and RMP.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations. The PSM program comprises the prevention program elements. The facility PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire ammonia refrigeration system process. The approach addresses the process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that affect the process. Specific Prevention Steps include the following:\n\n\n\nProcess hazard analysis and review, including corrective action follow-up requirements;\n\nStandard operating procedures that all operators of the refrigeration system must follow;\n\nFormal operator training;\n\nPreventative maintenance to ensure that the entire refrigeration system is mechanically sound;\n\nProcedures to ensure that changes to the refrigeration system are managed so ammonia flow remains safe;\n\nSafety review prior to the startup of new or modified equipment;\n\nAudits of the PSM and RMP programs;\n\nIncident investigations to ensure that lessons are learned to prevent future incidents;\n\nEmployee involvement in risk reduction programs;\n\nContractor safety procedures are reviewed to ensure outside workers exercise the same safety consciousness as facility employees;\n\nA work permit system that ensures all welding / hot work is conducted safely.\n\nProcess safety information; and\n\nEmergency planning and response.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has not had a release of a regulated substance that has"

The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38. The programs consist of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires and/or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive periodic training in these procedures to perform emergency response duties. The program receives periodic reviews and is updated as necessary for modifications made to the facility or practices.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the facility is coordinated with the Local Emergency\n\nPlanning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The facility offers the local fire department and other emergency response organizations the opportunity to participate in periodic emergency response drills.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel notify local agencies when emergency response assistance is needed. Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified. If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the facility plans to implement additional engineering safeguards. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the process\n\n"
