      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction\n\nSiemens Power Corporation (SPC) owns and operates a nuclear fuel fabrication facility located at 2101 Horn Rapids Road, just inside the northern boundary of the City of Richland.  The plant produces nuclear fuel bundle assemblies for light water reactors of both boiling water and pressurized water designs.  Intermediate fuel products, i.e. uranium dioxide powder and uranium dioxide fuel pellets, are also produced for use by other nuclear fuel fabricators.\n\nRegulatory Environment\n\nThe SPC plant is licensed as a major materials licensee by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under their regulations in 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 70.  The basis for this NRC license (Special Nuclear Materials License No. SNM-1227), which SPC (and prior plant owners) have held since 1970, is the plant's possession and processing of special nuclear material in the form of low enriched uranium (less than 5% enriched in the uranium isotope U-235).  The NRC license is very comprehensive in scope and prescriptive in nature.  Via license conditions it regulates the health, safety, and environmental aspects of all of the plant's facilities, processes, and activities that deal with special nuclear material (SNM), which encompass the majority of all activities conducted on the site.  The NRC assesses SPC's compliance with the terms of its license via an inspection program emanating both from NRC headquarters in Washington D.C. and NRC's applicable regional office located in Arlington, Texas.  Under this consolidated inspection program, SPC receives approximately ten onsite inspections per year covering SPC's major environmental, safety, and health programs, e.g. radiological safety, criticality safety, environmental protection, waste management, chemical safety, emergency preparedness, security, SNM accountability, fire protection, training, and management controls.\n\nNext to the NRC, SPC's most significant regulator is the Washington State D"

These mixed wastes, plus a smaller number of chemical but non-radioactive wastes, are regulated under Ecology's Dangerous Waste Regulations in WAC 173-303.  The SPC plant also sewers certain of its treated liquid effluents under the terms of a state waste discharge permit administered under Ecology's water quality regulations.  The permit limits the volume of SPC's liquid effluent as well as the amounts of key chemical constituents present in the effluent.  Both Ecology regulatory programs involve routine reporting requirements and periodic onsite inspections by Ecology staff.\n\nSPC's possession/utilization of radionuclides other than enriched uranium is regulated by the Washington State Department of Health (WDOH) via a State Radioactive Materials License.  This primarily impacts a small service organization within SPC that performs service work at nuclear reactor sites.  The State Radioactive Materials License also regulates SPC's usage of sealed radiation sources of a sort contained in measuring, testing, and calibration equipment.  WDOH also provides regulatory oversight over airborne emissions from radioactive material processing systems.  Compliance with WDOH regulations/licenses is confirmed via periodic onsite inspections by WDOH personnel.\nThe industrial health and safety aspects of SPC's activities are regulated under Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) regulations in WAC 296-24 (General Safety and Health Standards), WAC 296-62 (General Occupational Health Standards) and, as applicable, WAC 296-155 (Safety Standards for Construction Work).

The Clean Air Authority regulates SPC's airborne emission sources, primarily via their source registration/permit program.  The City regulates SPC's sewer discharges via their sewer pre-treatment regulations.\n\nSPC Regulatory Compliance and Environmental Protection Policies\n\nSPC Policy Guide 10.1 states that it is the policy of SPC \"to conduct its operations such that they will not be detrimental to its employees, the public, or the environment.\"  This involves compliance with the \"conditions of all applicable licenses, permits, and regulations;\" in addition, \"appropriate regard will be given to regulatory guides and industry standards.\"  Policy Guide 10.1 assigns ultimate responsibility for adherence to this policy to the Senior Vice President and General Manager, SPC.\n\nSPC Policy Guide 10.4 deals specifically with compliance with environmental laws, requiring that \"all of its operations shall be in full compliance with Federal and State environmental laws and regulations and local ordinances.\"  Furthermore, the policy states that \"it shall be the preferred position that process and equipment designs and operations take into account and mitigate any potential adverse impact on the environs from any hazardous matter generated or used by SPC-ND such that the requirement for administrative controls is minimized.\"\n\nKey to understanding the Richland fuel fabrication facilities approach to environmental compliance is that it is not the sole responsibility of the \"environmental compliance staff.\"  SPC Policy Guide 10.4 states clearly that the Senior Vice President and General Manager of SPC has the \"ultimate responsibility for compliance with environmental laws and for assuring that adequate resources are available to support compliance.\"  On a day-to-day basis, environmental compliance is a"

Environmental compliance, therefore, is a line management function distributed throughout the facility.\n\nSPC Organizational Responsibilities for Accident Prevention/Environmental Compliance\n\nAs discussed above, SPC's accident prevention and environmental protection programs stem from a top-level policy of compliance with all applicable health, safety, and environmental regulations and the clear assignment of line management responsibilities to assure that compliance is achieved.  From a practical standpoint, SPC has established a management organization/structure to implement its compliance initiatives.  Individual organizations conduct their activities, including their compliance-related activities, via established policies, procedures, and other formal written guidance.\n\nVirtually all of the activities conducted onsite at SPC's Richland facility that pose potentially significant operational health, safety, or environmental risks are conducted within the Manufacturing Division, headed by the Vice President, Manufacturing.  Within the Manufacturing Division, the Safety, Security, and Licensing (SS&L) Department includes the Regulatory Compliance Section, responsible for review of regulations for potential applicability to SPC, dissemination of regulatory requirements to affected organizations, and assessment of regulatory compliance status.

These include staff responsible for SPC's criticality safety, health physics, radiological protection, industrial safety, emergency preparedness, and fire protection programs.\n\nSS&L staff incorporate health, safety, and environmental requirements from applicable regulations, licenses, and permits into internal safety standards.  The top level document for these internal standards is EMF-30, the SPC Safety Manual.  EMF-30 is organized into six chapters as follows: Chapter 1, Industrial Safety Standards; Chapter 2, Radiological Safety Standards; Chapter 3, Criticality Safety Standards; Chapter 4, Environmental Safety Standards; Chapter 5, Radioactive Material Shipping Standards; and Chapter 6, Industrial Hygiene Safety Standards.  Requirements for lower tier safety-related documentation, e.g. criticality safety analyses, radiation work procedures, etc. are generally defined in EMF-30 safety standards.  EMF-32, SPC Emergency Plan and Procedures, is also maintained by SS&L and constitutes the top tier document that defines and governs SPC's overall emergency preparedness and emergency response program.  SS&L's program of environmental, safety, and health audits and inspections is set forth in EMF-1733, Richland Fuel Manufacturing Administrative Procedures.  This internal audit/inspection program currently establishes a total of 42 distinct audits and inspections, with frequencies ranging from monthly to triennially.\n\nThe second department within the Manufacturing Division with a major role in SPC's accident prevention/environmental compliance effort is the Manufacturing Engineering Department.

Finished fuel assemblies (bundles) are supplied to nuclear utilities for direct usage as fuel in their nuclear power reactors, however intermediate products such as enriched uranium powder or pellets are also produced in behalf of other nuclear fuel cycle facilities.\n\nThe typical feed material to the plant is uranium hexafluoride (UF6) received in 30-inch diameter steel cylinders, each containing approximately 1500 kilograms of enriched uranium.  The UF6 is chemically converted to uranium dioxide (UO2) powder, which is pressed into fuel pellets, which in turn are subsequently loaded into fuel rods.  These loaded fuel rods, in conjunction with other supporting hardware (tie plates and grid spacers), are assembled into a variety of fuel bundle designs, depending on the customer-specific requirements.\n\nThe chemical conversion technology utilized at SPC for the UF6 to UO2 conversion relies on a \"dry\" conversion process that accomplishes the UF6 to UO2 conversion in a single-stage, vapor-phase reactor.  The dry conversion process produces a comparatively small volume liquid waste stream, with nearly all of the fluorides in the reactor offgas stream being condensed to produce a marketable hydrofluoric acid (HF) byproduct.  This technology is housed in the new Dry Conversion Facility (DCF) that was brought on-line over 1997/1998.  \n\nProduction"

The ADU process produces relatively large quantities of ammonia - and fluoride - containing liquid wastes that are processed for ammonia and uranium recovery in separate wastewater treatment facilities.  The dry conversion process has replaced the ADU process for all UF6 to UO2 conversion; use of the ADU process is now limited to the wet recycle of off-specification or impure (\"dirty\") UO2 powder or pellets (\"uranium scrap\").  This recent transition from the ADU process to dry conversion as SPC's primary chemical conversion technology has markedly reduced the amount of liquid and solid wastes produced from these activities.\n\nThe primary fuel production and support activities occur onsite at a number of key facilities.  The most significant of those facilities are as follows:\n\nDry Conversion Facility - This major operating facility houses three parallel conversion lines which utilize the dry conversion technology to convert UF6 to UO2.  UO2 powder produced in the Dry Conversion Facility is transferred to the UO2 Building for subsequent processing steps (pellet pressing, grinding, rod loading, bundle assembly).  Alternatively, dry conversion powder may be transferred to the Specialty Fuels Building for incorporation into neutron absorber fuel.  The Dry Conversion Facility also includes equipment for the recovery of fluorides (as hydrofluoric acid) from the dry conversion offgas stream.  The acid is temporarily stored in sample tanks in the facility before being transferred to large outdoor storage tanks.  The recovered hydrofluoric acid is ultimately sold as a commercial chemical product.\n\nUranium Dioxide (UO2) Building - This major operating facility houses the ADU conversion line, pelletizing, pellet sintering, rod loading, and bundle assembly.

After blending UO2 powder (received from the Dry Conversion Facility or UO2 Building) with gadolinia (an oxide of gadolinium), processing proceeds much the same as in the UO2 Building (powder preparation, pelletizing, etc.).  The SF Building also houses the Solid Waste Uranium Recovery (SWUR) Facility, where uranium is thermally recovered from non-dangerous, uranium-containing combustible wastes.\n\nEngineering Laboratory Operations (ELO) Building - The ELO Building is a combination facility housing production, engineering testing/development, laboratory, and office activities.  The production process is the Gadolinium Scrap Uranium Recovery (GSUR) process used to remove gadolinia and other impurities from various uranium feed streams to produce uranyl nitrate solution for subsequent conversion to UO2 via the ADU process in the UO2 Bldg.  Since GSUR is a solvent extraction process, the facility is also often referred to as the Solvent Extraction, or SX, Facility.\n\nMachine Shop - The Machine Shop fabricates rod end caps, spacers, and tie plates used as component hardware in the fabrication of fuel bundles.  Once fabricated, these stainless steel and zircaloy components are chemically treated in the Component Etch Facility.  The Machine Shop also performs traditional machining services in support of plant operations.\n\nAmmonia Recovery Facility (ARF) - The ARF is a key waste management facility which provides several recycling/treatment functions relative to SPC's liquid effluent streams.

The LUR product is further processed in other onsite production processes, with the recovered uranium being eventually used for fuel pellet production.\n\nSolids Processing Facility (SPF) - The SPF is a companion facility to LUR and is used to recover uranium from solids in SPC's surface impoundment system.

It is piped to one of four ammonia dissociators where it is catalytically cracked into hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2) gases.  The H2/N2 mixture is utilized as a cover gas in several plant processes, including the dry conversion reactors, the powder calciners, and the pellet sintering furnaces.\n\nAmmonium Hydroxide >20%\n\nAmmonium hydroxide >20% (at SPC, not exceeding approximately 23%) is stored in one 28,000 gallon tank and two 10,000 gallon tanks.

ARF, via caustic addition and subsequent steam stripping in a distillation column, recovers ammonium hydroxide and returns it to tank storage.  ARF is also recovering ammonium hydroxide from liquids that have been in long term storage in SPC's surface impoundment system.  This recovered ammonium hydroxide is also returned to tank storage.  Since SPC's ammonium hydroxide recovery efforts are producing more ammonium hydroxide than is needed in the ADU conversion process, SPC sells excess ammonium hydroxide for use as an agricultural fertilizer.\n\nPropane\n\nPropane is stored onsite in 1000 gallon tanks.  The four interconnected tanks on the east side of the UO2 Building supply flame curtains used to burn off any hydrogen gas escaping from the ends of the pellet sintering furnaces.  Propane from these tanks is also utilized to fill fork lift trucks.

The 28,000 gallons will overflow into the 10,000 gallon tank containment area but before overflowing that basin, the liquid overflows back to the basin surrounding the 28,000 gallon tank via a line that connects the two basins.  The spill is contained in the two basins with a surface area of 2,551 ft2.  The endpoint for this scenario is 0.81 miles and no residential population is within that distance.  This scenario is not likely to happen because the filling is started manually (if the small tank were full, overflow would be detected), then monitored by computer in a control room.  There is also a high level shutoff at 9,000 gallons.  It would take ~1.5 hours to fill the small basin and for overflow into the large basin to begin.

      "SummaryText": "mmediate notification and PAR's to all neighbors within one mile of the site plus local county, state and federal agencies per SPC's Emergency Plan requirements.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSPC has extensively evaluated the safety of its anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide systems during the conduct of the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program hazards analyses for these systems.  Safety enhancements identified via these efforts are pursued as appropriate.  As previously noted, SPC's emergency preparedness program involves training drills with state, county, and local emergency agencies which include response to and mitigation of potential accidents with these chemicals.  Critiques from the training drills are used to improve training, response coordination with agencies, public notification, and the overall effectiveness of all aspects of the emergency response program."
