EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThe ISP Freetown Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Freetown Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates (SOCMA), ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Freetown Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage risk at ISP Freetown and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management program at the Freetown Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of that Risk Management Program. \n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response policies\n\nThe ISP Freetown Plant is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will take appropriate action to minimize the effects of the release and, if necessary, contacts the local fire departments to assist in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.\n\nISP Freetown's Site General Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation"

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on an organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM), accident prevention program, RMP hazard assessment and Risk Management Plan has been delegated jointly to the Environmental Manager and the Health/Safety/Security Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n1.2\tISP's Freetown Plant Regulated Substances\n\nThe ISP Freetown Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility situated on three contiguous parcels totaling approximately 130 acres, located on the Freetown-Fall River town boundary.  The plant is within the city limits of Freetown, MA, about one half mile west of Route 24 and 5 miles north of Interstate 195.  The site is bounded by the Taunton River and Barnaby's Cove, the Riverfront Business Park, South Main Street, the Freetown-Fall River State Forest, and a residential housing development.\n\nThe ISP Freetown Plant makes a variety of products.  One of the feed chemicals that is used at ISP Freetown is Vinyl Acetate (VA).  VA is a toxic and flammable substance that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule as a toxic substance and is present in one of our processes above the specified EPA threshold quantity of 15,000 lbs.\n\n1.3\tAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ISP Freetown Plant.  Because Vinyl Acetate, which is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation, is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) reg"

The PSM program at this facility has been extended, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n1.3.1\tEmployee participation\n\nISP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and incident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and plant and process inspection teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the site incident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  This plan is reviewed for accuracy and updates every three years.  In addition, the Freetown Plant has a number of initiatives underway that addresses process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include safety walkthroughs, housekeeping inspections, and a site safety committee, typically comprised of members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n1.3.2\tProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Freetown Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known safety concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in their product/process operating procedures.  The Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls, monitoring instruments, and highly trained personnel.\n\nThe Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n1.3.3\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Freetown Plant has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.  \n\nThe Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The Plant also utilizes the What-if/Checklist Analysis technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention"

Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  ISP utilizes a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) method to guide in prioritization of these improvements.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Plant periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n1.3.4\tOperating Procedures\n\nThe Freetown Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n(1) unit startup\n(2) normal operations\n(3) temporary operations\n(4) emergency shutdown\n(5) normal shutdown.\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.

New employees receive basic training on site operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n1.3.6\tContractors\n\nThe Freetown Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n(1) perform their work in a safe manner, \n(2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, \n(3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \n(4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, \n(5) understand and follow site safety rules, and \n(6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n\n(1) information about safety and health hazards, \n(2) emergency response plan requirements, and \n(3) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\n\nThe Plant maintains a Contractor Safety Program, which specifically addresses contractor safe work practices and is"

The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n1.3.8\tMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Freetown Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain storage tanks, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

      "SummaryText": "r.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, management will correct the deficiency, in a timely manner, or management of change (MOC) will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Freetown Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n1.3.9\tSafe Work Practices\n\nISP Freetown has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:\n\n(1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel\n(2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance,\n(3)  a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, \n(4)  a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and \n(5)  a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n1.3.10\tManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nThe Freetown Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed a"

Changes are reviewed to:\n(1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  The Plant maintains a documented Management of Change procedure, which ensures that all changes to plant processes and operating procedures are reviewed and implemented to prevent work hazards.  This procedure is reviewed for accuracy and updates every three years.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\n1.3.11\tIncident Investigation\n\nISP promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted .in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The Plant maintains a written Incident Reporting & Investigation program, which specifically addresses reporting of incidents, incident investigations, and the use of a Tracking & Management System, to help manage post accident activities.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to site management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAAs and PHA revalidation"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n1.4\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Freetown Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the EPA RMP-covered process at the site.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities listed above, the Freetown Plant has safety features on many units to help quickly detect a release, contain/control a release, and reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n   Release Detection \n* Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in selected areas \n\n   Release Containment/Control \n* Process relief valves prevent overpressure damage to equipment \n* Manual and automatic valves to permit isolation of the process \n* Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level)\n* Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases \n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where needed (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, redundant fire water pumps) \n* Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \n* Trained emergency response personnel \n* Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained brea"
