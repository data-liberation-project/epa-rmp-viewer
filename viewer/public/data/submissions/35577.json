Blytheville facility was previously operated as a manufacturer of nitrogenous fertilizers. On May 27, 2004, the manufacturing plants were permanently shut down and the facility converted to a Terminal operation for storage, loading, and unloading of nitrogenous fertilizers from other locations. Although Terra Nitrogen, L.P. has recently changed status from a manufacturing plant to a terminal, the facility (including the barge loading/unloading dock) has been in operation since 1965.\n\nIt is Terra Nitrogen's policy to prevent accidental releases from the terminal by effective process safety management (PSM) programs and procedures. Terra requires participation by terminal employees in every element of the PSM program.\n\nOne way Terra prevents incidents is by conducting regular analysis of process hazards utilizing current operating and accurate process safety information. The operations personnel draft and maintain current operating procedures. Terra provides timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment. It is our policy to oversee the activities of contractors and ensure that they are trained to perform their jobs safely. We follow established pre-startup safety reviews and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety and administer a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards. We immediately investigate incidents when they do occur so that we promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience.\n\nIt is our policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan and a well-trained and equipped onsite emergency response team. We also maintain a system to notify neigh"
