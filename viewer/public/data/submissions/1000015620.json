      "SummaryText": "DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe East Houston Facility is a butane blending facility. The facility is located in\nHouston, TX. The regulated substance at this facility is butane. The equipment which handles butane is piping. The piping may contain a maximum of 183,677 lbs of butane.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe East Houston Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations,and maintenance procedures. These assets will begin operating under the name Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. on August 30, 2010.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION\nAs discussed in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the EPA has defined the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. At East Houston, the regulated substance is butane which is a flammable substance. This WCS assumes the entire quantity contained in the largest vessel or section of piping within the butane system releases to the atmosphere, forms a vapor cloud, and is subsequently detonated. One (1) pound per square inch overpressure is used as the endpoint as this is the threshold for potentially serious injuries to people from flying glass, falling debris, and other explosion effects.  \n\nAt East Houston the largest quantity of the covered flammable substance, butane, is the piping system.  The WCS assumes the piping is ruptured due to external forces releasing the entire line fill catastrophically to the atmosphere and the vapor cloud formed is ignited and then at some distance from the center of the explosion reaches an endpoint of o"

Using RMP*Comp to calculate the distance to endpoint, a 0.5 mile radius is estimated to be impacted if the worst case type of release occurred at East Houston.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION\nFor the butane blending facility, the alternative case scenario is a release from a butane offloading hose/pipe rupture due to a manufacturing defect. The maximum operational flow rate during offloading is 2,581 lbs per min.  Once rupture occurs the truck driver takes action to discontinue offload pumping and initiate emergency shutdown.  The truck driver takes 5 minutes to complete discontinuation of pumping and emergency shutdown. A check valve located at the unloading skid will contain product between the skid and the manifold.  \n\nIn this situation, modeling the scenario as a vapor cloud fire using RMP*Comp, the release rate is estimated to be 8,360 lbs per min and the estimated distance to the lower flammability limit is less than 0.1 miles.  The total amount released is 41,800 lbs of butane.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\nThe regulated butane blending process in the facility is compliant with the thirteen (13) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures. The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility. There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA. The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\". The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges. Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThe butane process at East Houston is a new process and therefore does no"

In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane process. As opportunities for improvement associated with this process arises at the East Houston Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P."
