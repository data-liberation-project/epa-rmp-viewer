No onsite or offsite injuries occurred.  A shelter in place was declare for a one mile radius around the facility by local emergency responders.  In addition, roads surrounding the facility were shut down for approximately two hours.  There was significant damage to the onsite Thermal Oxidizer during the incident.  The process was put through a process hazards analysis and correction actions were taken to help prevent reoccurrence. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nIn the event that a chemical release does occur, Dover Chemical has an emergency response program that includes trained onsite emergency responders and coordination with the City of Dover Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee. If an emergency did occur, plant personnel will immediately activate our emergency response team to contain and minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through local emergency management agencies.\r\nPlanning to Maintain a Sa"

The prevention program has twelve elements designed to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\r\nOur facility is committed to personnel safety, public safety, and continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance. Based on this commitment, the EHS Manager and the PSM/RMP Leader have assumed responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program. We have also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the twelve prevention program elements.\r\nOur prevention measures include, but are not limited to, the use of:\r\n- Chlorine and hydrochloric acid process area detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\r\n- Fence line chlorine and hydrochloric acid detectors to assist in emergency response;\r\n- Operator attended truck loading and unloading operations;\r\n- Automatic shutoff systems for chlorine unloading operations;\r\n- Video camera on the rail car operation to assist the operator in making a rapid decision on whether to shut the automatic valve.\r\n- Secondary containment around tanks;\r\n- An emergency scrubber for chlorine vents that will effectively capture vapors in the event of a spill or leak;\r\n- Process safety information to document the safe process design;\r\n- Process hazards analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\r\n- Operating procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\r\n- Maintenance, inspection and testing to ensure that the system is maintained according to applicable standards and manufacturer's recommendations;\r\n- Training, hot work permits, contractor safety and employee participation programs to ensure that all employees and contractors working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safel"

      "SummaryText": "The Dover Chemical Corporation plant manufactures a variety of fire retardant and surfactant chemicals for customers who make consumer and commercial products. Certain raw materials and by-products are toxic chemicals that are regulated under EPA Risk Management Programs regulations that can be hazardous if released to the air in large quantities.\r\nDover Chemical Corporation is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities. We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. If there is an emergency, we will immediately mobilize our emergency response team to contain and minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through local emergency management agencies. \r\n\r\nToxic Regulated Substances Handled\r\nChlorine:  Chlorine is a raw material that is delivered as a pressurized liquid in rail cars and is a gas at atmospheric temperature and pressure.  This material has a pungent, irritating odor and poses a severe inhalation hazard.  \r\n\r\nAq. HCL:  Aq. HCl is a product of the chlorination and phosphites processes. Anhydrous HCl is generated in the production of our products and is immediately absorbed into water to make the product acid.  This acid is shipped to customers via tank trucks and rail cars.  Hydrochloric Acid has a pungent, irritating odor and poses a severe inhalation and skin hazard.  \r\n\r\nPhosphorous Trichloride: PCl3 is a raw material used in the phosphites processes.  PCl3 is a liquid at atmospheric temperatures and pressures and can be delivered in rail cars, tank trucks or iso-containers. \r\n\r\nPhosphorus trichloride has a pungent, irritating odor similar to that of hydrochloric acid.
