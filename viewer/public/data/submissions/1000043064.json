      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant (BOP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by continued participation in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), as well as through the resources invested in accident prevention as outlined below.  BOP has been awarded the coveted STAR recognition by OSHA for excellence in occupational safety and health.  \r\n\r\nExxonMobil Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, We further believe Exxon[Mobil] to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at BOP.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements have been implemented for the entire plant.  This is the same approach taken with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. \r\n\r\nIn addition, ExxonMobil has implemented its Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  OIMS includes aspects of EPA's prevention program.  As already mentioned, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participatio"

      "SummaryText": "n \r\nBOP encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention, key thrusts of the OSHA VPP program.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the accident prevention program.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\nBOP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis \r\nBOP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that controls are in place to manage these hazards.  New projects that add facilities are analyzed as part of the design process to ensure that the controls necessary to adequately manage the hazards associated with the facilities are installed as part of the project.  Section 7.4.d-g of the RMP report represent the covered process and not a single PHA.\r\n\r\nBOP primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a regulated substance is accidentally released. \r\n\r\nBOP maintains a volunteer fire brigade comprised of plant employees for the purpose of prevention, controlling/containing and suppressing industrial fires or chemicals releases. \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for BOP is coordinated with the Greater Baytown Area Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  BOP has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \r\n\r\nThe Operations Integrity Management System forms the cornerstone for continuous improvement in the Baytown Olefin Plant's safety-related systems. These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through improvement steps such as implementation of recommendations from hazard reviews, assessments, and any incident investigations. The ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant has taken significant steps to reduce the potential for incidents that could impact the surrounding community.  Planned changes to improve safety include:\r\n\u00bf\tContinue to improve and enhance the recently implemented Loss Prevention System (LPS);\r\n\u00bf\tImplement OIMS Critical Verifications and Measurements; and,\r\n\u00bf\tEnhance work permit system refresher training."

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and amended as necessary. \r\n\r\nBOP has identified operating limits (i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.) This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nBOP has implemented a comprehensive training program.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  Operations and mechanical personnel periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.  \r\n\r\nContractors \r\nBOP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
