This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to receive, transfer and redistribute propane and a commercial butane mixture to wholesale customers.  The flammable products arrive at our facility via pipeline, rail car, or transport trucks.  The facility has several storage tanks and a propane dehydration unit associated with the transfer operations.  The two products are redelivered to wholesale customers for transport via pipeline, rail car or transport truck.  Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, maintenance contractors, transport truck drivers and rail car switching personnel.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substances handled at this facility are propane and a commercial mixed butane product which varies in composition depending upon the original source of the product.  Propane and commercial butane are transferred to underground storage wells for long term storage.  The propane and commercial  butane, along with a relatively pure liquid ethane product, are handled by the nearby Petal storage facility.  The ethane is received from PHMSA regulated pipelines, sent to storage in an underground liquid storage well, and is returned to P"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and rev"
