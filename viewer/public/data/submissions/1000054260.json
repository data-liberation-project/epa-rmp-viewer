Blue Starr in Claremore, Oklahoma. The Facility treats water drawn from Claremore Lake to drinking water standards for residential and industrial use. The Facility uses one (1) regulated substance (chlorine) above the threshold quantity of the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68). Facilities that use or store any toxic or flammable substances listed in 40 CFR 68.130 above the specified threshold quantities in a process, are required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program enforced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\nThe goal of this Risk Management Program is to prevent an accidental release of chlorine that could potentially cause harm to the public and/or the environment, and to mitigate the severity of any release that does occur. The Risk Management Program includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program. \n\nThe Facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the chlorine system, the Facility's emergency action plan requires an immediate evacuation of the Facility and immediate notification of the Claremore Fire Department. The Claremore Fire Department will be responsible for responding to the emergency and directing any required public evacuation or sheltering in place. The Facility has discussed this Emergency Response Plan with the Claremore Fire Department and members of the Claremore Fire Department have inspected the facility. The Claremore Fire Department has the necessary equipment required to seal a leak in a chlorine con-container. They are also equipped w"

These individuals will change the tanks at both plants.\n\nThe Facility has implemented the Risk Management Program's Level 3 Release Prevention Program. Under this program, the Facility has compiled process safety information and performed a process hazard analysis, developed and implemented written operating procedures and trained the employees that operate or maintain the chlorine system. The Facility has also implemented maintenance and inspection procedures to ensure the mechanical integrity of the chlorine system's equipment. Prior to implementing any change to the chlorine system, a management of change procedure will be adhered to including a pre-startup review of the chlorine system. The Facility will perform a compliance audit every three (3) years and will investigate all actual releases and any incident that could have resulted in a release. The Facility has involved its employees in the development of the Facility's Risk Management Program. The Facility requires the use of hot work permits involving any welding or other heat generating work either on or near to the chlorine system, and has implemented procedures for training of contractors and verifying contractor's qualifications. \n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at the Facility is approximately 4,000 pounds contained in the two (2) chlorine one ton-containers and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.

      "SummaryText": "orine equipment is housed in a building., however the one ton-containers are delivered by truck and are offloaded outside of the Chlorine Room. \n\nThe Worst-case release scenario for chlorine would be an accident during offloading resulting In the rupture of one ton chlorine-container and the release of its entire contents over  a ten (10) minute period. This release would disperse in the atmosphere and the chlorine \n\nConcentration would diminish with distance from the Facility. The EPA defines a 3 part per million (ppm) concentration of chlorine in the air as not having any serious long-term health effects on the Public. Based on the Compliance Guidance and Model Risk \nManagement Program for Water Treatment Plants (WTP Guidance) prepared by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the EPA, the distance from the Facility to the point where the chlorine concentration has diminished to 3 ppm is 3.1 miles. This distance is known as the end-point distance. The area of potential impact is defined as a circle with its center point at the Facility and extending outward to the end-point distance, in this case 2.5 miles. 1999 census data as calculated by the land View TM III program Indicate that approximately 11,141 people live within this area of potential impact. The Claremore Quadrangle U.S.Geological Survey 7.5 Minute Series Topographic map (Claremore Quadrangle map), a Delorme Street Atlas USA@ street map (Delorme map), and the MARPlOT@ map indicate the area at potential impact contains at least one school, residence, hospital, park, jail, and commercial, office, or industrial area. A review of the Claremore Quadrangle, the Delorme map, and the MARPlOT@ map failed to Identify any sensitive environmental receptors with the area of potential impact.   \n\nA more realistic release scenario known as the alternative-case release scenario was identified in a process hazard analysis (PHA) of the Facility's chlorine system. This release would be much smaller than the worst"

      "SummaryText": "-case release, and it was estimated that it could be contained within one (1) hour or less by the Claremore Fire Department. This release could occur if an operator failed to properly attach the regulator to the chlorine ton- container's valve, and then opened the valve. This would cause a release of chlorine through the open valve at a maximum sustained rate of 10.7 Lb/min. This would immediately cause a very high concentration of chlorine in the Chlorine Room requiring the operator to immediately evacuate the chlorine building and implement the Facility's emergency action plan. As noted above, the Claremore Fire Department would be notified under the Facility's emergency action plan and all employees would evacuate the Facility. It is anticipated that the Claremore Fire Department would use SCBA to enter the Chlorine Room and close the valve. Using the WTP Guidance for a 10.7 Lb/min chlorine release over a 60-minute time, the endpoint distance is determined to be 0.56 miles. LandViewTM III census data indicate that approximately 477 people live within this area of potential impact. A review of the Claremore Quadrangle, the Delorme map, and the MARPlOT@ map failed to identify any sensitive environmental receptors with the area of potential impact."
