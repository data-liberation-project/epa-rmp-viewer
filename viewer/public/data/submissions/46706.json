The Pedricktown facility has had no such accidental releases.\n\nE. Prevention Program Elements\n\nManagement System - A management system has been developed that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) to a qualified individual or position of responsibility.  It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\nProcess Safety Information - Up-to-date process safety information will be maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.65.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessment- A PHA with risk assessment has been performed for the Program 3 covered process at the Pedricktown plant in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.67 and N.J.A.C. 7:31-4.2.  The PHA was performed using the What-If/Checklist method.  The PHA identified the hazards associated with the ammonia process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases.  Issues identified during the PHA were documented and addressed in a timely manner. The PHA with risk assessment will continue to be revalidated and updated once every five years.\n\nOperating Procedures - Operating procedures have been developed and will be maintained for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.69 and N.J.A.C. 7:31-4.3.  Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process.

Operating procedures also incorporate or reference relevant process safety information. \n\nTraining - A training program has been developed for employees working with the covered process in accordance with 40 Part CFR 68.71 and N.J.A.C. 7:31-4.4.  The training includes an overview of the process and emphasizes process operating procedures, safe work practices, health and safety hazards, and emergency operations including shutdown. Those employees already involved in operating or maintaining a covered process prior to June 21, 1999 have been trained (via annual refresher training) to have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities as specified in the operating procedures.\n\nRefresher training will be provided at a minimum of once every three years to all employees involved in working with the covered process.  Documentation will be maintained for each employee to ensure that he or she received and understood the required training.\n\nThe training program includes written job descriptions, which include the duties and responsibilities for each EHS operator position.  The qualifications required for the personnel responsible for training the EHS operators is also included in the training program.\n\nMechanical Integrity - A mechanical integrity program has been developed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.73 and N.J.A.C. 7:31-4.5 for covered process equipment.

Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance, inspection or testing are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  The mechanical integrity program also includes a quality assurance program.\n\nA system has been implemented for maintaining records of inspections, breakdowns, repairs and replacements of EHS equipment.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - A written MOC procedure has been implemented to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.75 and N.J.A.C. 7:31-4.6.  The MOC procedure does not apply to replacements in kind which are defined as replacements that satisfy the original design specifications (e.g., replace a pressure reducing valve with a new identical valve supplied by the original equipment manufacturer).\n\nAll employees involved in operating or maintaining the modified process are informed of the change and trained accordingly prior to startup of the modified process.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) - PSSRs are performed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.77 and N.J.A.C. 7:31-4.7 for new covered processes and for modified covered processes when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.

Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Pedricktown Cogeneration Plant (PCP) is owned by Pedricktown Cogeneration Company Limited Partnership (PCLP) and operated under contract by Wood Group Power Operations (WGPO).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia in its Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) air pollution control system.  The ammonia vapors reduce the nitrogen oxide (Nox) content in the gas turbine exhaust.  Generally, the process involves receipt of anhydrous ammonia by way of tanker trucks and storage in a 12,000 gallon storage tank.  The ammonia vapor is mixed with air and then injected into the exhaust stream.  The ammonia is drawn into the injection system from the storage tank through a supply line.\n\nAs a result of this process, anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity (TQ) specified by EPA regulations and the 5,200 pound TQ specified by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).  PCP has one covered process that requires compliance with Program 3 of both the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and the New Jersey TCPA regulation.\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of PCLP\n\nPCLP is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Emergency Response Program/Plan.\n\nSafety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nAs per the revised EPA RMP regulations published in the Federal Register on 4/9/04, information concerning the offsite consequence analyses was removed from the Executive Summary.\n\nD.

Procedures are in place to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employees in covered process areas.  Periodically, the performance of the contract owner or operator is evaluated while working in or adjacent to a covered process.\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\n\nPCP has an emergency response program that includes an emergency response plan addressing the regulated substance present at the facility.\n\nThe emergency response plan is reviewed to reflect changes at the facility and ensure that employees are informed of the changes.  The emergency response program includes procedures for the use of on-site emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance.  Employees are trained periodically on emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe emergency response program also includes:\n\u00b7 A schedule for initial and annual refresher emergency response training for employees in relevant procedures to implement the emergency response plan;\n\u00b7 A schedule to perform at least one emergency response exercise per calendar year;\n\u00b7 a written assessment of the emergency response plan and of the adequacy or need for emergency response equipment after each plan implementation or exercise;\n\u00b7 A description of the emergency notification system at the stationary source.\n\nG.
