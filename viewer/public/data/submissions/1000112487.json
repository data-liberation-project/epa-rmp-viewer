Emergency Response Program\nThe Lakeland Facility has an Ammonia Emergency Response Plan (AERP) in place. The site has internal emergency response capability and has developed a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120. Publix responders receive \u0093HAZMAT\u0094 refresher training annually and the current plan is coordinated with the City of Lakeland's Fire Department and the Polk County Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee. Members of the fire department participate in HAZMAT training response exercises conducted at the facility, annually along with Publix responders.  In an emergency involving ammonia, facility responders work with the fire department on response.   Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519.\n\n6. Plans to Improve Safety\nTo improve safety, Publix has developed a team that consists of upper management, environmental compliance, and legal counsel who meet quarterly to review the status of all outstanding audit items until they are complete."

      "SummaryText": "cess Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. The PSM Program was established in October 1994 for the three existing ammonia processes. Prior to startup of the Freezer/Dairy ammonia process in July 2001, a PSM program was established. The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced. This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment. In developing the PSM Program, the Lakeland Facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process. These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices. These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained. Other safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely. Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the maintenance of Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found. These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards, and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed. The staff also has performed Process Hazard Analyses of these processes as required. Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies. The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of associates at all levels.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\nThe Lakeland Facility"
