In addition, the largest unit is enclosed in a building.  Release of the entire amount of ammonia on plant site, which represents the worst-case scenario,  would leave our plant site; however, no public or environmental receptors are within the exposure distance.  Model used:  EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations.\n\n  o  Epichlorohydrin - Failure of the storage tank filled with the largest amount possible would release 140,000 lbs into a concrete dike that limits the exposed surface area of the liquid pool and thus reduces the release rate.  No public or environmental receptors are within the exposure distance resulting from the worst case release.  Model used:  Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA).\n\n  o  Oleum - Failure of the storage tank filled with the largest amount possible would release 440,000 lbs into a concrete dike that limits the exposed surface area of the liquid pool and thus reduces the release rate.  Since no vapors would leave the plant site, no public or environmental receptors are within the exposure distance.  Model used:  EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.\n\n  o  Phosgene - This material is used in a one-ton cylinder enclosed in a special room.  Failure of the cylinder would release 2000 lbs into the room.  A population of 1089 would be affected by this release which consists only of residences with no schools, hospitals, prisons, recreation areas, office areas, or industrial areas in the impacted zone.  This cylinder could not catastrophically fail since it can withstand impact of a locomotive.  No environmental receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.

The overpressure of 1psi would fail to leave the plant site.  No public or environmental receptors are within this overpressure distance.  We are using the Predictive Filing option to indicate that, in the near future, additional propane will be stored at Martin.  Two additional tanks, each containing 110,000 lbs. of propane will be installed during 1999.  The new overpressure of 1psi would leave the plant site but does not reach any public nor environmental receptors.  Model used:  EPA's RMP Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities Reference Tables or Equations.\n\n\nAlternate-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\no  Phosgene - A cylinder leak of 50 lbs. would leave the plant site; however, no public receptors would be impacted.  It would take a leak of 100 lbs. to impact any public receptors.  VanDeMark Chemical Company Inc controls cylinder leaks through detailed mechanical integrity of these vessels.  A leak repair kit is maintained on the Martin plant site.  The plant's Fire and Emergency Brigade is trained in the use of this leak repair kit.  No releases of this chemical have ever been experienced outside the manufacturing area.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n\n4  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Martin plant complies with all EPA Regulations at 40 CFR Part 68; OSHA Regulations at 29 CFR 1910; Clean Water Act Regulations at 40 CFR 112; RCRA Regulations at 40 CFR 264, 265, & 279.52; and EPCRA Rules and Laws.

Safety objectives are an annual part of the Martin Results Sharing Success.  Clear accountability for safety performance is part of each employee's annual review.\n\nUse of the Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) process assures public comments and concerns are considered in both design and operation of the plant's process safety systems.  All elements of the RMP and PSM programs are used to ensure that sufficient layers of protection exist through technology, facilities and personnel to prevent escalation from a single failure to a catastrophic event.\n\nAll plant operators are trained and certified in the jobs that they do.  Every employee has the authority to shutdown any process or to stop any job, in order to maintain a safe operation.  Training programs cover job specific tasks, principles of chemical processing, safety, and regulatory issues.\n\nAll plant process equipment is subjected to EPA and OSHA mechanical integrity inspections to look for corrosion or wear.  All storage and process vessels are protected against over-pressure by safety relief valves.  Process shutdown systems are built-in to our process control computers. These safety devices and shutdown systems are periodically inspected and tested.  Predictive Maintenance techniques are utilized to address problems before they happen.  All plant modifications and procedure changes undergo a management of change process that involves operator, maintenance, engineering, technical and management review.  \n\nIn the unlikely event of a release, we feel the best method of protection for our community is to shelter in place away from the hazard.

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems dictate the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.  \n\n\n5  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has never been a worst-case scenario type event in our history at Martin.  No offsite incidents have ever occurred.  The Martin plant is approaching five years without a lost time accident.  No serious incidents have taken place within the manufacturing unit; however, OSHA recordable accidents have occurred.  We keep records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at Martin.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's Risk Management Program rule during the past five years.  \n\nA Phosgene release of 1ppm was detected during January, 1996.\n\nFor each of these incidents, we have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\n\n6  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Martin plant maintains an integrated emergency response plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.

Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of key improvements that the Martin plant is committed to implementing to help prevent and better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n  o  First Step - A video presentation designed to enhance and improve supervision's role in safety.  It will teach front line supervisors that they are directly accountable for safety in their areas.  This program is expected to minimize the amount of unsafe acts that occur in the plant.\n\n  o  Gas Masks - The type of gas masks worn at Martin will be changed.  This change is prompted by our desire to obtain units that have NIOSH approval.  The new masks will allow our operators to switch from negative pressure (air purifying) applications to positive pressure (airline & SCBA) applications without changing units.  Additionally, these masks will reduce the volume of part's storage, and the canisters used are for all air purifying applications encountered at Martin.\n\n  o  Air Monitoring Program - The Martin plant's IH will initiate a program to monitor surrounding environments in manufacturing during processes that use highly hazardous materials.  All production procedures have been reviewed to identify potential employee exposures.  Low hazardous materials and previously monitored materials will be reviewed during subsequent years.  It is anticipated that within a five year span, all materials at Martin will have been monitored.\n\n  o  CWTP Monitoring System - Operator exposure risk associated with the CWTP headworks pit was discovered by safety personnel.  Vendors have been requested to specify monitoring systems for installation in this area.  An on-line system wi"
