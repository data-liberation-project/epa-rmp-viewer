      "SummaryText": "            The Cliff Drive Water Treatment Plant, located in Branson, Missouri, has been in operation since\n\n1964. It is designed to produce 1.3 million gallons of high quality drinking water per day. The facility lies on \n\napproximately 3 acres of land that is equal to or lower in elevation than most of the surrounding terrain. \n\nThe plant is manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week by experienced, certified operators, under the \n\ndirection of an Operations Supervisor. \n\n            A chemical storage building and operations building occupy the site along with a series of outside \n\nbasins. Chemicals used on site are Polyaluminum Hydroxychloride, Hydrofluosilicic Acid ( Fluoride ), and \n\nChlorine. Each of these chemicals are potentially hazardous if not handled properly. Polyaluminum \n\nHydroxychloride is used in the treatment process as a coagulant to settle suspended solids in the outside \n\nsettling basins, prior to filtration. It is only considered hazardous because of a low pH in its concentrated \n\nform and requires minimal safety requirments. The two remaining chemicals that are used in the treatment \n\nprocess, require strict safety practices in handling.\n\n            Fluoride is used in water treatment as a prevention for tooth decay. Fluoride is a natural component \n\nin most water supplies but amounts are usually not high enough to be of any benefit for this purpose. \n\nEnough fluoride is added to our water supply to obtain 1 to 1.5 MG/L residual. While fluoride is safe when \n\nused properly, it is considered hazardous in its concentrated form. We receive fluoride in 15 gallon carboy \n\ncontainers. It is then pumped at a specified rate into the water supply.\n\n            Chlorine is used in the disinfection process of the water treatment. A residual of 1.4 to 1.8 MG/L \n\nremains in the finished water leaving the plant. Chlorination is a safe and effective way to prevent \n\nbacterial contamination in the water system. However, chlorine in a gas or a compressed liqu"

A vacuum system is used to remove the chlorine from the cylinders at a specified \n\nrate. Should the system fail, causing loss of vacuum, regulators mounted on the pressure manifold will \n\nclose to prevent any loss of chlorine into the atmosphere. Employees who handle chlorine are required to \n\nreceive extensive training prior to working with the chemical and are involved in continous training to stay \n\nup to date with safety practices.\n\n            As of June 21, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency requires that all facilities which store \n\nchemicals such as chlorine in quantities greater than 2500 pounds, to establish a Risk Management \n\nProgram. The Risk Management Progam for the Cliff Drive Water Treatment Plant includes an Emergency \n\nResponse Plan that will be put into action in the event of a hazardous chemical release. This plan provides \n\n\nguidelines to assure that hazardous materials (HAZMAT) emergencies are handled in a manner consistent \n\nwith current regulations and safety practices. The plan is intended to cover all releases of hazardous \n\nchemicals regardless of size. Although a small spill or leak does not entail the same complex response \n\nmechanism as a massive release, it still has the potential to produce localized injury or damage. The intent \n\nof this plan is to ensure that all plant personnel approach every HAZMAT incident from an informed \n\nperspective. In this way, adequate precautions can be taken to minimize the degree of hazard to our \n\nemployees and the public.\n\n            During a hazardous material emergency response at the plant, a trained supervisor will take \n\ncharge of response activities. The trained supervisor will first assess whether the release is considered \n\nemergency or incidental. Incidental releases will be handled by plant personnel, while emergency releases \n\nwill"

The plan also decribes specific responsibilities of trained individuals, as well as steps \n\nof mobilization, mitigation, and types of safety equipment needed. Clean-up procedures and levels of \n\ntraining to perform clean-up are described.
