Four containers (8,000 lbs maximum) are physically connected to the process at one time, however, a crossoever valve allows only two manifolded containers to be drawn from at one time.  Other containers, full and empty, are stored in the same room; they are seperated and marked accordingly.\n\nThe Chlorine is drawn into the plant effluent under vacuum.  If there were to be a loss of power, the vacuum would hault, and the flow of gas from the container would cease.  The vacuum feed system is a key safety feature, as it fails in a closed position.\n\n\nPrevention Activities\n\nAll facility staff are trained in emergency procedures and the hazards associated with Chlorine, and operators and maintainers of the process are trained in safe procedures for using and repairing the process equipment.  Operators check the process components daily.  Tank Changing Audits are performed quarterly to identify any definciencies in procedures or safe work practices. \n\nThe Chlorine building is locked except when personnel are present performing inspections and duties.  Chemical release detection sensors are located in the feed rate control and storage rooms, and are connected to audible and visual alarm indicators.  After working hours, the alarm activates the automatic phone dialer and key personnel are called.  Detection of a chemical leak shuts down the air handling units in the builing to passively mitigate offsite migration.",

The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System authorized by section 402 of the Clean Water Act requires Persigo to use A?Best Management PracticesA? to reduce pollutants to the \"Maximum Extent Practicable.A?  To meet the water quality parameters set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the Best Management Practices include physical and biological treatment to substantially remove the pollutants received from the community through the sewer system.  Biological treatment is followed by the chemical destruction of pathogens to meet disinfection criteria.  Persigo uses chlorine gas for disinfection, and sulfur dioxide gas to remove residual chlorine before discharging the treated effluent.  \n\nWhen Congress passed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, it required the EPA to publish regulations and guidance for chemical accident prevention at facilities using extremely hazardous substances.  The Risk Management Plan Rule, written to implement Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, requires all facilities that use certain flammable or toxic substances above quantities specified in 40 CFR 68.130, to develop a Risk Management Program.  Many POTWs, like Persigo, must develop a Risk Management Program which shall include a(n): \n  A?    Hazard assessment that details the potential effects of an accidental release, an accident history of the last five years, and an evaluation of worst-case and alternative accidental releases; \n  A?    Prevention program that includes safety precautions and maintenance, monitoring, and employee training measures; and \n  A?    Emergency response program that spells out emergency heal"

Therefore, the Persigo RMP is intended to help those who are charged with preventing, preparing for and responding to a chemical accident.  Because the RMP summary periodically submitted to the EPA is publicly available, it may also be useful to citizens in understanding one of the potential hazards in their community.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nAll Persigo employees are aware that health and safety are more important than just quickly completing a task.  For this reason, Persigo will strive to provide the safest possible process to protect the community and our employees.  The Persigo RMP as a whole is reviewed, audited, and revised periodically to ensure we are doing the best we can with available resources.  \n\n     Department Heads and Managers: The safety and health of employees and the public shall be given full consideration in the planning, development, and operation of hazardous processes at Persigo.  Support and assist supervisors in their safety efforts and reward them for attention to safety planning, equipping and training of staff. \n\n     Supervisors and Lead Workers: Encourage involvement of all employees in safety awareness, and make sure that each job activity is done safely.  Plan ahead to anticipate safety and health hazards for each activity.  Train and equip workers appropriately for the specific acti"

Utilize the safety resources provided by the City, and communicate any safety needs to a safety coordinator, risk manager, and/or affected parties.  Promptly investigate and report accidents and A?near-missesA? that could contribute to injuries, equipment failure, or chemical releases.  Finally, ensure that every employee is empowered and rewarded for contributing to making hazardous processes safer. \n\n     Employees: Take responsibility for your own safety.  Frequently inspect process components and promptly report and resolve any problems or potential for system failure.  Communicate any safety needs that you see to someone that can get the need met.  Make use of safety equipment that is required for handling, storing and using hazardous chemicals.  Be considerate of the safety of your fellow workers, and work together to promote safe work practices. Make the most of opportunities that can minimize danger to employees, the community, and the environment. \n\nAll employees, supervisors and managers must continuously work together to promote the safety and wellness of our workforce and the community.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe facilityA?s emergency action plan includes procedures for gathering information about the release to provide to the 911 dispatcher and subsequently the Grand Junction Hazardous Materials (HazMat) response team during an uncontrolled release.  Persigo employees may attempt to contain an uncontrolled release by closing the building doors when safe to do so, using an SCBA when appropriate, and facilitate the evacuation of employees, visitors, contractors, or other bystanders from downwind areas.  Persigo employees shall not try to fix a major leak, but will remain available to their supervisor or incident commander to aid as needed in a capacity commensurate with their training.

The emergency action plan is in writing, kept in the workplace, and is available to employees for review.  It contains the following: procedures for reporting a chemical release, fire or other emergency, procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before evacuation, procedures for emergency evacuation, and procedures to account for all employees.  All employees are trained in American Red Cross First Aid/CPR/AED.  There are employee rosters and emergency phone numbers posted in strategic locations to facilitate accounting for employees and proper spill and response notifications.  \n\nPersigo uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide sensors inside the chemical storage and feed control rooms that will activate an alarm system upon sensing one or both of the hazardous chemicals.  The alarm system activates visual and audible alarms in and around the chemical feed building and in the operations office, and, after working hours, activates an automatic dialer to notify an off-site plant operator.  Written procedures are available on how to respond and who to notify during or after working hours.\n\nThe Grand Junction HazMat Team has had specific on-site training at Persigo to prepare for and respond to a release at this facility.  The Mesa County Local Emergency Planning Committee has reviewed a hazard summary of this facility as presented by the Grand Junction Fire Department, and has received annual Tier II reports for response and community right-to-know purposes.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nEquipment and components related to receiving and using process chemicals are inspected and maintained according to manufacturer recommendations.

Persigo staff uses RMP*CompA? software for the EPA required consequence analysis.  CAMEOA?, ALOHAA?, and MARPLOTA? are also available for  more detailed dispersion modeling for emergency response purposes.  RMP*CompA? is a very basic tool that does not account for variations in terrain, but implements the RMP consequence analysis procedures recommended by the EPA.\n\n\nCHEMICAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:  The scenario is largely determined by the chemical, the size of the vessel connected to the process, and general terrain. Atmospheric conditions and other parameters are preset in the software.  One container of sulfur dioxide is released to the atmosphere at 200lbs per minute.  This discharges the contents of a full one-ton container in 10 minutes, which does not give time for HazMat to assemble, evaluate the scene, isolate the chemical, evacuate affected areas, and mitigate the leak.  The toxic endpoint (0.0078 mg/L) is reached at 3.1 miles.  The basis for the toxic endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guidline-2 (ERPG-2).  The ERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1-hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects of symptoms which could impair an individualA?s ability to take protective action.  The A?worst-caseA? includes the assumpt"

Assumed atmospheric conditions were as follows: wind speed 3.4 miles/hour, atmospheric stability class F, and an air temperature of 77 degrees F.  Modeling the result of high-impact malicious actions are not in the scope of evaluating the worst-case process failure required by the RMP Rule.\n\nAlternative release scenario #1:  Alternative scenarios have more flexibility in modeling a more realistic situation.  Chlorine was released through a 0.25 sq.in. hole from a broken connection, faulty fuse plug, or the like.  The assumptions are 77 degrees F, wind speed of 6.7 mph, and a tank pressure of 45psi; the HazMat team took 25 minutes to isolate the area, account for employees, assess the situation and stop the leak.  The estimated toxic endpoint (ERPG-2) is 0.2 miles.\n\nAlternative scenario #2:  Sulfur dioxide was released through a 0.25sq.in. hole from a connector, faulty fuse plug, etc.  The assumptions are 85 degrees F, a wind speed of 6.7 mph, and a tank pressure of 40psi; the HazMat team took 25 minutes to isolate the area, account for employees, assess the situation and stop the leak.
