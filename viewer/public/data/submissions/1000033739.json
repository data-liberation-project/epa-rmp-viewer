      "SummaryText": "Flint Hills Resources Fairmont, LLC\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nFlint Hills Resources Fairmont, LLC (FHR Fairmont) is a fuel ethanol plant operating in Fairmont, Nebraska. FHR Fairmont has the capacity to process approximately 36 million bushels of grain per year and produce approximately 115 million gallons of denatured ethanol per year. This facility also produces dry and modified distiller's grain with solubles and corn oil as saleable co-products.\r\n\r\nCorn is predominately delivered via truck to FHR Fairmont; however the site has the capability to accept corn deliveries via rail if the need arises. The corn is processed in a hammermill system where the grain is ground into flour. This flour is blended with hot water and enzymes to produce a mash. The mash is then pumped into the fermentation process. In the fermentation process, yeast and enzymes are added to the mash to convert the starch to sugars, which are then converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide. The resulting liquid (beer) contains ethanol. After approximately 54 hours, the beer in the fermentation tanks is pumped to a beer well.\r\n\r\nThe beer mixture is then sent through a series of evaporators before entering the distillation process. In the distillation process, the product is pumped to the top of the stripper column and is heated. The ethanol vaporizes and is collected in the rectifier, producing approximately 190 proof ethanol (95% ethanol and 5% water). The 190 proof ethanol is sent to outside storage tanks before being brought back into the distillation process for product completion. The 190 proof ethanol is super heated and sent to the molecular sieve beds where the remaining water is removed to produce 200 proof ethanol (100% ethanol). The 200 proof ethanol is then condensed and pumped to outside storage tanks.\r\n\r\nThe whole stillage (beer without ethanol) is centrifuged to produce thin stillage and a solid fraction. The thin stillage is sent to an evaporator where the water is ev"

      "SummaryText": "aporated to produce syrup containing about 27 to 30 percent solids. The syrup is added to the solid fraction, which is referred to as wet distiller's grain and solubles. FHR Fairmont will sell the wet distillers grain with solubles or transfer it to a dryer. The dryer will dry the wet distiller's grain with solubles to about 12 percent moisture, which is referred to as dried distiller's grains with solubles.\r\n\r\nThe 200 proof ethanol is denatured with gasoline. Denaturing is required to render the ethanol unfit for human consumption. The gasoline used may either be unleaded gasoline or natural gasoline (sometimes referred to as well head gasoline or well head drip gas). The facility has chosen natural gasoline, due to restrictions on specifications of impurities for fuel ethanol in some states. Fuel ethanol can be combined with 15% gasoline to make E85 (85% ethanol) for use in Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFV), or with 90% unleaded gasoline to make E10 (10% ethanol) for use in common automobiles. Ethanol is added to gasoline as an oxygenation agent to aid combustion and reduce pollution.\r\n\r\nThe process of making fuel ethanol at a plant this  includes two processes that are covered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). There is a 18,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tank and a 200,000 gallon natural gasoline tank. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the ethanol production process to control the pH level in the fermentation process.\r\n\r\nFor FHR Fairmont, this RMP is completed only on the natural gasoline storage tank and the anhydrous ammonia storage tank, associated piping, pumps, and metering controls.\r\n\r\nFHR Fairmont has implemented programs that address accidental release prevention measures covered by both the EPA RMP and OSHA PSM rules.  The general prevention program aligns with elements of those rules including, developing process safety information, conducting process hazard analyses, implementing written operating procedures (including safe work and hot work practices), training"

      "SummaryText": "operators, establishing written mechanical integrity programs, conducting pre-startup reviews, managing changes, conducting compliance audits and incident investigations, contractor evaluation, and developing programs that allow for employee participation.\r\n\r\nFHR Fairmont has an active preventative maintenance program that incorporates the inspection of the natural gasoline (denaturant) storage tank, the anhydrous ammonia storage tank, and their associated piping and equipment. In an effort to protect the environment, the denaturant tank is situated in a bermed area to provide secondary containment in the event of an accidental uncontrolled release. FHR Fairmont uses the local fire department to respond to emergencies, but also has an emergency action plan. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the physical protection of secondary containment, there is also a fusible link valve on the denaturant tank. This valve closes in the event of a fire, preventing the tank to drain through a damaged header or ruptured pipe. The facility also maintains an inventory of fire-fighting foam eductors to be used by the local fire department in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system is considered to be well protected with the equipment specified for the installation of the tank. This protective equipment includes the excess flow check valves, break away fittings, and relief valves. FHR Fairmont performs preventative maintenance on this system.\r\n\r\nFHR Fairmont also has a Process Safety Management (PSM) program. This is another tool that enhances employee safety programs, protects the environment, and assists with continued safe operation of our equipment. As a rule, we maintain the minimum required hazardous chemicals on-site to effectively produce fuel ethanol. FHR Fairmont actively trains employees on chemical use and handling procedures. In addition, as part of this program, FHR Fairmont went through an extensive pre-startup safety review (PSSR).\r\n\r\nFHR Fairmont is subject to several federal"

OSHA regulates worker and chemical safety, with provision of Worker Right-To-Know. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act has two annual reports requiring the tracking of chemicals stored, used and released at the facility. Waste waters are analyzed before releasing to a surface stream and are regulated under a state permit. Surface storm water runoff is collected in an on-site retention pond. FHR Fairmont maintains a spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan in addition to a storm water pollution prevention plan. The facility maintains and complies with a Title V air permit under the Clean Air Act Amendments (administered by the state of Nebraska). In addition to regulations for similar production facilities, the production of ethanol is under the purview of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which requires the facility to maintain a license and surety bond, and regulations overseen by the Department of Transportation.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding five years, there were no accidental releases with on-site or off-site consequences meeting EPA criteria for inclusion in this plan.\r\n\r\nFHR Fairmont employees are not trained as Incident Commanders under the standards of OSHA. All emergencies arising on the property owned by and under the control of FHR Fairmont will be coordinated by a company defined emergency coordinator or successor until such time as a trained Incident Commander assumes command of the emergency.\r\n\r\nIn an emergency situation, employees will be evacuated to a designated assembly area, where a head count will be taken to account for employees on duty. The emergency coordinator will also ensure that necessary notifications to Fire Departments, Police, Highway Patrol, etc. have been made.\r\n\r\nThe operations personnel will ensure that appropriate processes are shut down and deenerg"
