Flexible Foam receives raw materials at its facility, mixes the materials to produce a polyurethane foam bun on a foam production line.  The foam is then cured and stored on site prior to shipping to customers.  Some limited fabrication takes place at the facility.  \n\nOne of the components used in the production of polyurethane foam is toluene diisocyanate (TDI).  This compound is subject to EPA?s Risk Management Rule.\n\nToluene diisocyanate is delivered to the 501 Industrial Boulvard facility in tank trucks.  The trucks are off-loaded to a storage tank located inside the building.  Because the storage of TDI takes place inside the building,  the probability of release of toluene diisocyante vapors into the atmosphere is reduced.  As a result, the impact of such a release on the surrounding community is minimized.  There are no inhabited receptors (buildings and people other than the Flexible facility) that would be impacted by the release of stored or unloaded toluene diisocyanate but undeveloped property beyond the property line to the East and South would be impacted by a worst-case scenario..  \n\nBecause there are public receptors (undeveloped) and there have been no significant incidents of release in the last five years, Flexible Foam, 501 Industrial Boulevard facility is classified as a \"Program 2\" facility.\n\n\n WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\n\nChemical:\nTOLUENE DIISOCYANATE\n\nAssumptions:\n\n*    Catastrophic failure of a rail tank car, (releasing all contents within five minutes)\n\n*    Worst-case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed)\n\n*    Instantaneous release of entire contents of tank ( 20000 gallons. )\n\nDistance:    55 yards (165 feet)\n\nDescriptions:\n\nThis release scenario has a toxic level of concern end point that extends off Flexible Foam?s property to "

TOXICS:  WORST CASE  EXPLANATION\n\nSection 2.6 release rate:\n\nFlexible Foam modeled with Aloha, the release rate calculated was 0.0765 pounds per minute. Since EPA's RMP submit program does not accept any value less than 0.1, a factor of 0.1 was entered because that is the lowest number that the RMP program would accept.  Based on the modeled release rate Flexible Foam is a Program 2 facility, independent of the value entered into RMP Submit.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nFlexible Foam, Inc. takes safety very seriously.  We use safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of any release that might occur.  Some examples are:\n\n    -Regular equipment inspections and maintenance to ensure proper operation.\n    -Investigation of all incidents to improve our procedures.\n    -Secondary containment to ensure that the contents of hazardous material remain on site.\n    -Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials, Emergency Contingency Planning.\n    -Hazardous Materials Awareness Training\n    -Hazardous Materials Response Training\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nFlexible personnel are regularly trained and drilled on safety and accident prevention.  \nThe following agencies are in place to respond to a release of hazardous material.\n\n    -Terrell City Fire Department \n    -TCEQ Emergency Response Team\n\n\n\nAt the Flexible Products, Inc.

TDI is considered a toxic substance, and associated safety precautions have been implemented to (1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, (2) reduce the threat to the health of our employees at the Nu-Foam Chattanooga plant, and (3) reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by railcar and by tank truck, and is stored in two indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks and in up to two standby railcars) at our plant is about 200,000 lb.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam products are shipped to customers by truck.\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA?s risk management program (RMP) rule.  This substance is covered because the maximum quantity contained in our TDI process exce"

The OCA consists of evaluating worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios (ARS's).  We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARS?s can help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which an accidental release might affect the public (the endpoint distance).  The following could occur at the endpoint distance: Most people at the endpoint distance of a toxic substance release like TDI would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\n\n    [Note: The following sections entitled \"Worst-case release scenario\" and \"Alternative release scenario\" are similar to those contained in EPA and industry guidance documents for risk management plans (RMPlans).  The EPA has decided not to include on the Internet the OCA data submitted in sections 2 ? 5 of the RMPlan.  In January 1999, the EPA also revised its guidance on the scenario sections of the Executive Summary to delete an earlier instruction to identify the distance to the endpoints.  The current guidance remains to describe each of the plant?s scenarios but it has been revised for the plant to indicate whether the release has offsite impact.  The following scenario sections conform to this EPA guidance.]\n\nWorst-case release scenario.  \nCatastrophic failure of a TDI railcar, having a capacity "

The TDI vendors limit the quantity of TDI loaded into a railcar to a maximum of 190,000 lb to allow space for thermal expansion during possible heating of the TDI.  During hot weather, the TDI temperature could reach the maximum ambient temperature of 97  ?F.  We assumed the release would occur at 100 ?F to be conservative and allow for a margin of error in release modeling.  We also assumed that the entire contents of the railcar would be released as a liquid, form a pool that would spread to cover an area of approximately 6,307 ft2, and evaporate to form a toxic cloud that would disperse downwind.  Given the presence of nearby buildings and trees surrounding the TDI railcar, the terrain was considered more urban than rural.  Refined dispersion modeling predicts that the distance from the railcar to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 1.0 ppm (0.007 mg/L) extends beyond the plant?s property boundary and touches portions of two adjacent, undeveloped properties.  Concrete containment is used to restrict the size of the puddle from of 60,000 ft2 to about one-tenth of that area.  The installation of the containment reduced the ALOHA Model toxic cloud footprint from over 0.5 mile to 0.03 mile.\n\nAlternate release scenario.  \nRupture of the transfer line from the railcar to the TDI storage tank would release TDI to the ground at a calculated rate of 5,800 lb/min.  We assumed that the TDI temperature in the railcar is typically 85 ?F and that the railcar is pressurized with air at 30 psig to facilitate unloading.  We also assumed that the release would continue for the 20 minutes expected for an employee to be able to stop the release by closing the railcar block valve.

Our facility qualifies for Level 2 coverage because (1) our worst-case release scenario for TDI can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is exempt from OSHA?s process safety management standard, and (3) our polyurethane foam process has not been targeted by the EPA for Level 3 coverage.  Our accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n\n? Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes, and equipment\n \n? Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, processes, and procedures\n \n?

The release was not large enough to result in injuries or significant damage and was exempt from reporting requirements due to the small quantity.\n \n Emergency response program\n \n Our emergency response program is based on the requirements in OSHA?s emergency action plan regulation, OSHA?s hazardous waste and emergency operations regulation, and EPA?s emergency response program requirements in its RMP rule.  Our program includes procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  Our procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities, by using management of change procedures.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.\n \n The emergency response plan for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes providing them with a copy of the ERP and subsequent telephone call and invitation to tour the plant.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the fire department.  This p"

Our hazard review and incident investigation programs are especially designed to identify needed process safety improvements, some of which result in changes to the process.  The RMP is viewed as a living document and will be subject to revisions as appropriate, based on process changes and on-the-job evaluations of existing procedures, which will then be submitted to the Management Review Committee prior to implementation of recommended changes.\n \n Past changes to improve safety\n\n? Provided high-level alarm of the TDI and other feeds to prevent overfilling the TDI storage tanks\n \n? Revised operating procedures to resolve findings from the latest TDI process hazard review."
