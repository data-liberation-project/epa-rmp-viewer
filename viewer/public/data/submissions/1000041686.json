(Louisiana Pigment) is one of the world's newest titanium dioxide manufacturing plants, beginning production in April 1992.  The facility, located near Lake Charles, Louisiana, is comprised of a 40-acre \"state-of-the-art\" plant site with an additional 100+ acres used for parking, administrative offices, training area, and an industrial waste landfill.\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nLouisiana Pigment is dedicated to operating a manufacturing facility that maintains a strong respect for our environment and a safe work place for all employees.  Louisiana Pigment takes great pride in our efforts to continuously evaluate the operation of our process, equipment function and efficiency, and procedures, both management and process, to find ways of improving our ability to prevent accidents from occurring and to minimize the impact if the worst occurs.\n\n\n\nProcedures have been developed to enhance our ability to evaluate events that have a potential for unfavorable results.  Computer tracking databases have been purchased and developed that provide management an overall view of the process and maintenance activities. An event database has been developed to track both safety and environmental events, including the implementation of any corrective actions that have been determined by an investigative team and/or management that is necessary to prevent a reoccurrence in the future. \n\n \n\nLouisiana Pigment participates in the OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program, VPP.  Louisiana Pigment received our first OSHA Star in 2005, and successfully recertified under the program in 2010 and most recently in March 2014.\n\n  \n\nChemical Manufacture Process\n\n\n\nProduct Utilization\n\n\n\nLouisiana Pigment manufactures in excess of 150,000 metric tons per year of titanium dioxide by utilizing the chloride process.  Titanium dioxide is used in industry for generating brilliantl"

Beyond this, titanium dioxide can be found in materials such as high-quality papers, color plastics, furniture panels, textile fibers, glass, ink, porcelain, toothpaste, cosmetics, candy, food coloring, PVC, white sidewall tires, and a growing list of other items.  Plastics are transparent and acquire their gleaming whites and opacities through the addition of titanium dioxide.  Titanium dioxide also improves the physical properties of many plastics.  It absorbs ultraviolet light, making the material more resistant to weathering.\n\n\n\nManufacturing Process\n\n\n\nThe chloride process at Louisiana Pigment uses high-grade titanium ores (natural rutile, titanium ores, or synthetic rutile) to recover titanium dioxide (TiO2).  This is done by first producing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as an intermediate product, then oxidizing it to form TiO2 particles to the purity required for further processing and finishing treatment.\n\n\n\nThe two steps that most characterize the Chloride Process are the continuous chlorination of ore in the fluidized bed chlorinator and the continuous oxidation of titanium tetrachloride in the gas phase to titanium dioxide using a burner.  These two steps are completely dependent upon each other since the chlorine released by oxidation is recycled to the chlorinator.  Through the use of analytical measurement and computer control technology, it is possible to optimize essential production variables, reduce down time to a minimum, and operate machinery at maximum safety standards.  On the premise that operating conditions are kept at an optimum for every step of the chloride process, 90-95% of the titanium dioxide contained in the original ore can be recovered and used in the end product.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 a"

The resulting regulations referred to as EPA's Accident Prevention program (Risk Management Planning), required certain companies, municipalities, and industries to provide information about potential risks associated with their operations.  Louisiana Pigment assessed its operation and determined that titanium tetrachloride is stored at the facility in excess of the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nLouisiana Pigment has made a commitment to our employees and community that we will endeavor to provide a safe workplace for our employees and to conduct our business as a responsible member of our surrounding community.  In keeping with this policy, Louisiana Pigment endeavors to extend attention to risk management \"beyond our fence line.\" Louisiana Pigment's Risk Management Program and internal initiatives comprises a series of management practices that support the goal of preventing fires, explosions, accidental chemical release, and encourage safety at the plant and at home.  Louisiana Pigment is committed to the Responsible Care Guiding Principles:\n\n\n\n1.To recognize and respond to community concerns about chemicals and our operations.\n\n2.To make health, safety, and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new plants and processes.\n\n3.To operate our plants and processes in a manner that protects the environment, health, and safety of our employees, and the public.\n\n\n\nRisk Management is an interdisciplinary effort composed of Management Practices divided into four elements:\n\n\n\n1.Management Leadership\n\n2.Technology\n\n3.Facilities\n\n4.Personnel\n\n\n\nCollectively, these practices encompass process safety from the design stage through operation, maintenance, and training.

Louisiana Pigment has implemented several new programs to encourage all employees and resident contractors to have a primary role in assessing their work environment and to recommend changes.\n\n\n\n1.Survey, Consider, Analyze, and Notify (SCAN) is a program that provides all employees a method to identify and correct unsafe conditions, recommend improvements to job task, and other recommendations to improve the workplace to Management.\n\n\n\n2.Safe Track is a behavioral observation program in which employees volunteer and are trained as observers.  The observers then participated in reviewing actual job tasks completed in the field.
