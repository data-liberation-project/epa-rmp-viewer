It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe facility consists of inlet mechanical filters and separators, a skid-mounted glycol dehydration system, a skid-mounted Joule?Thomson (J-T) effect natural gas processing unit, a gas compressor, two NGL (natural gas liquids) pressure vessel storage tanks, and produced water atmospheric storage tanks. Facility inlet piping is 8? and outlet piping is 8?.\n\nThe facility receives raw natural gas from several nearby gas wells. The function of the facility is to remove liquids from the wellhead gas prior to injection of the gas into an interstate gas pipeline system. Liquids are first removed by mechanical separation. Water is then removed from the gas via glycol dehydration, and finally NGLs are removed from the gas by way of a JT-valve process. The processed natural gas is then compressed and injected into the interstate gas pipeline. The NGLs are stored onsite in two pressure vessel storage tanks for removal by truck as needed. The produced water is stored in an atmospheric storage tanks for removal by truck as needed.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Koskie Dewpoint Control Plant is implementing the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the elements of OSHA?s Process"

The plant is also implementing the elements of Williams Midstream?s System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards. Key elements of these programs include:\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nOperating Procedures: Koskie Dewpoint Control Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations.  \n\nContractors: The Koskie Dewpoint Control Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR?s): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.  \n\nMechanical Integrity: Koskie Dewpoint Control Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.  \n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices include lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in t"

The program includes Classroom, OJT, and computer-based training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  \n\nIncident Investigation:  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  \n\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable RMP / PSM / SIP procedures and regulations. \n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nNo release of a regulated substance has occurred in the last 5 years.  \n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Koskie Dewpoint Control Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.

This coordination will include attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  The Koskie Dewpoint Control Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the Cortez Fire Department. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the Cortez Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Koskie Plant has modified the design to include additional check valves & block valves and to eliminate piping pockets. In addition, the plant plans to install heat tracing to selected piping and vessels. The plant also plans to install additional process alarms. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with this process."
