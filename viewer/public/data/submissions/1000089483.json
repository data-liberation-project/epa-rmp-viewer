              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Americold hazardous material release Prevention Program in place for compliance with 40 CFR 68 RMP is based on the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 in conjunction with industry guidelines of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, IIAR. The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself.  All components in the refrigeration system are designed and installed in compliance with the industry standards of ANSI/IIAR ASHRAE, ASME and jurisdictional codes in effect at the time of construction.  In order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time, maintenance and inspections are conducted on a scheduled basis to assure system integrity and functional efficiency. Maintenance and system monitoring is accomplished by employees that are trained to follow safe work procedures when operating the equipment. Also built into the system are automated engineered safeguards that continually monitor the operating equipment to maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and detection of accidental releases.  In the event of a system upset, warning systems are in place 24/7 to alert operators of operational deviations before they become emergencies.\n\n\n\nOperator training is among the most important elements of the release prevention program.  Initially the prevention program began with the gathering of equipment information and employee involvement in the process hazard analysis PHA study.  The PHA methodology used for the study is the hazards and operability (Hazop) study.  The PHA team used this method to identify whether hazards exist and then identify the actions necessary to correct them.   Other areas of training include development of operating and maintenance procedures and safe work practices, process safety compliance audits, emergency response hands-on practice in mock spill drills and the use of personal protection equipment.   \n\n\n\nOperators receive emergency responder training in order to understand how to evaluate and manage emergency situations safely and effectively.  Release prevention begins with mitigating even the smallest of leaks that occur operationally.  These are take very seriously to avoid failures that contribute to more serious releases.  Lock-out/tag-out, pump out procedures and line opening,  procedures are very important for preventing further hazards when making even minor repairs on the system.  Employees in general also receive training for ammonia awareness for knowledge of ammonia hazards, exposure prevention and what to do in the event exposure would occur.   The emergency procedures established for the facility includes and emergency action and fire prevention  plan. \n\nFor continued improvement of the release prevention plan, internal safety audits are conducted that include reviews of safe work procedures, siting evaluations and recommendations for any deficiencies identified that affect the safety of the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n",

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nAmeriCold Logistics maintains a (safety) committee whose members are the\n\ndesignated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the action organization and\n\nnotification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be\n\nimplemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is\n\nreviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance\n\nwith the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold Zumbrota facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold\n\nstorage warehouse. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia\n\nthrough various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure\n\nvapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms. Changes in\n\npressure are directly related to changes in temperature. For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers\n\nits temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat from a\n\nroom or product. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to\n\nvaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed"
