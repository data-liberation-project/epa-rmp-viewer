DELANO FARMS  RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Delano Farms , is preparing a unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program to comply with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5, Program Level 3 Elements, and Federally Title 40 CFR Part 68) and California OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program is being prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program will promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program will enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Our program brings together several existing safety pro"

      "SummaryText": "grams which already set forth rules, procedures and practices which help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2.DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA\n We operate a commercial packinghouse of table grapes.  Our facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to seven cold rooms equipped with forced air cooling, all cold rooms for storing palleted produce.  We also have two precool rooms, and a cooled staging area.   High pressure liquid from our main receiver is piped to each refrigerated area, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure & temperature accumulator vessel.  Low temperature liquid ammonia from the accumulator vessel passes through cooling devices such as evaporator coils, where the liquid ammonia absorbs heat and vaporizes.  Low temperature & pressure gas from the cooling equipment is returned to our engine room, where it passes through a compressor.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to a water cooled condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to our receiver. \n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of two vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, we are treating our facility as a single process.\n3. Ammonia Release Scenarios\n3.1Worst Case Scenario\nOur worst case scenario is the failure of our high-pressure receiver containing 35,000 lbs of ammonia.  If this were to happen the release would not be passively mitigated because the primary receiver vessel is located outside. The ammonia would be released over a ten-minute period. Using RMP*Comp we estimate that the ammonia would travel 3.6 miles (rural conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  A map showing the area that would be affected is attached.\n\nIn our opinion, it is extremely unlikely that the worst-case scenario will ever take plac"

      "SummaryText": "e.  Our receiver meets industry standards for manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety relief valves limit the operating pressure in this vessel; and our operators are trained in the safe operation of our system. \n\n3.2Alternative Case Scenario\nOur alternative release scenario is as follows.  A solenoid valve feeding a surge tank causes a wear in a seal do to costant action. Our safety relief valves feed into large water sorption tanks, so we could not consider that as a most likely scenario as many others can.  we installed these tanks earlier this year to further prevent the possibility of an ammonia release.  We walked through our entire system looking for a possible release scenario.  We feel that our most likely release would be a <high pressure leak caused by a solenoid valve feeding a surge tank. Using the modeling program ALOHA the initial release rate can be estimated as 80 lbs/min.  We assume the leak would continue for 10 minutes until the flow of ammonia to the leak point could be stopped by isolating the valve further up the pipeline and stopping the ammonia flow.  Under this scenario 800 lbs of ammonia would be released over a time period of 10 minutes. The release would not be passively mitigated because all our valves are located on the roof. Using RMP*Comp we estimate that the ammonia would travel less than 0.2 miles (rural conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\n4.GENERAL & SPECIFIC AMMONIA RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Delano Farms , is an integral part of the overall business.  It has a system charge of approximately 60,000 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system/process is constantly being monitored b"

In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment.  In addition, an outside contractor provides services in the startup and maintenance of the tube chillers.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction.\n\nAs stated before, our ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with safety relief valves.  These valves limit the operating pressures of the entire system, and prevent failures due to overpressurization.\n5.FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nDelano Farms has not had any reportable accidents in the last five years.  \n6.EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the Cal OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, Emergency Action Plans and Federally Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response and Federally Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond Defensively to a release. Under this plan our employees will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control. Initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the HAZWOPER regulations will take place before the end of the year.  The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment.  Steps might include stopping the flow of ammonia to a leak point, or u"

Further response requiring the donning of personal protective equipment would be done in coordination an outside agency.  All response activities would be coordinated with the local fire department and the Fresno County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n7.PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAs of July 8, 1999, the time that this Executive Summary is being submitted, our Risk & Process Safety Management Plan is not complete.  The reason is that in order to do it right a lot of work must be done.  We simply do not have enough qualified employees or resources to meet the initial deadline. Our company operates seasonally and we have found that our ability to allocate managerial and operator resources to prepare this plan depends upon our workload.  In addition, we have found it necessary to obtain help from outside vendors for some critical elements, such as preparing Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams and conducting a Process Hazard Analysis.  These vendors are attempting to meet the requests of numerous facilities such as ours at the same time, and have the same problem of only a limited number of people qualified to carry out the required tasks.  Thus, these vendors are setting completion dates for plan elements that we cannot entirely control.\n\nHowever, we have prepared the following milestones and allotted times for the completion of our plan:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilestoneAllotted Time\n7 Conduct Offsite Consequence Analysis --Done\n7 Prepare RMP*Submit showing status as of 6/21/99 -- Done\n7 Collect Process Safety Information 60 days - By Sept 1, 1999\n7 Conduct Process Hazard Analysis On or around Sept 1, 1999\n7 Finish PHA documentation including Action List30 days - By Oct 1, 1999\n7 Prepare Process Prevention Program elements90 days - By Oct 1, 1999\n7 Prepare Standard Operating Procedures 90days - By Oct 1, 1999\n7 Compile all elements into Risk & Process Safety \nManagement Program, review internally, and s"
