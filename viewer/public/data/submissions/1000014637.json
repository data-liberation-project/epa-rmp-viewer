      "SummaryText": "The facility produces flatproofing materials for vehicle tires. Raw materials are delivered by truck and finished products are transported to customers by truck. The regulated process is polyurethane pre-polymer production, which is highly automated.  Two components are produced that are mixed together by the customer to create a foamed polyurethane.  The regulated substance is toluene diisocyanate.  The facility has been installed with engineered equipment to minimize spills or other releases. The process and all related storage is located indoors.  Equipment is to be maintained and operated within design specifications. This facility is not covered by the OSHA PSM program.There have been no incidents related to these operations at this facility in the past five years. Emergency response to incidents at the facility are coordinated with the local fire department.  Facility personnel respond to incidental releases that can be readily accomodated as a normal part of their job duties.  Response to a major release would be handled by a commercial emergency response company. Continuing employee training programs and investigation into additional automation are anticipated to further improve safety at this facility."
