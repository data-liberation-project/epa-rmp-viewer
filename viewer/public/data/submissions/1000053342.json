Dyno strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility. Dyno also strives to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. The facility has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is the risk management program which helps manage the risks at the facility and complies with the requirements of the EPA's Rule 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at the facility. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDyno's goal at its program 3 stationary source is accidental release prevention, while maintaining emergency response procedures to minimize consequences in the event of any such release. Dyno maintains a Process Safety Manual directing employees to process safety information in accordance with respective OSHA process safety management and EPA chemical accident prevention provisions. Dyno also maintains an Emergency Procedures Manual providing necessary information and guidelines to utilize in the event of an emergency situation resulting in accidental release of a regulated substance. Dyno's objective is to train affected employees and contractors in emergency response procedures, and requires that emergency response actions are supported by proper consideration for safety, health and welfare of employees, contractors, the surrounding community and property.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nDyno has developed a management system to oversee implementation of the risk management program elements.

Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined.\n\n\n\nDyno primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\n\n\n\nDyno periodically updates its process hazard analyses of affected units. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nDyno maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified by the Manager of Safety as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.

New employees receive basic training in Dyno operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nDyno uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Dyno has procedures in place to provide that contractors \n\n*  perform their work in a safe manner\n\n*  have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n\n*  are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n\n*  understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n\n*  understand and follow site safety rules\n\n*  inform Dyno personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \n\n\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with\n\n*  a process overview, \n\n*  information about safety and health hazards, \n\n*  emergency response plan requirements, \n\n*  safe work practices, and \n\n*  a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Dyno evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

This review provides that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to corroborate that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\n\n\n\nTraining for process maintenance activities: The owner/ operator shall train each employee involved in maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment in an overview of that process and its hazards and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to assure that the employee can perform the job tasks in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\n\n\nDyno makes use of established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures are used in order that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are completed to evaluate equipment functioning as compared to that intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Dyno incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This practice assesses suitability of new equipment for its intended use and establishes that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nDyno has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which can include contractors, will document its findings, develop recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to Dyno management for resolution. Corrective actions will be taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendation will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results will be reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\n\n\nDyno is a new site that has recently started operations; therefore, there are no relevant compliance audits to report at this time.
