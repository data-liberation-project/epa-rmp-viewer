A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\r\n\r\nTippecanoe Labs actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighborhood groups.  These panels provide feedback from the community and advise Evonik on community issues.  Evonik also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.  \r\n\r\n2.
