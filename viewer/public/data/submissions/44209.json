      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThe Gonzales Surface Water Treatment Plant (GSWTP) produces approximatley 1.84 million gallons of potable water each day for the City of Gonzales.  The plant uses approximatley 90 pounds/day of chlorine gas to purify the water.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists chlorine as a toxic substance that is potentially harmful to humans and the environment.  GSWTP stores 8000 pounds of chlorine, liqufied under pressure, in (4) 1 ton cylinders.  The EPA requires the plant to have a Risk Management Plan (RMP) because there is more than 2500 pounds of chlorine in storage.\n\nThe City of Gonzales, like the EPA, are committed to chemical safety and thus created a RMP.  This commitment starts with the City Manager, Utility Director and all of the Plant Operators.  The purpose of the RMP is to prevent any accidental reseases of chlorine gas and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The City Manager of Gonzales is responsible for the implementation and integration of the RMP.\n\nThe RMP consists of the following:\n\n* Five year accident history detailing GSWTP's accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past five years.\n* Management System for implementing and integrating the RMP.\n*Prevention Program detailing safety information, the hazard review process, operating procedures, training, equipment maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.\n* Emergence Response Program detailing emergency response procedures and accident investigation and reporting.\n* Planned action to improve safety at GSWTP.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nGSWTP has not had any \"reportable\" accidents in the past five years.  A \"reportable\" accident is one that causes a death, injury, propery damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nManagement System\n\nThe City of Gonzales already has a management system in place that ensures the implementation of this RMP.  GSWTP is a small facility and only one person, the City Manager, is responsible "

      "SummaryText": "for the RMP.  The City Manager is responsible to implement and integrate the RMP and ensure that it is communicated to everyone involved in GSWTP operations.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe GSWTP prevention program is aimed to prevent accidental chlorine release that could harm employees, the public, and the environment.  This prevention program consists of the following section:\n\nSafety information-includes documentations of MSDS sheets, equipment specifictions, codes and standards used to build, design, and operate the facility, safe upper and lower parameters in the chlorination system (such as temperature and pressure), and maximum intended inventory of chlorine.  The safety information will be updated when there is a change in any of the above information.  This information ensures that GSWTP knows the safety related aspects of the chlorination process.\n\nHazard Review-includes a checklist and \"What-if\" questions.  There are over 60 questions on the checklist and over 20 \"What-if\" questions.  The hazard review will be conducted once every five years or when there is a major change in the chlorination process.  These questions and checklist help identify hazards and safety deficiencies at the plant. \n\nOperation procedures-includes step-by-step instructions for unlading chlorine cylinders, moving cylinders, hooking up regulators, starting up the chlorinators, checks during normal operations, shutting down the chlorinators, and disconnection the chlorine cylinders.  These procedures include performing equipment inspections, consequences for deviations from the procedures, and safety precautions.  The operation procedures will be updated when there is a change in any of the procedures. \n\nTraining-includes reviewing all the employees training records, determining who needs specific training, providing training for those without proper training, and providing refresher training.  Training will be provided on an on-going basis with refresher training on the RMP at least once "

      "SummaryText": "every 3 years.\n\nMaintenance-includes reviewing the maintenance requirements for the equipment, ensureing that ll of the preventative maintenance is performed, and ensuring that only qualified contractors maintain the equipment.  A qualified outside contractor will perform an annual inspecion that includes testing all of the equipment in the chlorination process.  \n\nCompliance Audits-includes performing an audit to evaluate the effectiveness of the prevention program  An audit of the prevention program will be performed at least once every three years.\n\nIncident Investigations-includes performing investigations for all the incidents that could have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine.  These incident investigations will determine the cause of the accident, the contributing factors, and ways to improve the safety of the operation.\n\nRecommendations-includes those items that will improve the safety of the plant operations.  These recommendations will result from reviewing all aspects of the prevention program.  Corrective action will be recommended at any time a deficiency is noticed.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nGSWTP emergency response program (ERP) is aimedf to ensure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.  The response program is written into the community emergency response plan for the City of Gonzales and includes immediately informing employees on site and the public off-site (in the surrounding areas) via an alarm, and by calling 911 and the emargency response coordinator for the City of Gonzales.  The secondary causes and necessary actions to prevent other accidents.  The City Manager is responsible to ensure that the emergency response coordinator and all other parties can provide effective and adequate response to an emergency chlorine release at the plant.\n\nPlanned Ghanges to Improve Safety at GSWTP\n\nGSWTP has developed a list of changes that need to be made to further minimize the chances of an accidental chlorine release."
