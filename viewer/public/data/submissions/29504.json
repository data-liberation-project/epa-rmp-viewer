Within this program, each process is systemically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe LCCC primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations and the What-if/Checklist method for Process Hazard Analysis revalidations. The analysis are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to people associated with the process unit for comments and forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures. These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed. At the Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC), operating procedures: (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.

The training program includes both initial and refresher training.\n\nAll new operators receive ten weeks of comprehensive training before ever being assigned to a specific operating unit. This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and compressors, general overview of the process, properties and hazard substances in the process, and detailed review of complex procedures, such as, safe work practices and of emergency response. Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training material before a new employee can report to a process unit. Once a new employee reports to a particular process unit, he receives detailed training with respect to process specific procedures and for specific tasks; he is allowed to begin work in a specific operating unit.\n\nRefresher training covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and, (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Oral review and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process.

Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program. All other changes must be confirmed through a full management of change program to help ensure process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the change.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) conducts a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed in service. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure the safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service. The review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems is operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, emergency shutdown systems, and rotating equipment (pumps and compressors) in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and test, (4) correcting identified deficiencies and, (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, the equipment will be repaired in a timely manner. All outstanding deficiencies are tracked until such time a final solution has been implemented and documented.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The LCCC incorporates quality assurance into equipment purchase and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long standing safe work program in place to ensure worker safety. Examples of the program include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedures to conduct spark producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a  confined space. These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so similar incidents can be prevented"

Lake Charles Chemical Complex\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nSasol\u00bfs Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\nSasol is committed to Responsible Care\u00ae voluntary initiative for safe management of chemicals. Sasol follows the Responsible Care\u00ae Code of Management Practice, which is integral to the implementation of the Sasol Environmental, Health and Safety policies. The Responsible Care\u00ae Community Awareness Code of Management Practice and Sasol\u00bfs Community Awareness and Emergency Response policies are designed to assist emergency preparedness and for faster community right to know.\n\nSasol\u00bfs Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) located in Westlake, Louisiana uses natural gas and by-products from refinery operations to produce specialty chemicals for detergents and cosmetics. The chemical complex uses or produces several regulated flammables such as ethylene, propane, butane, propylene, ethane, butane, hydrogen, methane, and pentane. Chemicals maintained on site at the LCCC listed on the EPS\u00bfs list of toxic chemicals and are above EPS\u00bfs threshold quantity are ethylene oxide and hydrogen fluoride. Other regulated chemicals used in our process, which are stored below the threshold quantity, are sulphur dioxide and ammonia.\n\nIn February of 2001, the acquisition of CONDEA By Sasol Limited was complete.

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage the consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario. Look up tables published by the USEPA were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS) for ethylene oxide is the failure of the \u00be inch nozzle on a process line. This ARS results in the release of ethylene oxide over a 20 minute period. The 20 minute time period represents the maximum time required for unit personnel to block in, isolate, and empty the process, thus stopping the release.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for hydrogen fluoride is the failure of a \u00be inch connection on a process line. This ARS results in the release of hydrogen fluoride over a 10 minute period. The 10 minute period represents the time required to block in and isolate the process line to empty, thus stopping the release.\n\nNo credit was taken for the installed water curtain. If credit had been taken for this safety equipment, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be less than 700 feet or such that no one outside the plant boundary would be exposed to hydrogen fluoride.\n\nThe WCS (worse case scenario) associated with the release of a flammable substance involves the individual release of the largest inventory of two regulated substances, in a single vessel, (as allowed by administrative controls) of 1,3-Butadiene and Pentane. No credit was taken for active mitigation measures when evaluating these scenarios. Each inventory is assumed to vaporize and ignite, resulting in a vapour cloud explosion (VCE). The two worse case scenarios are due to different affected offsite areas.\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the LCCC over a 60 minute time period (the time required to empty the tank) is the release of pentane from a"

This release is assumed to result in a VCE.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe LCCC (Lake Charles Chemical Complex) maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the chemical complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the chemical complex.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that address known corrosion concerns and known hazards associated within inadvertent mixing of specific chemicals. For the different process areas, the chemical complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, composition, etc.). The chemical complex ensures that the processes are maintained within the limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems, and highly trained personnel.\n\nThe chemical complex also maintains an electronic database, that is accessible by both employees and contractor supervision, which provides information about the design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical classification, etc. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a"
