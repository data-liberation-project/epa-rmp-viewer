Sojos' safety and environmental policies are administered by the Maintenance Manager and Plant Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP Program.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Sojos facility is located at 201 Armour Avenue, South St. Paul, Minnesota. The facility is approximately 0.60 miles north of Interstate 484, approximately 1.17 miles west of Highway 10 and approximately 1.69 miles east of Highway 52. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban, with a mixture of mostly industrial and commercial areas. The regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia. The facility uses approximately 14,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system. The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the cold storage of pet food products. Typical operating conditions range from 4\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 181 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe Sojos ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house"

      "SummaryText": ", but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance. The facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves. All of the relief valves are tied into a common relief header that vent to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Sojos facility is under construction and will be completed at the end of November 2017, thus there is no accident history to report.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe Sojos facility has an emergency response plan in effect. The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations. In case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's response plan to respond to the situation. If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinat"

The SOJOs safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
