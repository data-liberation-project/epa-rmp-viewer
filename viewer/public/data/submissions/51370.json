The following areas are addressed in this summary:\n?    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n?    Stationary Source Activities and Regulated Substances Handled\n?    Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n?    Prevention Program\n?    Five-Year Accident History\n?    Emergency Response Program\n?    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nFalcon Trading Company is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Title19) and Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials (Title 8 Section 5189). Falcon Trading has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and includes the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\nEmergency Response\nAll employees are to report all releases of ammonia (odors) immediately.  \n\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\n\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  Falcon Trading interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury to anyone or the environment.\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to"

Any release exceeding 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia system. All releases shall result in immediately evacuating then isolating the area and calling management for instructions.\n\nThere are additional full time employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance Manager that have been trained to conduct visual inspections of the ammonia system on a regular basis. They are instructed to immediately report any condition that could result in an ammonia release.  An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks.  This activity is the core of Falcon Trading?s prevention program.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Falcon Trading Pajaro facility provides product cooling, and short-term storage for wholesale groceries.\n\nThe facilities are located in an industrial area of Pajaro on a contiguous property. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the two Plant Refrigeration Systems.  The total ammonia inventory in these two systems does not exceed the Federal but does exceed State thresholds.\n\nThe processes are direct, closed loop, stationary mechanical refrigeration systems. The processes were built prior to 1990. The ammonia equipment is located in enclosed machinery and refrigerated storage rooms.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system, in either design or operation. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Sc"

The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA?s Process Safety Management Program (PSM), EPA's Risk Management Plan and California?s Risk and Process Safety Management requirements. For simplicity all have been combined. \n\nThe Prevention Program implemented by Falcon Trading is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\nFalcon Trading Company utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to seasonal or daily startup and during operation. The procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent a release. Onsite personnel, registered engineers, industry consultants and certified refrigeration contractors as required have reviewed the equipment and procedures within this program. \n\nThis process does not meet the requirements of Program Level 1. It is subject California?s Title 19 standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the Program 3 level of compliance. \n\nKey objectives of Falcon Trading?s Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Falcon Trading.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis Element.)\n\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Emergency Response, and the Incident Investigation Elements.)\n\n4) Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the "

Falcon Trading certifies operators following successful completion of operator training and Falcon Trading's confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing Operating Procedures, Incident Investigation Team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \nSecond, all Falcon Trading direct hires and contract employees at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when procedural or mechanical changes are planned.  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, Operator Training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Falcon Trading?s Management of Change Procedures. \n \nIf a mechanical change is required for maintenance contracts, Falcon Trading has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, the use of Falcon Trading?s Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \n\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.

This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) have been implemented and properly documented by Falcon Trading personnel.  Falcon Trading has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find.

Responders will assist outside agencies during larger releases.\n\nDetailed emergency action plans have been developed to assist responding facility personnel.  All areas zones inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \n\nThe emergency response plan for all releases is to gain access to the isolation valves and shut down switches for the system with the release.
