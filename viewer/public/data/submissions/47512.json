The hazard review will be revalidated and updated once every five years following completion of the initial hazard review.\n\nOperating Procedures - Detailed and up-to-date process operating procedures have been developed and are maintained for each covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.52.

Employees are trained periodically on emergency response procedures.  \n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn an effort to improve safety and to reduce the risk of accidental releases, changes to the RMProgram and the facility have been implemented.  These improvements were identified either as risk reduction measures during the hazards review or as a result of an improved RMProgram and the dedication to an inherently safer process.\n\nInspections are believed to be the best way to ensure equipment does not malfunction and the Hazard Reviews are the best medicine for the operations guys to impress upon them how many ways they could fail if they don\u00bft pay attention."

      "SummaryText": "A.  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFlexible Foam Incorporated is a flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing facility located in High Point, North Carolina.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (10,000 pounds).  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 2 requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations. \n\nTDI is delivered to the facility via railcars and offloaded into storage tanks.  In the process, TDI is used in the production of polyurethane foam. The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide which is formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n \nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Flexible Foam\n\nFlexible Foam is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of TDI are documented in the Section 7 of the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform the following offsite consequence analyses.\n\u00bf One worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated toxic substances held in excess of the threshold quantity.  A worst-case scenario was conducted for TDI.\n\u00bf One alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in excess of the threshold quantity.  An alternat"

Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  Within the past five years, Flexible Foam has had no accidents that meet these requirements.\n\nE. Prevention Program Elements\n\nManagement System - Flexible Foam has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) to a qualified individual or position of responsibility.  It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\nSafety Information - Up-to-date process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.48, including the following:\n\u00bf The MSDS for TDI that contains toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process flows.\n\u00bf Block flow diagrams for the covered process.\n\u00bf Process chemistry and maximum intended inventory data for the covered process.\n\u00bf Safe operating limits and evaluation of consequences of deviations from these limits for the covered process.\n\u00bf Covered process equipment information consisting of materials of construction; piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs); electrical classification; relief system design and design basis; ventilation system design; design codes and standards employed; and safety systems (interlocks, detection or suppression systems).\n\nHazard Review - A hazard review has been performed for the TDI processes at Flexible Foam in accordance with 40 CFR 68.50.

Documentation is maintained for each employee to ensure that he or she received and understood the required training.\n\nMaintenance - A maintenance program has been developed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.56 for covered process equipment.  Employees involved in the maintenance of covered processes receive additional training, which includes an overview of the process, its hazards, and applicable procedures to ensure that the employee can perform the job in a safe manner.\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to ensure that covered process equipment is properly maintained, tested, and inspected at regular, scheduled intervals and that such activities are thoroughly documented.
