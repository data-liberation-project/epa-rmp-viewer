Londonderry Freezer Warehouse is located at 219 Rockingham Road, Londonderry, NH\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSES POLICIES\n\nLondonderry Freezer Warehouse has several different preventative procedures in place that all employees must adhere to before working at the facility to minimize accidental releases.  Every employee must participate in awareness training and operating and maintenance training for their particular duties, and responsibilities prior to working on any assignment. If any processes change, employees will be retrained in the new process before working on an assignment.\n\n\n\nContract employees are required to be properly trained in the safety programs before doing any work at the facility. \n\n\n\nAll employees who operate, service, or maintain the ammonia refrigeration systems must be trained and understand the safety and health hazards of the refrigerant and the refrigeration system at the facility. This knowledge is necessary for the protection of the individual, the other employees, and the community. All involved employees must be trained in the following general topics:\n\n\n\n?    Understanding how to read MSDS forms,\n\n?    Knowing and understanding first aid for ammonia exposure,\n\n?    Location and use of emergency equipment (eyewash, showers, and PPE),\n\n?    Routine refrigeration system operation,\n\n?    Emergency refrigeration system operation,\n\n?    Emergency and normal refrigeration safety procedures, and\n\n?    Individual's role in the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Londonderry Freezer Warehouse personnel are expected to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel to assure successful resolution of any emergency.

Londonderry Freezer Warehouse only stores one regulated substance on site above the threshold limitation, which is anhydrous ammonia.  The threshold limit for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs.  Currently the facility contains in its system an estimated 14,600 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n    \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe EPA's RMP prevention program includes the requirements of the OSHA PSM standards.  Londonderry Freezer Warehouse currently has a Process Safety Management (PSM) program at their facility. The objective of the PSM program is to prevent accidental chemical releases and minimize their impact if they do occur.  The focuses of the RMP and the PSM programs are to protect the employees and surrounding public.  The EPA only requires twelve (12) of the fourteen (14) elements of the PSM to be included in the RMP.  The following twelve (12) elements are incorporated into the prevention programs for Londonderry Freezer Warehouse:\n\n\n\no    Process Safety Information\n\no    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\no    Operating Procedures\n\no    Training\n\no    Mechanical Integrity\n\no    Management of Change\n\no    Pre-Startup Review\n\no    Compliance Audits\n\no    Incident Investigation\n\no    Employee Participation\n\no    Hot Work Permit\n\no    Contractors\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTIAL HISTORY\n\nWhen an RMP is first submitted to the EPA, it must contain five years of accident history.  The five-year history involves reporting any significant accidental releases of one or more of the regulated substances from a covered pro"

Appendix D contains the blank accident history forms to fill out.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIt is the policy of the Londonderry Freezer Warehouse facility management to implement the requirements of the Emergency Action Plan by managing and operating the facility in accordance with applicable regulations and general good operating practices. The objective is to minimize the risk of a fire, or an accidental hazardous material release, including anhydrous ammonia. Facility management has developed the Emergency Action Plan to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\n\n\n\nLondonderry Freezer Warehouse personnel are expected to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel as directed by the emergency response management to assure successful resolution of any emergency. Londonderry Freezer Warehouse employees are trained in emergency response for defensive measures only and rely on outside agencies to provide support in responding to an emergency.  Outside support is for both fire response and response to an ammonia release.  Therefore, Londonderry Freezer Warehouse is a non-responding facility and has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employees safety as required by the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nIMPROVEMENTS TO SAFETY\n\nNo changes are planned at this time.\n\n"
