If an accidental release should occur, the facility staff are prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Consolidated Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nES - 2.0    FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe Facility is a bulk, hydrocarbon storage and handling facility that receives LPG by tank cars and trucks. The liquefied petroleum gas is stored in the facility's 16 aboveground, pressurized storage tanks prior to being loaded into DOT approved delivery trucks (including those owned by Kiva Energy as well as third-party distributors). \n\n\n\n-The 16 tanks are interconnected into four groups of four vessels. Each group of four tanks is operated as if it were a single storage vessel. Those vessels are\n\n\n\n*  A-Bank-1 : A-Bank-4; \n\n*  B-Bank-1 : B-Bank-4; \n\n*  C-Bank-1 : C-Bank-4; and\n\n*  D-Bank-1 : D-Bank-4. \n\n\n\n-An LPG vapor compressor is used to create a pressure differential between the tank cars or trucks being unloaded and the receiving vessels. The differential pressure \"pushes\" the LPG from the tank cars or trucks into the storage vessels. \n\n\n\n-The LPG stored in the 30,000-gallon, aboveground storage tanks (identified below) is transferred to DOT approved LPG transportation trucks of approximately 11,000 gallons or smaller bobtail LPG delive"

Administrative controls limit the tank fill capacity to in accordance with NFPA 58 7.4.3.2(B).\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario. The worst-case release scenario is the release of LPG from a bank of four (4) storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount . The scenario assumes a complete release of 430,440 pounds of LPG gas.

The blast has the potential to impact as many as 446 residents. There are no sensitive receptors, environmental or otherwise, within this blast zone.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario. The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a catastrophic release from a full-sized (11,000-gallon\n\nwater capacity), tanker truck. This scenario assumes that the tanker leaks from the bottom mounted entry valve and that the entire contents of the truck are released to the atmosphere. The scenario assumes a complete release of 39,457 pounds of LPG gas. The alternative release scenario would produce a pressure wave with an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch gauge over atmospheric pressure that would extend 0.3 miles (0.48 kilometers). The blast would have the potential to impact as many as 50 residents. The resulting pressure wave has the potential to impact nearby businesses within this blast radius. \n\n\n\nES - 4.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\n\nSafety Information:  Kiva Energy keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.
