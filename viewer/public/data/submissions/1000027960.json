      "SummaryText": "A.  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAdvanced Comfort Products, Inc. (formerly Flexible Foam Products, Incorporated) is a flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing facility located in High Point, North Carolina.  A Name and ownership change occurred on February 19, 2014 as the result of a merger.  Advanced Comfort Products, Inc. changed its name to Innocor Foam Technologies - ACP, Inc. in 2015.  This was a name change only and the ownership, management and plant operations have remained the same.  \n\n\n\nAs a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (10,000 pounds).  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 2 requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations. \n\n\n\nTDI is delivered to the facility via railcars and offloaded into storage tanks.  In the process, TDI is used in the production of polyurethane foam. The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide which is formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n\n \n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Flexible Foam\n\n\n\nFlexible Foam is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of TDI are documented in the Section 7 of the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n\n\nC.

One worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated toxic substances held in excess of the threshold quantity.  A worst-case scenario was conducted for TDI.\n\nA?A? One alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in excess of the threshold quantity.  An alternative scenario was calculated for TDI.\n\n\n\nMore detailed information is provided in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMPlan. \n\n\n\n\n\nD. Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  Within the past five years, Flexible Foam has had no accidents that meet these requirements.\n\n\n\nE. Prevention Program Elements\n\n\n\nManagement System - Flexible Foam has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMP program) to a qualified individual or position of responsibility.  It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\n\n\nSafety Information - Up-to-date process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.48, including the following:\n\nA?A? The MSDS for TDI that contains toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process flows.\n\nA?A? Block flow diagrams for the covered process.\n\nA?A? Process chemistry and maximum intended inventory data for the covered process.\n\nA?A? Safe operating limits and evaluation of consequences of deviations from these limits for the covered process.\n\nA?A? Covered process equipment information consisting of"

The hazard review was performed using What-If/ Checklists.  The hazard review identified the hazards associated with the regulated substance in the TDI process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases.  Any issues identified during the hazard review were documented and will be resolved in a timely manner.  The hazard review will be revalidated and updated once every five years following completion of the initial hazard review.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - Detailed and up-to-date process operating procedures have been developed and are maintained for each covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.52.  Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process.  Operating procedures are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain current and accurate.\n\nOperating procedures cover each operating phase of the covered process including initial system startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and conditions when required, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.  Operating procedures also incorporate or reference relevant process safety information including the following:\n\nA?A? Process Operating Limits (including consequences of deviations and steps to correct or avoid such deviations).\n\nA?A? Safety and heal"

The training includes an overview of the process and emphas process operating procedures, safe work practices, health and safety hazards, and emergency operations including shutdown.  Those employees already involved in operating or maintaining a covered process prior to 21 June 1999 have been certified in writing as having \"the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities as specified in the operating procedures\".\n\nRefresher training is provided at a minimum of every three years to all employees involved in working with a covered process.  Documentation is maintained for each employee to ensure that he or she received and understood the required training.\n\n\n\nMaintenance - A maintenance program has been developed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.56 for covered process equipment.  Employees involved in the maintenance of covered processes receive additional training, which includes an overview of the process, its hazards, and applicable procedures to ensure that the employee can perform the job in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to ensure that covered process equipment is properly maintained, tested, and inspected at regular, scheduled intervals and that such activities are thoroughly documented.

Documentation of first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental exposures; and\n\nA?A? Procedures for emergency response after and accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nThe emergency response plan is reviewed annually to reflect changes at the facility and ensure that employees are informed of the changes.  The emergency response program includes procedures for the use of on-site emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance.  Employees are trained periodically on emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nIn an effort to improve safety and to reduce the risk of accidental releases, changes to the RMP program and the facility have been implemented.  These improvements were identified either as risk reduction measures during the hazards review or as a result of an improved RMP program and the dedication to an inherently safer process.\n\n\n\nInspections are believed to be the best way to ensure equipment does not malfunction and the Hazard Reviews are the best medicine for the operations guys to impress upon them how many ways they could fail if they do not pay attention.  Different inspections of the TDI process systems are performed daily, weekly and monthly."
