These improvements were identified either as risk reduction measures during the hazards review or as a result of an improved RMP program and the dedication to an inherently safer process.\r\n\r\nInspections are believed to be the best way to ensure equipment does not malfunction and the Hazard Reviews are the best medicine for the operations guys to impress upon them how many ways they could fail if they do not pay attention.

(formerly Flexible Foam Products, Incorporated) is a flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing facility located in High Point, North Carolina.  A Name and ownership change occurred on February 19, 2014 as the result of a merger.  Advanced Comfort Products, Inc. changed its name to Innocor Foam Technologies - ACP, Inc. in 2015.  This was a name change only and the ownership, management and plant operations have remained the same.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (10,000 pounds).  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 2 requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations. \r\n\r\nTDI is delivered to the facility via railcars and offloaded into storage tanks.  In the process, TDI is used in the production of polyurethane foam. The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide which is formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\r\n \r\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Flexible Foam\r\n\r\nFlexible Foam is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of TDI are documented in the Section 7 of the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\r\n\r\nC.

An alternative scenario was calculated for TDI.\r\n\r\nMore detailed information is provided in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMPlan. \r\n\r\n\r\nD. Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  Within the past five years, Flexible Foam has had no accidents that meet these requirements.\r\n\r\nE.
