This facility conforms to the laws and regulations of the state of Nebraska. Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to agricultural production customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer. This facility location (Plant 2) has three anhydrous ammonia storage tanks with a combined capacity of 28,000 gallons water capacity and 18 anhydrous nurse tanks with a capacity of 1000 gallons water capacity each, for a total facility storage capacity of 46,000 gallons water capacity. Three storage tanks, the anhydrous nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation. The facility operates with normal business hours during the spring and fall seasons.\n\n\n\nThe off site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case\" release and \"alternative\" release scenarios. The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break. The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\n\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the tank releasing the entire 120,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The off site consequences were calculated using \"TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers.\" The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per se"

      "SummaryText": "cond with an \"F\" atmospheric stability class. A rural topography was selected as typical. The distance to the endpoint was 5.60 miles.  It is estimated that 2,074 people would be affected by this release.\n\n\n\nThe \"alternative\" release scenario assumes a 1 1/2 inch hose breaks and leaks 7,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario. Using rural topography and \"TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers\" the toxic endpoint is 1.20 miles. The population within that area is estimated to be 1,019 people. The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.\n\n\n\nKruger Feed and Seed has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years. Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\n\n\nKruger Feed and Seed has several key elements in their accident prevention plan:\n\n1.  The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Nebraska.\n\n2.  Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards.\n\n3.  Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n\n4.  Annual inspections include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n\n5.  Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\n\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change. Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safety to the operators and to the community."
