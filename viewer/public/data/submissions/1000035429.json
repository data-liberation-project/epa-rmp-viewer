      "SummaryText": "Dart Container Corporation of Horse Cave Kentucky uses iso-butane as the blowing agent in its DI foam extrusion process.  Iso-butane is a flamable liquid.  The iso-butane is stored in a pressurized above ground storage tank.  There are are sniffers in all areas where liquid iso-butane is handled to detect leaks.  Interlocks are used to shut down the process if concentrations get to unsafe levels (50 % LEL inside and 25 % LEL outside).  As required Dart also has standard operating prodeducres and training in place to instruct operators on how to safely handle iso-butane.  There is a written SPCC plan that addresses iso-butane spills and a written emergency response plan that addresses activities and actions that need to be taken in response to a release, fire, and/or explosion.  Evacuation drills are completed on a yearly basis for all personel on site.  Dart has had no major spills of iso-butane.  Dart also has polystrene extrusion and foam molding operations located on this site which do not use a flammable liquid.  \n\n\n\nThe maxmum amount of iso-butane on site is 205353 pounds (30000 gallons which is the tank ).  The worst case release senario involves a rupture of the tank with a release of a vapor cloud that then ignites.  The area of impact would include all areas within .5 miles of the tank according to EPA's \"Offsite Consequences Analysis Guidelines\".  There are a few residential houses across the street from the plant that would fall within this impact range.  The alternate release sceneria involves a transfer hose failure which would release the tank truck contents during a fill on to the ground.  All offloading is monitored by Dart personnel, however, in the event that a undetected release occurs for approximately 20 minutes at a rate of 100 GPM, vaporization would occur and a .3 mile radiuos would be affected (EPA's RMP Comp modeling).  \n\n\n\n"
