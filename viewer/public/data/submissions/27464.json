              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR CHLORINE\n\nRailroad Tank Car Unloading\n\n     There are two locations for chlorine tank cars, but chlorine is drawn from only one car at a time, and the valves on the other tank car are closed.  There are also two liquid-chlorine headers from each tank-car spot, and one of the headers is disconnected from the chlorine supply while the other header is in use.  The headers are switched annually for inspection and preventive maintenance.\n\n     The chlorine is usually unloaded using the autogenous (vapor) pressure, but air which is dried to -40C (to prevent corrosion) at about 100 psig is used during the winter or when the tank car is nearly empty.\n\n     In addition to the 15,000-pounds-per-hour excess-flow valve in each tank car, remote-operated valves are installed at each end of each unloading hose, to block liquid-chlorine flow from the tank car in an emergency.  Shut-off is actuated from the bleaching-area control room in response to an alarm signal from any of the four chlorine sensors (two at each car spot, and set at 1 part per million), or in response to observation and communication from a nearby telephone.   Check valves are installed at each end of the air hose to the tank-car vapor space, to prevent backflow of chlorine vapor from the tank car.  An expansion tank is installed on each header to protect the piping from excessive pressure, in the unlikely event that the valves at each end of the header were to be closed.\n\n     The mechanic who connects and disconnects a chlorine tank car wears an airline mask, and he is assisted by a second employee who is similarly equipped.  Self-contained breathing apparatuses [SCBA] are readily available.\n     \nPaper-Pulp Bleaching\n\n     The liquified chlorine is vaporized in either of two hot-water-heated evaporators, and the pressure downstream of the evaporators is automatically reduced to about 35 psig.  The gaseous chlorine is injected at manually-controlled rates into water streams which flow into the pulp-bleaching tanks.\n\n     Eleven chlorine detectors in and around the evaporators and bleaching process actuate an alarm at 1  ppm and automatically shut off the flow of chlorine from the evaporators.  Three switches and a radio control also can be used to stop the chlorine flow.\n\n     Six 10-minute escape masks are provided in the evaporator area, and two escape masks and two SCBA are provided in the nearby constantly-attended control room.\n\nOther Uses\n\n     Gaseous chlorine is also used to water in a mill reservoir and to prevent the growth of \"slime\" at the paper machines.\n\nCaustic Scrubber\n\n     A large scrubber draws air from the bleaching tanks, to remove any residual chlorine from the air before discharge to the atmosphere.  The rupture disks on the evaporators also discharge to this scrubber.  A chlorine sensor in the discharge stack actuates an alarm at 1 ppm, to notify the operator that the strength of the caustic needs to be increased.  An \"ORP\" sensor in the caustic stream to the top of the scrubber also sounds an alarm if the concentration of the caustic is too low.  Failure of the exhaust blower stops the flow of chlorine to the bleaching process.\n\nProcess-Safety Program\n\n     All bleach-plant operators and mechanics have been thoroughly trained in the handling of chlorine, with the assistance of the chlorine supplier.  Equipment is maintained accoring to a preventive maintenance schedule.  Emergency and evacuation plans have been developed and have been tested twice each year.  The chlorine system has been subjected to intensive process hazards analysis, with periodic updating.  Any changes to the process are studied for possible safety implications, prior to the change.  Details of the process safety information, process hazards analysis, and risk and consequence analysis are available in reports dated 1990 and 1995.",

This Executive Summary describes the processes that are used at this facility and the precautions that are taken to prevent the escape or release of noxious materials.\n\nFacility Description\n\n     The Spotswood mill occupies the area between Main Street and Duhernal Lake, in Spotswood, New Jersey, and consists of 22 buildings, including administrative offices, processing buildings, and warehouses.  One of the processes (bleaching) involves a regulated chemical - chlorine.  Although this chemical is toxic and an oxidizer, special procedures and controls are used in its handling and processing.  As a result, there have been no serious incidents involving chlorine in the past five years.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nChlorine is received in railroad tank cars that are approved by the U. S. Department of Transportation and have capacities of 90 tons.  It is theoretically possible - but highly unlikely (because of the tank-car construction and safety devices) - that a tank car could rupture, and such an incident would be considered a \"worst-case\" scenario.  To determine the maximum number of persons who possibly could be affected, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency [USEPA] requires that the consequences of such an incident be determined, as is done in this Registration Report.\n\n     As a result of the moderately-congested area in which the Spotswood mill is located, the toxic effects of a \"worst-case\" release could affect the nearby residents and businesses.  To determine the consequences of the \"worst-case\" release, the USEPA \"Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" is used, together with a census program called \"Landview\".  Among the features which are provided to"

With the close control of transfers and processes, such releases are unlikely and would be stopped promptly.  As a result, it is unlikely that the public or the environment would be affected.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs\n\n     Operations involving chlorine at the Spotswood mill are regulated by the \"Process Safety Management\" standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and by the \"Accidental Release Prevention\" standard of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency.  To comply with these standards, the Spotswood mill follows strict guidelines for operating procedures, training of employees, analysis of processes for potential hazards, preventive maintenance programs, emergency plans, and investigation of incidents, with employee participation in this process safety effort.  In addition, the Spotswood mill has been involved in the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act [NJTCPA] and program since 1990, with annual reviews of the chlorine processes and with two process-safety audits by an outside consultant since that date.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n     There has been one incident involving release of chlorine in the past five years, on August 12, 1994.  The incident invoved the release of less than ten pounds of \"trapped\" chlorine through a relief valve that had been installed to prevent overpressure damage to piping and equipment in event of such an incident.  There were no on-site injuries or off-site effects as a result of this incident. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n     As a part of the NJTCPA program, the Spotswood mill has conducted two emergency-response drills every year since"

These drills involved the Spotswood Police Department, the Spotswood Fire Department (which comprises the Local Emergency Planning Committee), as well as employees who are trained to recognize and respond to the simulated emergency situations and to actuate shutdown and other protective systems.  Annual tours are arranged for members of the Fire Dapartment, to show the locations of the chlorine unloading facilities and fire-protection systems.  A weather station is maintained on-site, to provide information to local authorities regarding the protection of occupants of residences and business establishments in the downwind direction, if necessary.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n     Automatic shutoff of the valves at each end of the unloading hoses, in response to detection of chlorine leakage, is being considered as a measure to further reduce the risk to employees and the public."
