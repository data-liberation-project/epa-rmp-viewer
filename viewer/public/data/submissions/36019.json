If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Wesley Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency.  Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the North Central Regional Planning District will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned.  In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT GOLD-EAGLE COOPERATIVE, WESLEY, IOWA:\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.  the anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe system consists of two (2) 11,000-gallon (old rail cars), one (1) 18,000-gallon, and one (1) 26,000-gallon storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure one (1) of the 26,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85%"

According to EPA's RMP comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 3.6 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nGold-Eagle Cooperative (formerly The Farmers Cooperative Society), Wesley, Iowa has not experienced any accidental release involving anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Gold-Eagle Cooperative to immediately notify the Wesley volunteer Fire Department to request that they respond to the emergency.  In the unlikely event that the Wesley Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Wesley location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Wesley has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and they have inspected our anhydrous ammonia facilities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThere are no planned changes of our procedures or policies."
