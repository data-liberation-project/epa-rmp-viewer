The Water Plant currently treats an average of 3.0 MGD and uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant in the treatment process.  The City uses approximately 150 pounds per day of chlorine in their prechlorination and postchlorination facilities.  The Water Treatment Plant utilizes ton chlorine cylinders manifolded in pairs with a backup pair to provide the supply chlorine.  Additionally, the Plants stores two to four reserve non-connected cylinders to replace chlorine cylinders in service as they are depleted.  Typically no more than 10,000 pounds of chlorine are on the site at any time.\n\nThe City of Pulaski Water Treatment Plant has developed this Risk Management Program in an attempt to identify all possible chemical emergencies which may occur and the best way to prevent the accidental release of chlorine to the atmosphere from the plantA?s chlorination facilities.  The City Personnel responsible for the daily maintenance and operation of the chlorination equipment conduct their work with the utmost professionalism and have a deep respect of the dangers involved with chlorine.  The City places chlorine safety ahead of all other matters.\n\nThe City's Process Safety Management (PSM) plan has been coordinated with the Giles County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the City of Pulaski Safety Board to assure that all entities are aware of the possible dangers involved in a chlorine leak from the Water Treatment Plant.  The City has developed a written operations manual, emergency response plan and emergency action plan as part of the OSHA PSM plan.  As a part of the written operations manual, City personnel always proceed with work with at a safe pace and double check all connections when changing tanks or adjusting the system.

Upon detection of the leak, the plant supervisor will notify the emergency service coordinator as defined in the City of PulaskiA?s Emergency Operations Plan to coordinate assistance with outside emergency units.  The cause of the leak will then be determined so that appropriate actions may be taken to insure public safety.  The City of Pulaski Fire Department will act as standby rescue personnel for the plant operators while an attempt to stop the chlorine leak is made.  The fire department personnel will be familiarized with the chlorine system so as to assure that, if necessary, they may be able to isolate the leak and stop it.  The Emergency Service Coordinator will work with the Pulaski Police Department and other personnel to alert nearby residents to remove to safety if the need arises.  Local radio stations may also be utilized to notify the public of the emergency condition and what to do.\n\nTo date, the City of Pulaski has had no major accidental releases of chlorine which required action involving off-site receptors.  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\nA training session will be conducted at the end of the PSM review to inform plant personnel of the proper methods for reporting accidents and proper operational methods to minimize the chance of accidental release of chlorine.\n\n"
