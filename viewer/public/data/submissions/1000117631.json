      "SummaryText": "Sargento Cheese, Inc., in Plymouth, Wisconsin is home to Sargento headquarters and houses the main distribution center. Production lines at the plant process a variety of dairy products. Processes conducted at the Plymouth facility include high speed slicing with zip closure packaging, vertical form/fill/seal shred packaging with zip closures, diced and cubed cheese in zip closure packaging. This plant is situated on a 65-acre parcel of land near the northwestern limits of the City of Plymouth. Adjacent properties to the south are industrial and commercial, to the west are residential and to the north and east are rural residential.\n\nThe facility has a basic single-stage mechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. There are two separate ammonia systems at the facility, with the compressors in two separate mechanical rooms. The original system (referred to as the \u0093West\u0094 Ammonia Refrigeration System) was constructed in 1993 to 1994, and the new system (referred to as the \u0093East\u0094 Ammonia Refrigeration System) was constructed in 2005. The systems are completely independent of each other. The total maximum intended inventory of ammonia in the West System is approximately 13,451 pounds, and the total maximum intended inventory of ammonia in the East System is approximately 16,579 pounds. Both ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and installed in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code Department of Safety and Professional Services Chapter 345, ASTM standards, and ASHRAE 15. The facility is equipped with alarm and ammonia detection systems, which continually monitor the refrigeration system. Also, Sargento ammonia technicians conduct routine inspections of the ammonia systems.\n\nThe ammonia system at Sargento - Plymouth is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) which requires the facility to manage system operations and develop emergency response and accident prevention"

The facility is also required to comply with EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program (RMP). The RMP rule, found in 40CFR68, uses a tiered approach for its risk management requirements. The Sargento \u0096 Plymouth facility requires a Program 3 RMP Plan, because it is also regulated under the PSM program.\n\nThe program requirements under the RMP and PSM programs include safety information, hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits and contractor management. Both programs require a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The most recent 5-year PHA was conducted in April 2022. In addition, the RMP program includes an offsite consequence analysis, a management system, and emergency response planning.\n\nSargento is committed to protecting the health and well-being of their employees, the community, and the environment. Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia awareness training and emergency action procedures for all employees, annual training for the spill response teams, annual response training for the maintenance personnel and ammonia system training for the ammonia technicians. Training schedules are handled promptly by the Plant Safety Professional. The facility has a chemical labeling program and a spill prevention plan. Outside contractors must follow written contractor policies. Hot work permits and lockout/tagout procedures are required.\n\nSargento has never had an accident involving the ammonia system that caused deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. If an emergency were to occur, the local community fire and hazardous response team would be notified, and the emergency response procedures would be followed. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan, and emergency drills are carried out each year. Each s"

The Sheboygan County Local Emergency Planning Committee has an offsite plan for the ammonia system. Sheboygan County utilizes a community alert system, which in the event of an emergency will alert the community. The local response teams are invited to visit the Sargento Plymouth Facility each year. The last tabletop exercise with emergency responders was completed in the fall of 2023. Coordination between Sargento and the Sheboygan County Local Emergency Planning Committee takes place annually. \n\nSargento is committed to continuous improvement of its facilities, including the ammonia systems contained within. Improvements to the east engine room and ammonia system have commenced to allow for future expansion of the system and improve maintainability. This work includes the expansion of the engine room and upsizing of a pressure vessel. Also, to improve awareness of our PSM/RMP program, Sargento has developed training for new stakeholders and key personnel of the PSM/RMP regulated processes."
