      "SummaryText": "1. Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Midwest Farmer's Co-Operative (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the faciltiy is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grad fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one storage tank of 12,000 gallons.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 229,950 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\nA. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,530 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.8 miles.\n\nB. The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a 1 1/2-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 7,200 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .92 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards "

    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 35046,
      "SummaryText": "of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe condtions.\n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
