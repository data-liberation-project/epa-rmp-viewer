      "SummaryText": "1.  FACILITY POLICY.  The owners, management and employees of United Supplers are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occure, the facilty is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.  The primary activity at this location is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to Retail Agriculture Dealers and Farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and blended into 10-34-00 fertilizer.  This blending operation takes place twice a year, normally during one week in the spring and one week in the fall.  This blending operation is performed by a T-Reactor.  The T-Reactor process is a method of producing fertilizer composed of nitrogen and phosphorous.  The Nitrogen is supplied to the process in the form of anhydrous ammonia.  Phosphorous is supplied as wet=process superphosphoric acid.  Water is the other raw material and is used to dilute the plant nutrients to stable, standard grades of commercial fertilizer.  The standard grades produced by this process are 10-34-00 and 11-37-00.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia on hand during the blending operation would be approximateldy 150,000 pounds.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a railroad tank car.  The maximum quantity would be approximately 150,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 4.4 miles.\n\n4.  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a transfer hose connection.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.9 miles.\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61\", Published by the American National Standards Institure, Inc., and th"

The facility has in place Standard Safe Operating Procedures for T-Reactors Process which employees have been trained to follow.\n\n6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.  Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFAETY.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess our prevention and safety programs.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations at this time.\n\n9.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\n     Cliff Daugherty\n     United Suppliers, Inc.\n     P. O.
