The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce theprobability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed with the USEPA and  Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCarson Energy Group is the contract operator of a cogeneration facility, SCA II Cogeneration Plant, located at 5000 - 83rd St., Sacramento, CA in Sacramento County, owned by Sacramento Cogeneration Authority.  Aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) is used for selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides in the gas  turbine exhaust.  This RS is handled  in quantities greater than its Federal threshold quantity.  The facility is located"

      "SummaryText": " in an industrial area in south Sacramento with few residences nearby.  There are 10 full-time employees at this site.  Aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) is received in bulk by truck into an enclosed steel storage tank.  The aqueous ammonia solution is pumped from the storage tank at a metered rate into the flowing turbine exhaust gas at the location of a catalyst within the exhaust duct, and reacts chemically with oxides of nitrogen to form nitrogen gas, thus reducing air pollutant emissions in  the stack gas. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Carson Energy Group that the receipt, storage and handling of aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) at the SCA II Cogeneration Plant be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Carson Energy Group has gathered safety information on aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) and on the process, equipment and procedures involving aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution); performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Carson Energy Group are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\nCarson Energy Group maintains policies and procedures conforming to recognized industry standards  covering the operation and maintenance of its selective catalytic "

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Carson Energy Group's operations at the SCA II Cogeneration Plant. Carson Energy Group has established written program and document management procedures as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCarson Energy Group's Emergency Response Program applicable to aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies.  First Responders have participated with Carson Energy Group personnel in response drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Carson Energy Group committed to accomplish have been completed.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
