      "SummaryText": "HVUD Risk Management Plan - Executive Summary 2014\n\n\n\nThe Harpeth Valley Utilities District (HVUD) owns and operates a 51 million gallon per day water treatment facility located on the Cumberland River southwest of Nashville, Tennessee.  This water treatment plant provides potable water to portions of Davidson, Williamson, and Cheatham counties in Tennessee.  The treatment process involves disinfection of pathogenic organisms in the water using chlorine.  To provide this capability, the water treatment plant at HVUD has a chemical storage and feed building constructed to handle and feed chlorine in the treatment process.  Presently this facility can store and feed up to 16 one-ton containers of chlorine gas (32,000 lbs.).\n\n\n\nThe release scenarios used in the HVUD Risk Management Program are:\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nBased on a catastrophic break in a 1-ton cylinder.\n\nRelease Rate:         200 lbs/Min.\n\nRelease Duration:     10 Minutes\n\nDistance to Endpoint:     1.3 Miles (Based on \"F\" Stability and Wind Speed = 1.5 \n\n                                    meters/sec.)\n\n\n\nAlternative Release:\n\n\n\nBased on a 5/16\" hole developing in connection piping from cylinder to header.\n\nRelease Rate:         240 lbs./min.\n\nRelease Duration:    8.3 Minutes\n\nDistance to Endpoint:    0.3 miles (based on \"D\" Stability and Wind Speed = 3 meters/sec.)\n\n\n\nThe administrative controls in place at HVUD to limit the release of chlorine gas include the following:\n\n\n\n?    The chlorine storage area is properly labeled with signage outside the entrances.\n\n?    All entrances to chlorine areas are locked.  HVUD policy allows no one but \n\n        authorized employees and properly trained and authorized contractors to enter \n\n        this area.\n\n?    Safe operational procedures have been developed for use in our chlorine storage \n\n        and feed areas.  HVUD Operators are trained on these procedures and utilize them.  \n\n?    Alarms are in place and tested regularly.  \n\n\n\nPhysical mitigation measures in place to limit the rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease of chlorine gas include the following:\n\n\n\n?    A two-ton dry medium chlorine gas scrubber is in place and ready for use.  This \n\n        scrubber could contain the worst case and alternate release scenarios described \n\n        above.\n\n?    Automatic Shut-Off Valves are installed at each one-ton chlorine container.  \n\n        These valves would be utilized in concert with the dry medium scrubber to greatly \n\n        reduce the chance of an accidental release of chlorine gas.       \n\n?    The chlorine storage area and chlorination room are enclosed and will allow the \n\n        scrubber to evacuate both areas without allowing chlorine gas to enter the \n\n        outside atmosphere.\n\n?    In the event of a leaking cylinder outside the chlorine storage area, emergency \n\n        response procedures in effect at HVUD call for moving the cylinder inside so that \n\n        the scrubber can then remove the chlorine gas.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nHVUD is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management rule as well as the EPA Risk Management Program.  Our general accidental release prevention program includes regular maintenance of our chlorine handling equipment and regular training of our operational personnel in the safe operation procedures established by the program.  In addition, HVUD maintains a chlorine response team comprised of personnel trained to the 24 Hour Response Technician Level (HAZWOPER).  We maintain the appropriate response equipment, including SCBA's, level A suits, and emergency leak kits for one ton cylinders.  The HVUD Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the Metro Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), and we maintain a presence at meetings held by MEMA.  HVUD has experienced no releases in the five years of this reporting period.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nThe Harpeth Valley Utilities District began work on the first phase of a new water treatment plant expansion in early 2014.  As part of later phases of this expansi"

      "SummaryText": "on project, we plan to eliminate our existing gas chlorine disinfection system and replace it with an alternate technology, which will either be a bulk bleach feed operation or an on-site generation system.  This improvement will make our treatment process much safer and will eliminate the need for a Risk Management Program when it is implemented.  The target date for this change in our disinfection system is sometime in 2017.  Until that time the Harpeth Valley Utilities District will continue to operate using gas chlorine as the primary disinfectant, and the EPA Risk Management plan and OSHA Process Safety Management rule will continue to be implemented. \n\n"
