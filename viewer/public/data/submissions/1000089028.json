      "SummaryText": "Sargento Foods, Inc., in Plymouth, Wisconsin is home to Sargento headquarters and houses the main distribution center. Production lines at the plant process a variety of dairy products. Processes conducted at the Plymouth facility include high speed slicing with zip closure packaging, horizontal form/fill/seal shred packaging with zip closures, dices and cubed cheese in bulk packaging, and high-speed portion- control packaging of grated dry cheese. This plant is situated on a 65-acre parcel of land near the northwestern limits of the City of Plymouth. Adjacent properties to the south are industrial and commercial, to the west are residential and to the north and east are rural residential.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a basic single-stage mechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. There are two separate ammonia systems at the facility, with the compressors in two separate mechanical rooms. The original system (referred to as the \"West\" Ammonia Refrigeration System) was constructed in 1993 to 1994, and the new system (referred to as the \"East\" Ammonia Refrigeration System) was constructed in 2005. The systems are completely independent of each other. The total maximum intended inventory of ammonia in the West System is approximately 13,625 pounds, and the total maximum intended inventory of ammonia in the East System is approximately 16,579 pounds. Both ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and installed in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code Department of Safety and Professional Services Chapter 345, ASTM standards, and ASHRAE 15. The facility is equipped with alarm and ammonia detection systems, which continually monitor the refrigeration system. Also, Sargento ammonia technicians conduct daily inspections of the ammonia system.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at Sargento Foods - Plymouth is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) which requires the facility to manage system op"

      "SummaryText": "erations and develop emergency response and accident prevention programs. Sargento Foods developed and implemented a PSM program for the Plymouth facility in 2005. The facility is also required to comply with EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP). The RMP rule, found in 40CFR68, uses a tiered approach for its risk management requirements. The Sargento - Plymouth facility requires a Program 3 RMP Plan, because it is also regulated under the PSM program.\n\n\n\nThe program requirements under the RMP and PSM programs are similar, and include safety information, hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits and contractor management. Both programs require a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The most recent PHA was conducted in May 2017. In addition, the RMP program includes an offsite consequence analysis, a management system, and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario involves the release of the total volume of liquid ammonia that can be stored in the largest pressure vessel in the ammonia refrigeration room. The release is assumed to be an unmitigated release that occurs over a period of 10 minutes. For the West System, this would involve the release of 9,721 pounds of liquid ammonia from the control pressure receiver. For the East System, this would involve the release of 7,735 pounds of liquid ammonia from the high temperature re-circulator. For this scenario to occur, several pressurized vessels, the alarm system, the safety relief valves, and the engineering controls would all have to fail. The building would serve as passive mitigation. In the unlikely event of a release of this nature, the distance to the toxic end point could be up to 0.9 miles. This is based on the EPA's RMP*Comp&trade; model.\n\n\n\nSeveral additional release scenarios were evaluated for the Sargento Plymouth ammonia systems. These alternat"

      "SummaryText": "e scenarios represent conditions which are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. The scenario resulting in the greatest offsite impact is the material failure of a 4\" diameter pipe located on the roof, resulting in a ?-inch diameter hole, causing ammonia to release under pressure. The release could have a toxic endpoint distance of up to 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\nSargento Foods is committed to protecting the health and well-being of their employees, the community, and the environment. Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia awareness training and emergency action procedures for all employees, annual training for the spill response teams, annual response training for the maintenance personnel and ammonia system training for the ammonia technicians. Training schedules are handled promptly by the Plant (Sr.) Safety Professional. The facility has a chemical labeling program and a spill prevention plan. Outside contractors must follow written contractor policies. Hot work permits and lockout/tagout procedures are required.\n\n\n\nSargento Foods has never had an accident involving the ammonia system that caused deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. If an emergency were to occur, the local fire and hazardous response team would be notified, and the emergency response procedures would be followed. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan, and emergency drills are carried out several times each year. Each shift has a trained emergency action team whose purpose is coordination with outside response personnel. The Sheboygan County Local Emergency Planning Committee has an offsite plan for the ammonia system. The local response teams are invited to visit the Sargento Plymouth Facility each year.\n\n\n\n"
