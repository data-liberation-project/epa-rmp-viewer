This commitment\n\nis demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and\n\nconsidering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to\n\nimplement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated\n\nsubstances. However, if a release does occur, trained facility personnel will evaluate the situation, take\n\nactions within the capabilities of the facility to control and contain the release, and notify the necessary\n\noutside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nTarga Pipeline Mid-Continent Holdings, LLC owns and operates the Benedum Gas Plant, which is a nonfractionating\n\nnatural gas plant located approximately 12 miles northeast of Rankin in Upton County,\n\nTexas. The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by\n\nphysical separation and cryogenic means. Petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered\n\nfrom the inlet pipeline at this location for offsite sales.\n\nThe Benedum Gas Plant operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration compression to assist in\n\nextracting liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas. Plant products include pipeline quality natural\n\ngas-primarily methane-and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane,\n\nand heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances. The part of the process\n\nthat was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Benedum Gas Plant which\n\ncould contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\n- Condensate Storage Tank V-31 comprised primarily of a Butane-plus (NGL)"

It is\n\nnoteworthy that the Benedum Gas Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety\n\nManagement (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance in this\n\nGas Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank\n\ncontaining the condensate NGL mixture. For Worst Case Scenario calculations it is assumed that the full\n\ninventory capacity (100% maximum tank capacity of 35,000 gallons) of this tank is to release and ignite,\n\nresulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1 psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.46 miles or\n\napproximately 2,445 feet. Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases\n\nand to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into\n\naccount in evaluating or calculating the WCS for the Benedum Gas Plant.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Benedum Gas Plant is a VCE\n\nresulting from a release of 36,356 pounds of the condensate NGL mixture over a sixty (60) minute period,\n\nresulting from a seal failure at the condensate pump, CPS-101. This hypothetical release is expected to\n\nbe isolated by an operator in less than sixty minutes. The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure\n\nendpoint for this event is 0.27 miles or 1,400 feet. This event was selected as being the most statistically\n\ncredible scenario for use in emergency planning and response. Although the Benedum Gas Plant is\n\nclassi"

The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM\n\nelements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe Benedum Gas Plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and\n\naccident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical\n\ndocuments and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA)\n\nteam. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention\n\nprogram. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented\n\nin an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident\n\nprevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that\n\naddress process and employee safety issues.

This information is supplemented by\n\ndocuments that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with\n\nthe inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safetyrelated\n\nlimits for specific process parameters in operating manuals. The gas plant ensures that the\n\nprocess is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly\n\ntrained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Benedum Gas Plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the\n\ndesign and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction,\n\ndesign pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in\n\ncombination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection\n\nand maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that\n\nsafety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe Benedum Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the\n\nvarious processes are identified and controlled.
