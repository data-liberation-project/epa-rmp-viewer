      "SummaryText": "The Bodega Bay Public Utility District (District) operates a wastewater treatment plant (Plant) in Bodega Bay, Sonoma County, California.  The District has implemented a federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) program as required under regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Based on the regulatory requirements and on Facility operations, a Program Level 3 Prevention Program has been prepared for Plant operations.\nChlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process as a disinfectant.  Chlorine is stored in sufficient quantity to be regulated under RMP regulations.\nThis RMP includes a review of the potential hazards associated with chlorine, operational procedures, maintenance procedures, and employee training.  The District has prepared an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that coordinates the actions of staff with local emergency responders.  This information has been provided to the Local Emergency Planning Committee and to local emergency response agencies.\nAs required under the RMP, AMEC Geomatrix, Inc. (AMEC), and the District have evaluated a worst-case release scenario using parameters described in 40 CFR Part 68.25.  The worst-case scenario is the rupture and release of the entire contents of a one-ton chlorine cylinder.  An alternative release scenario was evaluated using parameters described in 19 CCR 2750.4 and 40 CFR Part 68.28, based on off-site consequence guidance published by the EPA in 1999.  The alternative release scenario is a leak during cylinder change-out.  The Toxic Endpoint concentra\u00action (TE) for chlorine from the RMP regulations was used for this evaluation.\nThis RMP is based on information provided by the District; information obtained by AMEC during an April 6, 2009, visit to the Plant; and published references.  For purposes of this report, AMEC has assumed that information provided is accurate, representative, and suitable as the basis for preparing a RMP."
