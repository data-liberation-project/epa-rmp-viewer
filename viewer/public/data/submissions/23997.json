      "SummaryText": "1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the Arch Chemicals Brandenburg facility, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protect the environment.  As a company, we are committed to excellence in health, safety, and the environment.  Arch Chemicals operates under the philosophy that all accidents are preventable ...all of the time.  We recently revitalized this commitment with an ambitious new initiative - \"The Goal is Zero\".  This initiative is all about striving to achieve zero recordable injuries, zero environmental incidents, zero manufacturing process incidents, and zero distribution incidents.  The same dedication to excellence marks our Product Stewardship initiative, under which we address health, safety, and the environment throughout each products' life cycle.  \n\nThe following sections provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities in practice at the Brandenburg facility.  Also attached are the data elements from our risk management program that are required by EPA's RMP rule.\n\n2.0  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Arch Chemicals Brandenburg facility is a 220-acre site located east of Brandenburg, Kentucky.  The facility is divided into eleven (10) distinct units:  Ethylene Oxide, Polysolvs?, Light Hydro Carbons (LHC), Polychemicals, Polymer Polyol, TDI Terminal, Microelectronics, Pilot Plant, Utilities, and Waste Water Treatment.  Primary products of the facility include ethylene oxide, ethylene, propylene glycols, polyether polyols, glycol ethers, and microelectronic chemicals.  Note at this time (July, 2001) that the ethylene oxide and light hydrocarbon facilities are shut down.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following toxic chemicals that EPA has iden"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios and our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposu"

      "SummaryText": "re distances for each scenario:\n\nToxics:  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nEthylene Oxide:  The selected worst case release scenario assumes the failure of a storage tank containing 127,000 pounds of ethylene oxide.  The required assumption is that the entire contents of the tank are released in 10 minutes.  Upon release the liquid forms a pool which evaporates at a rate of 406 lb/min.  Using the EPA OCA tables, urban topography and stipulated meteorology (wind speed of 1.5 m/sec and F stability class), and passive mitigation measures, the ethylene oxide could travel up to 8.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  A release of this magnitude could potentially impact area residences and both the Meade County and Harrison County schools.  There are no EPA listed receptors within the impact distance.  Although unrealistic, this scenario meets the requirements of a release of the largest quantity from a vessel that has the potential for the farthest off-site impact.  Although passive mitigation in the form of dikes were considered for this release scenario, the facility also has sprinkler and deluge systems that would be utilized in a release of this type but were not considered in the consequence analysis.  \n\nToxics:  Alternate Release Scenario\n\nIn accordance with the EPA RMP rule, a more credible \"alternate\" release scenario was considered for each toxic chemical.  This scenario is often called the planning scenario because we use the information to develop our detailed emergency response plan.  While a number of scenarios are considered for each of the chemicals covered by the RMP, only one for each toxic chemical is presented.  All scenarios were evaluated using the EPA OCA tables and the stipulated alternate weather conditions of 3.0 m/sec windspeed and D stability class.\n\nFormaldehyde:  The more credible alternate release scenario for formaldehyde considers a leak in a 1.5-inch line.

The formaldehyde could travel 0.31 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.\n\nEthylenediamine:  An evaluation of credible releases of ethylenediamine (EDA) from the facility produced no scenarios that could potentially result in an off-site impact.  The most credible alternate release scenario for EDA considers a transfer hose rupture.  Because of shutoff valves at the tank truck and the reactor, only 12 pounds of EDA (the contents of the hose) would be spilled.  The resulting plume would travel less than 0.06 miles from the area and would remain onsite.\n\nEthylene Oxide:  The more credible alternate release scenario for ethylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the polychemical area.  Approximately 370 pounds is released to the air in five  30-second lifts.  The resulting plume could travel approximately .75 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include area residences and the Ohio River.\n\nPropylene Oxide:  The more credible alternate release scenario for propylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the polychemical area.  Approximately 2,270 pounds is released to the air at a height of almost 50 feet in five 30-second lifts.

Approximately 100 pounds would be released from the vapor space of the railcar.  The resulting plume could travel approximately 0.31 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include Doe Run Creek.\n\nAmmonia:  The more credible alternate release scenario for ammonia considers the failure of an ammonia process line due to external erosion.  Liquid ammonia is spilled to the gravel surface and 116 pounds is released to the air.  The release lasts for approximately 20 minutes and travels approximately 0.31 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.\n\nHydrochloric Acid (37%):  An evaluation of credible releases of 37% HCl from the facility produced no scenarios that could potentially result in an off-site impact.

Administratively limit the maximum allowable inventory for toxic chemicals handled at the facility, including ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, hydrochloric acid, and acrylonitrile.\n\n2.  Conduct extensive in-process and effluent wastewater monitoring in excess of NPDES permit requirements for derivatives of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.\n\n3.

An Emergency Response Plan has been developed for the Brandenburg facility in order to provide an effective and efficient response to any type of incident.  The Emergency Response Plan addresses all federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency planning.  To assist us in the event of an emergency, local area emergency responders have been provided with our Emergency Response Plan.  Drills and training for the Arch-Brandenburg Emergency Response Team (ERT) are conducted independently and in conjunction with the Brandenburg Fire Department.  Emergency Response Team members are onsite 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  The Meade County Fire Department is responsible for notifying the public of any release which has potential off-site impacts.\n\n7.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Brandenburg facility has planned facility improvements that will help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.  A USEPA Chemical Safety Audit was conducted at the Arch Chemicals-Brandenburg facility in March, 1999.  A variety of recommendations are being implemented as a result of our participation in this program, including:\n\n1.  Increased operator training for emergency response activities.\n2.
