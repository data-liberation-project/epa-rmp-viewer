This area is used only for the storage and use of our chlorine as well as other chemicals that may be used in the treatment process.\n\nThe process of getting chlorine out of the storage cylinder and into the treatment process is a simple procedure for our employees.  Once a container is empty, our specially trained staff then shut of the supply, disconnect the regulator from the empty cylinder, and reconnect it to a new cylinder of chlorine.  They check to make sure the cylinder has no leaks and turn the system back on.  If a leak occurs, the most common way t fix it is to shut off the supply.  Our trained staff know  how to perform this shut-off procedure and others like it  in the event that they must use  them.  They maintain specialized equipment they might need to use in the near-by area.\n\nOnce the chlorine supply is turned back on, the chlorine is sent to the plant through specially manufactured and purchased equipment that automatically ensures that the right amount is provided to our wastewater and ultimately to the river.  This equipment is inspected by our trained staff on a regular basis.  More complicated repairs are provided by the manufacturer or specialized contractors.\n\nAs part of our responsibilities in this process, we have carefully examined out method of handling the chlorine and other chemicals, including reviewing and revising what we can, or must do in and emergency.   To assist us in the process we enlisted the aid of a consulting firm to provide a source of specialized knowledge and to help us take and honest look at ourselves.
