These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\r\nThe only RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling and freezing medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest"

The refrigeration system in this facility does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard. Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\r\n\r\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\n\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We have a preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond to system upsets.\r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.\r\n\r\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.\r\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements: \r\nEmployee Participation Program\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis \r\nOperating Procedures \r\nTraining Program \r\nContractor Safety Program\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures \r\nMechanical Integrity Program\r\nHot Work Permit Procedures \r\nManagement of Change Procedures \r\nIncident Investigation Procedures \r\nCompliance Audit Procedures\r\n\r\nD.
