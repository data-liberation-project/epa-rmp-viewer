Our efforts range from designing safety into our manufacturing operations to regular assessments identifying opportunities for safety improvements. An important new elements in Tonawanda 3M's continuous improvement program is to install additional innovative pollution-control equipment to reduce air emissions by 50 to 70 percent.\nIn addition, Tonawanda 3M has implemented an updated corporate policy to make safety a part of every employee's responsibility.  This policy encourages employees to identify any situations they perceive to be unsafe, as well as any opportunities to improve safety. This policy has also been incorporated into the Tonawanda 3M Safety Mission Statement."

Introduction\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan of Tonawanda 3M .  We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  Since 1990, 3M has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 80 percent, and releases to water 75 percent. \n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Town of Tonawanda Fire Department and/or Brighton Hazmat  emergency response organization arrives. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \n \n3.  The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe manufacture cellulose sponges at a facility located on a 19 acre site within an industrial zoned area of Tonawanda, New York. The approximately 275,000 square foot plant includes manufacturing, converting and warehouse facilities and employs approximately 325 people. We use one regulated substances at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experi"

Viscose is  used  in the production of cellulose sponges.\n\n4.  Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nEPA has directed all affected facilities to share with their communities a look at the worst possible accident that could happen at the facility, as unlikely as that might be, and an alternative, more realistic, accident scenario.   \n\nTo evaluate our worst case release scenarios, Tonawanda 3M used RMP*Comp, an air modeling program  provided by the EPA. Our worst case scenario is the release of the entire contents of the carbon disulfide storage tank over a 23.7 minute time frame. Our analysis does not take into account the use of a water filled dike which would limit the impact of a release under the worst case scenario. Carbon disulfide is heavier than water and would be completely coverd by the water during a release into the dike.\n\nTo evaluate our alternative release scenarios, Tonawanda 3M used RMP*Comp, an air modeling program  provided by the EPA. The alternative release scenario for carbon disulfide is a release of the chemical in  liquid form over  25 seconds. Our analysis includes operating procedures, alarms, and a redundant control system which will shut down the operation within 25 seconds following the detection of a leak. The analysis also takes into account the use of a dike to assist in limiting the potential of a release with off site consequences. \n\n5. Tonawanda 3M Program to Prevent Accidental Releases \n\nAt  Tonawanda 3M, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nWe have programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, Process Safety Management requirements f"
