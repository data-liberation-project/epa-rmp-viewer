The PHA team for Hydrogen is comprised of Gas Engineer (team leader), Safety representative for gases, Gas Technician, manufacturing representatives from site manufacturing organizations, Emergency Control representative, and engineer from Air Products (Vendor). \n\nOperating procedures for Hydrogen were written by the Gas Engineer using technical process descriptions and process safety information, and with input from the involved employees.  Operating procedures, as specified in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Documentation for the Hydrogen System, are available from Site Systems Engineering (D/20G) and Utility Plant and Bulk Gas operations (D/88B).  The operating procedure are documented as Bulk Gas Procedures or as Desk References, and are available in B/316. \n\nTraining for Hydrogen is formulated and tracked by the Gas Engineer and training records are maintained by D/20G and D/88B managers.  \nIncident investigation program follows the IBM incident report procedure in the Safety & Health Manual Index 04-01-04A for fact determination, root cause analysis and recommendation implementation.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity for Hydrogen is shared between the gas supplier and IBM.  The program consists of equipment lists and specifications, equipment history, and preventative maintenance procedures. \n\nHot work permits for work on the  hydrogen system are issued by IBM (Emergency Control) or Air Products.  This permit issuing process includes a safety inspection of  the area.  \n\nQuality assurance of the Management of Change (MOC) program for Hydrogen  is provided  by the Hydrogen  Storage Process Safety Management Owner.  The MOC is composed of a written program with elements delegated to appropriate members of the PSM team.  A copy of the documentation is maintained for the life of the process. \n\nQuality assurance of the hydrogen pre-startup review program is provided by the Hydrogen Storage  Process Safety Management Owner.   Documentation is maintained as part"
