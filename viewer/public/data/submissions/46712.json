Ammonia at greater than 20% is stored at the Ammonia Treatment Plant and is covered by Prevention Program 2 .  Hydrogen is currently stored in a single location within the facility and  covered by Prevention Program 3. \n \nPrevention Program 2  Ammonia Treatment \n\nThe PHA Team for Ammonia Treatment is comprised of Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer (team leader), Safety representative, Treatment Plant operator, Controls Technician, and Design Firm representatives.  The results of each PHA are recorded and maintained on file.\n\nOperating procedures for the Ammonia Treatment Plant were originally written by the manufacturer and design firms, with input from Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer and involved employees using technical process descriptions and process safety information.  Operating procedures, as specified in the Ammonia Treatment Plant Operations O+ M Manual are available from Environmental  Engineering and Operations, (D/92D).\n\nTraining for the Ammonia Treatment Plant Operation is formulated and tracked by the  Ammonia Treatment Plant  Engineer and training records are maintained by D/92D manager.\n\nIncident investigation program follows the IBM incident report procedure in the Safety & Health Manual Index 04-01-04A for fact determination, root cause analysis and recommendation implementation.\n\nPrevention Program 3  Hydrogen Storage\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for Hydrogen Storage is conducted on a five year schedule by the Process Hazard Ana"
