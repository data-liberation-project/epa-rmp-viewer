Our goals are to promote and \n  strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Site 1 implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Site 1 uses 1,3 Butadiene and Anhydrous Ammonia. Ammonia is used for cooling purposes only. 1,3 Butadiene is used to manufacture a water based emulsion polymer or dispersion. This dispersion is used in a variety of products including foams for pillows and mattresses, shoe inserts, general purpose adhesives and for asphalt modification to improve resiliency and extend the service life of streets and highways. \n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\n7 The toxic gas release of anhydrous ammonia with off-site impacts. \n7 Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 1,3 butadiene with off-site impacts. Administrative \n   procedures limit the 1,3 butadiene storage capacity.   \n\nAlternative\n\n7 The pipe leak of anhydrous ammonia with off-site impacts. \n7 Jet fire resulting from the release of 1,3 butadiene with off-site impacts.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release(s) over the past five years, which meet the reporting criteria.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  Hazmat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard "
