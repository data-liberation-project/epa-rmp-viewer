The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban and largely populated with Solar Turbines, Inc. test facilities and offices.  \n\n\n\nSolar Turbines, Inc. (Solar) has a Closed Loop Test Facility (CLTF) to develop and test gas compressors. The CLTF operates with nitrogen, carbon dioxide or odorized natural gas (methane) to test solar gas compressors. The regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this study is methane. The CLTF system is interconnected with the underground methane supply pipeline from SDG&E distribution system to the on-site storage, the 30,000-gallon Storage Tank, the pipeline delivery system, the Plant Fuel Consumption, and the Thermal Oxidizer.  The Fuel Consumption process is exempt from the EPA RMP and CalARP Program regulation per regulations established on January 23, 2000.  Thus, \"covered "

The CLTF is interconnected to the main pipeline supply from the 30,000-gallon Storage Tank and the Fuel Consumption process.  Once the CLTF is complete and operational, the procedure will be to open a manual valve off the main 650 psig feed line to the CLTF to pressurize the CLTF.  \n\n\n\nThe CLTF consists of an existing SOLAR gas turbine driving a SOLAR gas compressor and all necessary equipment to conduct a closed loop test. The CLTF will operate with nitrogen, carbon dioxide or odorized natural gas (methane) to test solar gas compressors. The CLTF loop estimated volume is 2,300 cubic feet. The weight of natural gas in the process is not expected to exceed 13,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nOnce the CLTF is pressurized, the manual valve will be closed.  Once testing is complete, the methane is destroyed at the Plant Thermal Oxidizer.  \n\n\n\nThe CLTF has been designed using recognized standards and codes. It is designed to ensure that all personnel are in a safe environment at all times.
