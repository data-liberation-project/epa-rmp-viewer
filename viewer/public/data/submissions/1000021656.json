Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe W R Grace-CONN Curtis Bay, Maryland Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design,\ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. It is company and site  policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, the site has HazWoper trained individuals on site to control and mitigate the effects of incipient releases.  They do not have the ability to respond to emergencies requiring Class A or B PPE. The site is also part of SBIMAP and coordinates with the Baltimore City FD Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility's primary activities encompass (insert description). The site  have only one  substance, titanium tetrachloride present at our facility, that is regulated under RMP. The maximum inventory of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) present at our facility is  10800 pounds in containers of nominal maximum 1400 pounds net weight, DOT rated portable cylinders of  28 and 118 gallons. Waste will be stored in a DOT rated cylinder holding 1980 gallons or tanker truck.\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and \nmitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. -  Omitted as recommended by USEPA\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR \npart 68 of the EPA.
