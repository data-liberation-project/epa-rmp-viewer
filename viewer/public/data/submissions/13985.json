Training, maintenance, and written policy have proven to be an effective prevention program. The chlorination process is checked no less than six times a day and documented in log book. Employees are consciencous and care about the safety of fellow employees and local residents.\n\nThe City Corporation Water Treatment Plant provides an average of six millions gallons of treated drinking water to the city of Russellville and surrounding communities every day. The regulated chemical, liquid chlorine, is used as an oxydizer to destroy contaminants and pathogens in finished drinking water. A dual one ton cylinder feed system and two spare one ton tanks of liquid chlorine mean there may be as much as four tons on hand at the water plant at any given time.\n\nThe EPA RMP*Comp model shows that if a one ton liquid chlorine cylinder ruptured and all the liquid was released into the atmosphere as a gas, the worst-case estimated distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.9 miles from the plant. An alternate release scenario, such as a ruptured disk or pipe leak, predicts the distance to the toxic endpoint to be 0.2 miles. Both scenarios would possibly affect many residences in close proximity to the plant, but such catostrophic failures of equipment, particularly when well managed and maintained, is a rarity.\n\nCity Corporation believes that a strong prevention program and a rehearsed emergency response will provide adequate protection to employees and residents from and accidental release.\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant has not experienced an accidental release of liquid chlorine in the last five years.\n\nThe emergency response program is a written guide of step-by-step instructions in the event of an accidental release. Immediate notification of the Russellville Fire Department, LEPC, local residents, and the emergency response team occurs. The team is a group of experienced, trained operators who kno"
