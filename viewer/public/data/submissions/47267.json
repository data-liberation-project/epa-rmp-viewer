Louis Dreyfus has installed a cryognic gas processing plant at the Chalmette Refinery, an eighty mile long 10\" pipeline from Chalmette to Geismar, LA and a fractionation plant in Geismar.  Present personnel complement is 26 for the operations and maintenance activities. \n\nThe Geismar Fractionation Facility separates pipeline liquid natural gases to produce the following pure components:\n\n1.  Ethane\n2.  Ethylene\n3.  Propane\n4.  Propylene\n5.  N-butane\n6.  Isobutane\n7.  Natural gasoline\n\nMost of the liquids are shipped to customers via pipeline.  Some products are shipped by tank trucks.  There is limited on-site storage of products in pressurized tanks.  All products are gases at atmospheric pressure and temperature.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\n\nLouis Dreyfus has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accidental releases of flammable materials to the environment.  The policy is supported by many programs such as compliance with OSHAs 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification, and retraining program with written operating procedures.  Since the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, it qualifies as a Program 3 facility under EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safet"
