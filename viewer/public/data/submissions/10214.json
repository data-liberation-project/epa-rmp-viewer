Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at the Glencoe Butter and Produce Association in Glencoe are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Glencoe Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support for agricultural and residential services.  We have propane  stored in an 18,000-gallon tank located at our agronomy site in Glencoe (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 15,300 gallons (64,611.9 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n3.    Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the  propane storage tank (64,611.9 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.32 mile (Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of houses and can result in serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated population"

      "SummaryText": " within a 0.32-mile radius of this facility is 200 .\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that contacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is less than 0.06 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.06-mile radius of this facility is 10.\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nGlencoe Butter and Produce maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nGlencoe Butter and Produce maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nGlencoe Butter and Produce has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nGlencoe Butter and Produce conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are performed by qualified personnel with previous training in maint"

Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Glencoe Butter and Produce to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nGlencoe Butter and Produce routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nGlencoe Butter and Produce conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions of the plan, as set out under 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nGlencoe Butter and Produce truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nGlencoe Butter and Produce has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no acciden"
