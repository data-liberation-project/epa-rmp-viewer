The program covers anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system, anhydrous ammonia used in the wastewater system, and chlorine ustilized as a disinfecting agent.  These regulated hazardous substances are present in the facility above the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) threshold quantities of 500 lbs (anhydrous ammonia) and 100 lbs. (chlorine).\n\nThe facility is a food processing plant that consists of single-story and two story buildings, cold storage rooms, blast freezing tunnels, and processing areas within two plants.  The entire Atwater facility covers approximately 58 acres.  Facility staff are on-site 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year.\n\nThe J.R. Wood RMP document has been prepared in accordance with CalARP Final Regulations and with local requirements prescribed by Merced County.  Volume I of the RMP document contains information available for public review.  Confidential information is contained in Volume II.  Volume I includes the facility's 5-year accident history, the accidental release prevention program, the emergency response program and the program certification.\n\nBased on the quantities of ammonia and chlorine, the Atwater facility is required to complete a Program 3 Accidental Release Prevention Program.  Program elements and prevention steps include but are not limited to: design codes and standards, process safety information, process hazard review, operating procedures, training procedures, maintenance equipment inspection and testing procedures and competency testing, management of change, pre-start up review, contractor safety information, and external events analysis.\n\nThe Atwater facility has developed measures to mitigate the effects and limit the distances for the reported scenarios.  The risk reductions include:  Contiuously review and revise written operating procedures and "

No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the Atwater facility in the last five years.\n\nOn June 9, 2004, there was an ammonia release of approximently 326 lbs.  An evacuation of plant employees in nearby work areas was initiated.  There were no employee injures or off-site consequences.    \n\nThe Atwater facility has a written Emergency Response/Action Plan that includes specific actions to be taken by facility employees in response to accidental releases of ammonia and chlorine, and these procedures are covered in employee training.  The Atwater facility has a Hazmat Spill Response Team.  Periodically, the JR Wood Hazmat team holds drills simulating a mock release with the Merced County Hazardous Materials Response Team.  Training for the Hazardous Material Response Team is held on an annual basis.  The Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for coordinating with local agencies responding to accidental releases and informing the public."
