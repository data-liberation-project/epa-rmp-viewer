      "SummaryText": "Facility Background\n\nAt the San Pedro facility we handle butane and propane, both which are recognized by the EPA as regulated, flammable substances.  The same properties that make butane and propane valuable as fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in their handling to prevent leaks, spills and accidents.  First and formost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the the surrounding communities.  It is Rancho LPG Holdings policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute butane and propane to wholesale customers.  Butane is received and/or distributed via pipieline, rail and transports.  Butane is stored in two refrigerated storage tanks each bulk tank having a nonimal capacity of 13 million.  In addition butane is also stored in two 60,000 gal horizontal vessels.  Propane is received and/or distributed via rail or transport trucks.  The propane is stored in three 60,000 gal hortizontal vessels.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.\n\nThe maxium amount of butane that can be stored on site is 120 million pounds.  For propane, the maxium inventory that can be stored on site is 640,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Practices\n\nThe site and the company continually strive to improve operations performance including the prevention of incidents, injuries and releases at the facility.  Primary elements of this continuous improvements effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaing up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.  The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through periodic in"

      "SummaryText": "spection and preventive maintenance. The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via extensive inspection and painting program.\n\nThe site is also equipped with modern leak detection systems comprised of ultraviolet and infrared fire detection sensors that alert personnel should a leak and fire occur.  These sensors are located at strategic points throughout the facility and work in conjunction with shutdown systems and emergency response equipment also installed onsite. Shutdown systems include automatic postive shutoff valves and other critical interlocks designed to shutdown affected equipment or isolate a problem once detected.\n\nShould an actual leak occur emergency response equipment such as the sites extensive sprinklers systems would activate to help minimize the hazards assiocated with the leak.  In addition, a continuously operating flare is in service on site to minimize gas emissions to the atmosphere during normal and upset opertions.\n\nThe facility is subject to and abids by OSHA'a Process Safety Management rule for site handling hazards chemicals.  In addition the site complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other appicable federal, state and local codes and regulations, including Californias requirments for seismic activity study and design.  When built this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA 58.\n\nFive Year Accidental History\n\nthis facility has not had an accident or release meeting RMP criteria within the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility is considered a non-responding location with no toxic substances on site and as such is not required to maintain an Emergency Response Plan.  An a non-responding facility the site maintains an Emergency Action Plan which includes procedures for the notification of local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations.

      "SummaryText": " affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel.  Should an actual incident occur the EAP gives guidance to employees on when and how to respond to minor incidents, spills and small fires.  Larger emergencies require the assistance of local emergency response agencies, including the Los Angeles fire department and onsite personnel are knowledgeableas to when that outside assistance is required.\n\nThe EAP is reviewed anunally to ensure that it remains up to date, reflecting current activities on site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situatiion arise."
