We are within range of the local fire department and approximately 10 miles of a local hospital facility.  If an emergency situation would ever occur, we could obtain medical and safety professionalism very quickly.  We have a plan for evacuation if it would ever be necessary.  However it is very unlikely that such an occurence would ever happen.  We practice sound and safety procedures that maintain are safety records at there present levels.  All equipment is checked routinely and all employees have been properly instructed on handling of hazardous chemicals and fertilizers.  We take safety as a very serious matter and regularly hold safety training for all the employees and managers. We properly store all hazardous pesticides and fertilizers for the protection of humans and the environment.  All regulated sustances are treated with the upmost respect and knowledge of knowing what to do if a worst case release would occur.  Once again I will relate the fact that this is very unlikely to happen.  We have not had a release of any toxic material  in the twenty years that we have been in operation in New Haven, Mo.  We will operate the Marthasville, Mo  location in the same manner regarding safety as a main priority.    In a worst case scenario, there would be no offsite impact.  All pesticides are stored in secondary containments which prevents the contaimination of any land or connecting tributaries.  In the worst case scenario of a spill of Anhydrous Ammonia, there are automatic shutoff valves that prevent the release on any hazardous amount of Ammonia.  Our facility complies with all regulations pertaining to the hand"

We have coordinated with the local fire departments, and LEPC personnel to promote a working relationship to aid in their safety if they ever have to answer a call to any of our facilities.   We will be installing a security system to detect any unappropriate presence on the grounds of the Marthasville location.  We have installed good lighting for the safety of a security patrol.       We realize the potential hazard if chemicals and fertilizers are not handled properly.  However,Marthasville is a farming community that deserves to have the services required of us by providing agricultural pesticides and fertilizers, including Anhydrous Ammonia.  There are many farms which raise livestock and plant row crops.  Therefore, these above mentioned products are greatly needed in this area.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a safe products when handled safely.  Our intentions are do to so properly.    We invite the public to tour our facility at their convenience.  If anyone should have any questions concerning our methods of operation, we would gladly do our best to explain what we do and why we do it.  Respectfully submitted by Robert and Kelly Toelke."
