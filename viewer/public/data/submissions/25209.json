The plan has been prepared in accordance with section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Standard (40 CFR Part 68), RMP.  The intent of this legislation is to protect the public health and safety and the environment from the accidental release of acutely hazardous materials (AHMs).  The preparation and implementation of this RMP by the AMVAC Chemical Corporation, Axis Plant, a handler of acutely hazardous materials, meets the intent of the RMP regulation and the relevent portions of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management regulations.\n\nThe AMVAC Axis facility was originally a portion of the DuPont Mobile Manufacturing Center.  It was purchased from DuPont by AMVAC on 5-18-2001.  The necessary documentation for the facility  to comply with the RMP legislation was a part of that purchase agreement.  All of the Hazard and Operability Studies and Process Hazard Analysies were originially documented by DuPont and they have all  been reviewed by AMVAC in preparation of this RMP.  The AMVAC Axis plant and the DuPont MMC are on a common site.  All site Emergency Response is mutually shared and coordinated by the emergency teams from both companies.  \n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMission Statement:  AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) is committed to the following:\n1.  Providing its customers with environmentally friendly, cost-effective and high-quality products on time.\n2.  Providing a safe and secure working environment for its employees.\n3.  Operating in a manner which meets or exceeds existing laws and regulations and reflects a high level of concern and respect for the local community.\n4.

To achieve this we follow a four-point plan based on Training, Auditing, Reporting and Enforcement.\n\n2.0  Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation manufactures agricultural pesticides at its plant located at 12650 Hwy. 43 N. In Axis, Alabama.  The facility receives steam, fire water, process water, potable water and air from the DuPont facility located on the common site.  The facility consists of various buildings, chemical reactors, above ground storage tanks, truck loading/unloading stations, railcar unloading stations, peripheral tanks, and various ancillary equipment.\nThe AMVAC Axis plant has a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 32532 for Pesticide and Agricultural Chemical Manufacuring.  The plant manufactures pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHMs) in quantities which make them subject to the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMPR) requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68).\n\n* Listed Toxic Substances:\n1.  Chlorine, CAS 7782-50-5 used in Fortress Synthesis\n2.  Phosphorous Trichloride, CAS 7719-12-2 used in Fortress Synthesis\n3. Hydrogen Sulfide, CAS 7783-06-4 used in Fortress Synthesis\n4. Hydrogen Chloride (anhydrous), CAS 7446-09-5 off-gas produced in Assana\n5. Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), CAS 7647-01-0 off-gas produced in Assana \n6. Formaldehyde 37% solution, CAS 50-00-0 used"

The hydrogen sulfide associated with this process is normally generated on-site and the one ton cylinders are used as a backup if the generation should fail.\n\nAssana Process:\n\nThe AHS associated with this process are hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and 37% formaldehyde solution.  This is a batch process so the total available quantities of hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide within the process have been listed as the total quantity of each that is generated in a batch.  \n  \n3.0  The Wost-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s):\n\nSeveral release scenarios for each of the acutely hazardous materials of concern, Chlorine (CL2), Phosphorous Trichloride (PCL3) and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) were considered.  The release senarios for Hydrogen Chloride (anhydrous) (HCL) and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) (SO2) were based upon the evolution of these gasses from the process reaction. These gasses are incinerated and not stored.   For the purpose of conducting Offsite Consequence Analysis, absolute worst case and alternative release scenarios were selected.  Worst case scenarios are mandated by the RMP rule.  For the regulated chemicals used at AMVAC these assumed a total failure of all systems in place and a total release of the chemical inventory.  The criteria used to choose an alternative release scenario is an attempt to more closely define a seious release episode that could conceivably occur, but is still substantially more severe than expected with the safety and monitoring equipment in use.  These scenarios include the following:\n\nWorst Case Scenario for covered Toxic Substances:\n\nBased on the evaluation and analysis of worst case scenarios for each of the covered toxic substances, hydrogen sulfide presented the largest distance to end po"

The worst case scenario for covered toxic substances at AMVAC Axis results from the complete rupture of a one ton cylinder of hydrogen sulfide containing 1075 pounds into an unmitigated release.  The event would have off-site consequences.  An event of this nature is very unlikely due to the testing of the cylinders that is done by the supplier.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios for each covered Toxic Substance:\n\nPhosphorus Trichloride:\nA leak develops in the pipe on the bottom disharge from the storage tank.  The solution leaks into the concrete containment dike for 20 minutes before the leak is isolated and the flow stopped.\n\nChlorine:\nA pipe flange leak develops in the piping to the reactor.  Chlorine vapor leaks out for 30 minutes before it is stopped. The leak would be discovered very early due to the monitors in the area, but the long time to complete the isolation has been excessively extended due to obtaining the breathing air that would be needed to enter the area.\n\nHydrogen Sulfide:\nA piping leak develops at the H2S generator.  The H2S gas leaks out for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  The leak would be discovered early due to the H2S monitors in the process area, but the isolation time has been greatly extended due to the breathing air requirement to enter the area.\n\nHydrogen Chloride (anhydrous):\nThe vent line from the reactor to the incinerator ruptures.  The HCL gas leaks out for 30 minutes as it is generated before the reaction is stopped and the vent line isolated.\n\nSulfur Dioxide (anhydrous):\nThe vent line from the reactor to the incinerator ruptures.  The SO2 gas leaks out for 30 minutes as it is generated befor the reaction is stopped and the vent line isolated.   \n\nFormaldehyde 37% solution:\nA piping leak develops at the discharge on the storage tank.  The Formaldehyde solution leaks into the tank farm diked area for 30 minutes until it is discovered and isolated at the tank discharge valve.\n\nThe offsite consequences for each of these scen"

Both AMVAC and DuPont have trained emergency response teams.  There is a written agreement between both parties that there will be mutual response for site wide emergencies.\n  \nThe AMVAC Axis facility is equipped with multiple levels of protection.  The potential for spills and releases is low.  In the event that a spill or release occurs, there are established written procedures for the handling of emergencies.\n\nThe procedures for handling emergencies include the Emergency Response Plan and the Operating Procedures Manuals for each area.  The Emergency Response Plan for the AMVAC facility (last revised 1-31-02) includes written procedures for handling releases and spills of hazardous materials in any area and contains specific emergency procedures for bomb threat, firefighting, emergency alarm activation,  evacuation, offsite emergencies, local area emergency notification, government agency notification and hurricanes.  The operating procedure manual for each process area contains emergency response information for the area.\n\nTo maintain and upgrade the emeregency response capabilities, AMVAC conducts inspections of the facility and the equipment, and emergency response drills are conducted simultaneously with the DuPont drills.  The Emergency Response Plan will be reviewed annually and/or when:\n\nA.  There is a major change in the facility chemicals and or plant operation that changes the potential for fires and the release of a hazardous substance, such that a change in the response is need for any emergency.\nB.  The plan fails in an emergency.\nC.  There is a change of emergency coordinators/responders.\nD.  There is a change"
