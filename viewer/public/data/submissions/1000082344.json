Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAmbassador Services, Inc.in Cape Canaveral, FL is committed to protecting its employees, the surrounding community and the environment from an accidental release of the anhydrous ammonia.   Ammonia is used in the refrigeration system.  The release prevention program addresses issues as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and training to ensure that releases do not occur.  Frequent inspections, regular maintenance, process monitors, rigorous supervised on-the-job training and 24 hour surveillance of the process reduce the likelihood and severity of an accidental release.  If a release does occur, however, employees are trained to contain the spill from a safe distance and implement notification procedures.  The emergency shutdown will be automatic with our monitoring/detection system.  There are manual emergency pull shut down alarms installed at the entrance to all engine rooms.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Cape Canaveral Fire and Rescue Services located within minutes of the facility. \n\n2.    The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is a cold and dry storage warehouse.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as cooling material in a closed system.  The maximum intended inventory is 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within the system.  It is the only regulated substance at the site that equals or exceeds the threshold quantity.  Due to the amount of product and the location of public receptors, the facility is covered as a Level 3 facility under EPA's regulation 40 CFR-69, the Risk Management Program (RMP).  The facility is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nThis facility has developed all prevention program elements based on both the Federal EPA's Accident Release (RMP) requirements set forth in 40"

The refrigeration system is built and operated in accordance with codes and standards.  The system has consistently performed without a major releases establishing a history of safe operation.  Drawings and written information specific to the process are maintained on site.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analyses - \n\nA PHA was conducted, deficiencies identified and corrections scheduled and/or implemented.  All PHAs are reviewed before re-submission and were reviewed and updated this year (August 1, 2019) \n\nOperating Procedures - \n\nSOPs, SMPs, PMPs were developed and implemented for all activities relating to the process and prepared in accordance with OSHA and EPA guidelines.  They are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to remain consistent with the process.  \n\nTraining - \n\nEmployees initially undergo an extensive 6-month apprenticeship with specific training, both classroom and on the job, in all phases of the process.  Refresher training is provided every 3 years or more frequently if necessary.  All process employees are trained to HazWoper Technician Level emergency response on an annual basis. \n\nMechanical Integrity - \n\nAn extensive maintenance program for all components has been implemented.  Thorough inspections, (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) are performed and deviations or deficiencies corrected immediately.  Standard Maintenance Procedures (SMPs) and Preventative Maintenance Procedures (PMPs) have been written for all maintenance and inspection activities and are reviewed annually to ensure that they are current. \n\nManagement of Change - \n\nOur management of change procedure is in place, however, during the past five years, work performed on the system has only been \"replacement in kind\". \n\nPre-Startup"

A checklist has been developed and is used to ensure safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\nCompliance Audits - \n\nAudits are conducted every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits implemented immediately.  The latest inspection was conducted by FL DEM and separately a consultant, D.E.I., Inc. in July 2018. \n\nIncident Investigation - \n\nThere is a program in place to promptly investigate any incident that resulted in, or had the potential for, an accidental release of ammonia.  The program is designed to identify root causes and indicate preventative measures to prevent a re-occurrence.  The reports are maintained on file for the life of the process.\n\nEmployee Participation - \n\nEvery employee involved in the process has participated in all phases of the establishment of the Risk Management Program.  They have also participated in the audits and PHAs as well.  Each employee is dedicated to the prevention of product releases and subsequent potential injuries to themselves, their coworkers, the surrounding community and the environment. \n\nContractors - \n\nA procedure for reviewing the safety performance and past safety history of any contractor hired to work on or with the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system has been developed and will be followed.  The policy includes an obligation to inform the contractor of the hazards they and their workers will be exposed to as well as emergency response procedures.  An annual performance evaluation system to ensure that the Contractor adheres to the company safety and health policies is contained within the procedures.\n\n4.
