A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices.  Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including any release of a hazardous material.  Key employees are trained in prevention and responses for rapid and effective action should an accident occur.\r\n\r\nPerdue has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans at each facility as part of an overall chemical management program.  The program involves a wide range of personnel.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to its staff.\r\n\r\nAccident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nPerdue Georgetown has complied with Delaware's Accidental Release Prevention Regulation (formerly Extremely Hazardous Substance Risk Management Act) since its promulgation in 1989 and the OSHA Process Safety Management Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 since its inception in 1992.  Up-to-date process information such as equipment information, piping and instrument diagrams and Safety Data Sheets are kept onsite.  Employee participation includes operating and maintenance procedures development, review and training.  Contractors are required to submit qualification statements of competency.  Process Hazard Analyses with recommendations have been done, and corrective actions taken. Regular mechanical integrity inspections are cmpleted.  In addition, Perdue performs internal audits on its PSM processes. \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has been one on-site release that occurred on July 23, 2017 involving anhydrous ammonia.  Approximately 243 pounds of ammonia was released through a faulty relief valve. This incident at the Perdue Georgetown"

The facility has a trained HAZWOPER (HAZardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) team that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release or other emergency situation.  The Plan contains specific information regarding emergency response organization and procedures, as well as incident notification, mitigation and incident preparedness.  Evacuation exercises are conducted, and drills are scheduled.  Perdue Georgetown is a member of the Sussex County Local Emergency Planning Committee.     \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPerdue continues to make improvements to the ammonia refrigeration systems and to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety and quality.   Currently, planned improvements include change out of all pressure-relief valves over a five-year cycle.   Other potential improvements will be based on annual inspections, audits, process hazard analyses and/or mechanical integrity inspections."

This facility is the primary source of production for roasters.  Perdue purchased this facility in 1978 and started operations in January 1979.  The facility is sited on about 70 acres on the north side of town, east of the town circle, about \u00bd mile north of Route 9.  It is bounded by some residences and farmland.  The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, 5 days per week.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management and through 7 Delaware Code Chapter 77 (Accidental Release Prevention Regulation) where Delaware administers EPA 40 CFR Part 68 for Chemical Action Prevention Provisions.   It is used onsite for chilling processes and refrigeration of product. The Georgetown facility has four separate ammonia systems ranging from 7,400 pounds to 30,000 pounds.  In each system, ammonia is distributed throughout the components (compressors, condensers, evaporators, etc.).  Each system has equipment both inside and outside the facility.   The total ammonia storage in all four systems onsite is 72,600 pounds.\r\n\r\nPeracetic acid is onsite and used as an antimicrobial agent in the organic chicken process. It is applied to the chicken via dip tanks, sprays, chillers, and various other methods approved by the USDA. There is one 5,500 gallon tank at the facility. However, the vapor pressure of the peracetic acid is below 10 mmHg @25C; therefore, not subject to the threshold determination and not included in the RMP.  \r\n \r\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Peracetic Acid are regulated under CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Perdue facilities are located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen"
