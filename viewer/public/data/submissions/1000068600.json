      "SummaryText": "The Cargill Meat Solutions - Fort Morgan, CO primary business is processing wholesale distribution of meat products for human consumption. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh. 40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The refrigeration system inventory exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP was updated in February 2018 to meet the 5 year RMP resubmission criteria. The overall quantity onsite was increased to reflect more accurate methods to calculate the worst case and normal operating quantities onsite. There was not processing or plant expansion that took place which would have increased the total onsite quantity. Rather, the methodologies used for inventory calculations improved and are reflected now in the RMP revision. \n\n\n\nFacility release modeling was performed using EPA's modeling program RMP*Comp in addition to ALOHA software. The methodologies reported in CDX reflect conservative modeling approaches to meet the endpoint criteria. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is based on the High Side as that vessel could potentially hold the largest quantity of ammonia. No passive or administrative controls were considered for the release scenario. For the worst case scenario, smaller quantities handled at higher process temperature or pressure were considered. The report and supporting information contained herein only specify the final selected worst-case scenario. \n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario was a release from a Pipe leak. No passive or administrative controls were considered for the release scenario. Other alternate cases were considered, including vessel overfilling, over pressurization scenarios, pipe ruptures and material handling, and transfer hoses. Alternate release sce"

      "SummaryText": "narios including shipping container mishandling, breakage, or puncturing that could lead to a spill were not considered because the facility does not handle shipping containers containing anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications. All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/ RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan. Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system. The facility has an emergency action plan in place and conducts periodic response drills and coordinates with the local fire department and LEPC. The facility is committed to continually improving safety through program implementation and execution. The facility has not experienced a release incident that meets the EPA's 5 Year Accident Reporting criteria involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides. In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down. The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The shutdown can be manually operated using a switch located outside the engine room.\n\n"
