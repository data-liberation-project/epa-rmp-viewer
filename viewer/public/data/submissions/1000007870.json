In July 2007, Blue Ridge Holding was purchased by The Rank Group.  For marketing purposes, Blue Ridge Paper Products Inc is doing business as (dba) Evergreen Packaging. This resubmission continues to identify the Canton Mill as BLUE RIDGE based on the legal name of this facility.\n\nThe Blue Ridge Paper Products, Inc. (BLUE RIDGE) Canton Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Canton Mill workers, the public, and the environment. The Canton Mill has operated under environmental and workplace health and safety policies that serve as guiding principles for it's employees and operations. BLUE RIDGE strives to minimize the environmental impacts of all our operations, processes, and products in a manner responsive to the needs of our shareholders, customers, employees, the communities in which we operate, and the public.\"\n\nAs part of this commitment, BLUE RIDGE has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at BLUE RIDGE and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs\" (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at BLUE RIDGE.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at BLUE RIDGE.\n\nThe risk management program at BLUE RIDGE consists of three elements:\n1.

An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at BLUE RIDGE helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at BLUE RIDGE.  In fact, BLUE RIDGE has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nBLUE RIDGE limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at BLUE RIDGE, less hazardous alternatives are considered. Part of BLUE RIDGE'S RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, BLUE RIDGE considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect BLUE RIDGE workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nBLUE RIDGE works to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at BLUE RIDGE, the equipment is designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nBLUE RIDGE limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.

This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at BLUE RIDGE that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBLUE RIDGE is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  BLUE RIDGE implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at BLUE RIDGE; and programs to evaluate the hazards at BLUE RIDGE.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, BLUE RIDGE controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help limit injury to the public or the environment.  BLUE RIDGE provides response training to BLUE RIDGE personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department. The Canton Mill maintains an Emergency Response Team that is trained and equipped to respond to on-site chemical releases. The Manager, Safety and Loss Prevention serves as the Vice-Chairman of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Response activities have also been discussed with the local emergency response agencies and citizens from the community.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, BLUE RIDGE established a management system headed by the mill's Operations Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 BLUE RIDGE and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Canton Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill pri"

Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Analysis descriptions are included in the RMPlan.\n\n \n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \n\nThe Canton Mill has always focused on ways to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the Canton Mill formally implemented the 14 elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements.  BLUE RIDGE has implemented the prevention program requirements, which are as follows:\n\nProgram 3 level processes - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  Program 3 requires 12 of the 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulation.  This prevention program has been established for the Chlorine Dioxide System and Chlorine Water Treatment System\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of BLUE RIDGE'S prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements. \n\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Canton Mill Program 3 prevention program, which applies to the Chlorine Dioxide System and the Chlorine Water Treatment System processes, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.

This process safety information is available to all BLUE RIDGE employees, and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the properties of hazardous substances handled at BLUE RIDGE, including regulated substances in covered processes.  Information on the technology and engineering design of the covered processes include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the process equipment.\n\nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects or, in the case of operating parameters, during process hazard analyses of the process.  Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.\n\n2.     Process Hazard Analysis. The Canton Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.

BLUE RIDGE operators, process engineers and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\nBLUE RIDGE personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.  The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the covered processes and as a training guide for both new and experienced operators.  Operating procedures are updated at least annually to ensure they reflect current operating conditions.\n\n4.    Training. The mill trains workers to perform their assigned tasks safely and effectively. The BLUE RIDGE training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the process operation prior to job assignment.\n\nThe operators are consulted annually during operating procedure reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of procedures being utilized and the need for additional training.

Management of Change.  The BLUE RIDGE management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a management of change form.  All other changes must be reviewed through the full management of change program, to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n7.    Pre-startup Review.  BLUE RIDGE performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process is safe to operate.  This review confirms that an employee has completed the requisite training.  The review also confirms that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications.  A pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n8.    Compliance Audit.

The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n10.    Employee Participation.  The Canton Mill developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that BLUE RIDGE workers participate in the development and continuous improvement of these prevention program elements. Employees are consulted on and informed about various aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures. \n\n11.    Hot Work Permits.  BLUE RIDGE uses a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Canton Mill. BLUE RIDGE reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Operations Shift Supervisor and Maintenance Shift Supervisor initiates the hot work process by observing the area where hot work will be performed.  Fire Control personnel review the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of t"

      "SummaryText": "he Hot Work Permit Form is included in the BLUE RIDGE safe work practices orientation and mandatory annual safety training.  The Factory Mutual \"Red Tag\" system provides oversight concerning fire system valve closures.\n\n12.    Contractors.  BLUE RIDGE has established Contractor Guidelines for Safety and Health to outline expectations related to contractor work, at the Canton Mill including work on the covered processes.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that BLUE RIDGE only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  BLUE RIDGE explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, BLUE RIDGE safe work practices, and BLUE RIDGE emergency response procedures.  BLUE RIDGE requires that the contractor supervisors also train each of their employees prior to beginning their work on a covered process.  BLUE RIDGE periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed. \n\n1.4.2 Program 2 Prevention Program\n\nThe Canton Mill has no processes, which qualify for Program 2 Prevention Program\n\n1.4.3 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, BLUE RIDGE has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at BLUE RIDGE.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features. \n\nExample-Chlorine.   Chlorine is supplied to the Blue Ridge Paper Products, Inc. (BLUE RIDGE) Canton Mill in DOT-approved 1-ton containers. Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in areas where chlorine could be present if a release occurs. These alarms sound at the chlorine area, and also on operator control displays in the Generator Control Room and Plant Security office, which are constantly monitored to help ensure quick response. \n\nExample-Chlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide gas is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to a water a"

      "SummaryText": "bsorber column, where a 1.2% wt chlorine dioxide solution is generated. Chlorine dioxide is produced at the BLUE RIDGE-Canton Mill and stored as a dilute water solution to avoid transporting large quantities of the solution.  Storing the chemical in a water solution greatly reduces the potential for off-site impact.  Containment sewers are provided in all areas where chlorine dioxide is used. Detectors and alarms provide continuous monitoring in all areas where the potential for chlorine dioxide exists, providing early detection and helping to ensure a quick response in the event of a leak.\n\nMill security personnel utilizing the EST-3 mill-wide alarm systems centrally monitor area control panels for specific gas detection.  Detection equipment is calibrated monthly to ensure accurate measurements are received.\n\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\n\nBLUE RIDGE has completed a five-year accident history that indicates continued improvement in safe operations at BLUE RIDGE.  The results of that review are listed in the table below.\n\nYear    Number of\n    Accidents    Substance Released    Consequences\n\n2004    0\n\n2005    0\n\n2006    0\n\n2007    1        Chlorine Dioxide        Worker Injury\n\n2008    0\n\n2009    0\n\nNOTE:  The amount released in the 2007 injury was .08 lbs.  RMP Submit would not allow numbers less than 1.\n\n\n\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\n\nBLUE RIDGE has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n*     Informing the local fire department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n*    Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances at BLUE RIDGE\n*     Controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\n*     Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n*     Reviewing and updating the"

      "SummaryText": " emergency response plan\n\nThe Canton Mill maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All BLUE RIDGE personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  BLUE RIDGE periodically conducts emergency response drills. The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)) and has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department.  BLUE RIDGE maintains a regular dialogue with the local fire chief, and BLUE RIDGE provides appropriate information to the fire chief. \n\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Canton Mill constantly strives to improve the safety of the processes through both the incident investigation program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  The following changes to improve process safety are planned or have recently been completed.\n\n* A state-of-the-art mill wide fire alarm and emergency communication system was completed in June 2000.  Monitoring capability was recently added to the facility Medical Department which is staffed 24/7 by NC EMT-Paramedics.  This provides quick notice to the on-onsite medical personnel that an incident may have occurred.\n* On-going training of mill emergency response personnel provides the resources needed for immediate response to any type emergency.  This includes HAZ-MAT personnel trained at OSHA \"Technician\" level and paramedics to provide immediate advanced life support for employees and offsite citizens that might be exposed.\n* The Haywood County LEPC implemented a community notification system in early 2004 utilizing the Community Alert Network (CAN) process.  The system has the capability of contacting 500 telephones per minute with timely information including instructions for citizens to follow if needed.  BLUE RIDGE personnel played a key role in implementing this system.\n* Haywood County formed a Local Em"
