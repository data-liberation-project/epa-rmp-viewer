This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the small initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC - Star Terminal is a butane transloading facility (specifically, railcar to truck tanker).  This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane transfer systems only, including the associated piping and thirty (30) approximate 30,000 gallon storage tanks detached railcars.  \n\nThis facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one (1) of the transloading system's 30,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate (feasible scenario affecting off-site receptors) release scenario is a BLEVE incident involving one (1) railcar resulting in a fireball.\n\nThe Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC - Star Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
