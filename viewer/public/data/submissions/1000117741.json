      "SummaryText": "Facility Overview:\nThe Home Market Foods, Inc. (Home Market Foods) facility, located at 140\nMorgan Drive, Norwood, Massachusetts (the Property), produces and distributes\nquality meat products. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to\nmaintain the proper temperature in support of production needs and for storing\nthe product until distribution. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that\nhas been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is\nnormally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas that is liquefied\nunder pressure. The refrigeration system consists of pressure vessels,\nevaporators, compressors, piping and other refrigeration equipment. The same\nproperties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also make it necessary to\nobserve certain safety precautions during its use to prevent exposure to workers,\nthe surrounding community, and the environment. Please refer to Figure 1 for\nthe location of Property.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nHome Market Foods is committed to promoting safety for the facility, its\nemployees and the area surrounding its facility. Home Market Foods complies\nwith the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) Process Safety\nManagement Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.110 and\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA) Risk Management\nProgram (RM Program) Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\nThe purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is\noperated safely to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, the\nHome Market Foods operational procedures are established within formulated\nregulatory guidelines, outlining appropriate emergency action steps to take in the\nevent of a release.\n\nFive Year Update:\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was originally developed in September 2004\nby American Refrigeration, Inc. for Home Market Foods.

This 2024 update includes reporting of an accidental release which\noccurred in December 2022 and updated worst case and alternate case\nscenarios.\n\nRegulated Substance:\nHome Market Foods operates a refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous\nammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical refrigeration is a\nthermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat\nexchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment.\nThe refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation, compression, condensation and\nexpansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of\nenergy associated with the refrigerant. Compression and expansion are\ndesigned to change the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration\ncycle is a closed-loop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature,\npressure and latent heat of vaporization for cooling. The refrigeration system\nuses this phenomenon to remove heat from a desired space, and then to discard\nthat heat through condensation.\nHome Market Foods operates its main machine room (having compressors,\ncondenser, receivers), as well as the low pressure side of the system\n(pump receivers, coil evaporators, water chillers and coolers) to maintain\nprocessing, freezer and holding room temperatures required for manufacturing of\nand storage of their product. There are approximately 400 employees that work\nat the Home Market Foods facility, including hourly and salary personnel that\nsupport manufacturing and logistics relating to product preparation and product\nshipment. Home Market Foods operates approximately 24 hours a day, five\ndays a week.\nAggregate ammonia storage is 25,592 pounds (lbs)."

      "SummaryText": "The potential hazards that\ncould lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited to,\nequipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nAs a part of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program, Home\nMarket Foods has established numerous programs that serve to prevent\naccidental releases of ammonia. The programs include:\n? Process Safety Information;\n? Process Hazard Analysis;\n? Operating Procedures;\n? Training;\n? Mechanical Integrity;\n? Management of Change;\n? Pre Startup Safety Review;\n? Compliance Audits;\n? Third Party Audits;\n? Incident Investigation;\n? Natural Hazards and Power Loss;\n? Facility Siting;\n? Community Notification of RMP Accidents;\n? Employee Participation;\n? Hot Work Permits; and\n? Contractor Safety.\n\nEmergency Response Information:\nAs a part of the PSM Program, Home Market Foods maintains an Emergency\nAction Plan that was prepared to improve responsiveness to an emergency\nincident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident. The\nplan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and\nmedical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response\nagencies as well as the public. In the event of an emergency involving the\nammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary\nby calling 911.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nOn December 19, 2022, there was a vapor release of ammonia of approximately\n21,750 pounds. The release resulted in one (1) serious injury and one (1) death.\nRefer to Appendix B Accident Response Reporting for detailed information.\nAdditionally, on September 3, 2024 there was a liquid release of ammonia of\napproximately 721 pounds.
