      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Leedey Refrigeration Plant (Leedey) has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  The CenterPoint Energy policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCenterPoint Energy operates Leedey located in Custer County, Oklahoma.  Leedey is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant designed for the extraction of Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) from a gas stream. The cryogenic extraction plant recovers LPG, which is comprised of ethane, propane, butanes, and heavier hydrocarbons, from the inlet gas.  LPG from the liquid extraction plant is delivered via a pipeline.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, Leedey is a Program 1 process.\n\nLeedey was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n                                                                                                                                                                            CenterPoint identified one regulated flammable substance (LPG, flammable liquid mixture) and zero regulated toxic substances along with the largest vessel quantity stored.  It was d"

      "SummaryText": "etermined that a single vessel of the flammable liquid mixture exceeded threshold quantity.  The identification of this exceedance indicates that Leedey is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nLeedey has not had any accidental releases during the past five years which meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\nLeedey has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).  Although Leedey is not required by 40 CFR 68 to have its own emergency response plan, operators are equipped with an Emergency Plan Book that gives the procedures to follow in case of an emergency."
