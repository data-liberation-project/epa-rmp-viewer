Preventing accidents related to welding and cutting while alerting others at the facility that this type of work is occurring are important prevention steps.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  CornerStone Packing & Cooling has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n5.Five-year Accident History\nCornerStone Packing & Cooling has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental releases during this period. Any reportable release requires updating the Accident History within 6 months.\n\n6.Emergency Action Plan\nCornerStone Packing & Cooling has a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Our employees will not enter a hazardous area. Two SCBA's are on-site for use with other chemicals and 2 employees trained in their use for emergency rescue/escape only. The plan includes all aspects of emergency actions to evaluate the need for additional resources, provide safety for employees, notify public agencies and effectively support responding resources. We have regular training and encourage questions.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency and safety equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCornerStone Packing & Cooling conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCornerStone Packing & Cooling promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. Any incidents that release a reportable amount of Ammonia require updating the 5 year Accident History and filing a revised RMP with the EPA.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCornerStone Packing & Cooling truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  RMP Comp was used to determine DTE based on a release with the largest vessel full.  Specific details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rulemaking. The potential population impacted estimate decreased slightly using the 2010 Census and Marplot.\n\nAlternate case scenario has also been evaluated and included. This release was typical for a compressor shaft seal.\n\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps-\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.

Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training demonstrates this commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale storage and processing of tree fruit, citrus and storage.  This activity is consistent with SIC 0723. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to use as a refrigerant. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system.  The safety systems include an Ammonia a diffusion tank, NH3 detection, emergency ventilation, safety relief valves, redundant controls, emergency shower/eyewash, emergency escape devices in the mechanical room and appropriate cutouts. This is consistent with a Program 3 process.\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario mandate"
