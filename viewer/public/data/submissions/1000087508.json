The process boundary does not include the storage of railcars of sulfur trioxide when they are not staged at the offloading area. (e.g. storage in a fenced enclosure located on the southwest corner of the Millsdale plant.)\n\n\n\nAll five sulfonation units have an automated emergency shutdown system.  Similarly, the rail car and truck unloading stations have automated features and emergency shut down buttons that will stop transfers.  The sulfur trioxide rail cars are staged at an  unloading area that is manned during transfers and monitored remotely using a video camera. \n\n\n\nThe S03 storage tanks are located inside of an enclosed building without sprinkler protection.  The five reactors are located inside of buildings that have sprinkler protection. \n\n\n\nThe rail car and truck unloading is done outside.",

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nStepan Company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Stepan Company employees, contractors, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, Stepan Company has established operations and management systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage chemical risk at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant and complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule). One of the requirements associated with the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at  Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements associated with the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nStepan Company is committed to the safety of Stepan Company employees, contractors, the public, and preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. Stepan Company implements controls to prevent releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a chemical release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases. Stepan Company evaluates each situation, evacuates employees as necessary, and contacts the local fire department to control and contain the release to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release. The Millsdale Plant will also contact Will County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) to assist with emergency management if necessary.\n\n\n\nWill County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) has established a Chemical Emergency Preparedness Plan to coordinate emergency response ac"

The community is notified of the situation and what action to take via telephone.\n\n\n\nStepan Company's Millsdale facility conducts training and practice exercises on a regular basis to assure effectiveness of the emergency response program.\n\n\n\n1.2 The Stepan Company and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nStepan Company is a major manufacturer of specialty and intermediate chemicals used in a broad range of industries. Stepan Company is a leading merchant producer of surfactants that are the key ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning compounds. Manufacturers of detergents, shampoos, lotions, toothpastes, and cosmetics depend on surfactants to achieve the foaming and cleaning qualities of their products. Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant handles four (4) substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the regulation.\n\n\n\nMillsdale utilizes Sulfur Trioxide that is divided into three processes: the Millsdale Plant Sulfonation process, the Process Technology Department (PTD) sulfonation process, and the storage of SO3 railcars (along with Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide) in a secure location.\n\n\n\nThe Millsdale Plant receives sulfur trioxide (SO3) by rail car or truck, stored on site, and can be used in up to five (5) sulfonation units. The sulfonation processes receive sulfur trioxide from bulk storage tanks, vaporizes the liquid SO3 in a process air stream and reacts it to form sulfated and sulfonated acid products. These products may be sold to customers for the production of detergents and cleaning products or further processed within Stepan Company.  Sulfur trioxide (SO3) is also delivered to the Millsdale Plant via truck for use in the Process\n\nTechnology Department (PTD). The PTD uses sulfur trioxide to manufacture various sulfonic acids on a smaller scale than the production processe"

Sulfur trioxide is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\nFuming Sulfuric acid (oleum) is a byproduct created during the Millsdale Plant sulfonation process and is stored in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP Rule. Oleum is stored in up to 3 storage tanks on site, none of which exceed 5,000 gallons. Oleum is diluted to form non-fuming sulfuric acid and the non-fuming sulfuric acid is  transported off site for sale or disposal. The PTD does not generate or store sufficient quantities of oleum to be covered by the RMP rule. Oleum is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule. The physical properties of Sulfur Tiroxide (a toxic liquid) were used as a conservative basis for modeling purposes, as oleum has fuming behavior due to free sulfur trioxide being present in solution.\n\n\n\nEthylene oxide (EO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the alkoxylation process. The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers, used as a raw material for the sulfonation process, or used as a raw material for polymer manufacturing. Ethylene oxide is classified as a toxic gas in the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\nPropylene oxide (PO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the alkoxylation process. The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers, used as a raw material for the sulfonation process, or used as a raw material for polymer manufacturing. Propylene oxide is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\nThe storage of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and sulfur trioxide railcars within a secure location occurs when the cars are not ready to unload. The area has a separate emergency access road and can be monitored via camera.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the use of regulated substances at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant, the above processes are covered by the RMP rule.
