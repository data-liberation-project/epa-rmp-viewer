The primary activity is the storage and transfer of fertilizers. The maximum quantity stored would be 167,000 pounds divided a 26,000 gallon storage tank and a 12,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case release would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity store would be 114,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to endpoint (dispersion to 200 PPM) is 2.32 miles. The alternate release scenairo based on the five year accident history or most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .83 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI K-61 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111. We have also complied with the EPA, DOT and the Kansas Department of Agriculture who inspects our facilities on annual basis. These standards and regulations along with the safety culture and training our employees have been through have helped us acheive an outstanding safety record.\n\nThere have been no acciendental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has written an emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA and we report our regualted materials to the Community Right to Know program, the local fire department and the County LEPC.
