      "SummaryText": "The Willard Water Plant uses chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  Chlorine is used at this facility as a disinfectant to kill harmful bacteria, viruses or pathogens that may be present in the public drinking water.  The equipment has always been maintained as required by the manufacturer specifications to ensure a safe operation.  Our emergency response is based on the Chlorine Institute Pamphlte 64, \"Emergency Response Plan for Chlorine Facilities.\" The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n     The primary purpose of the Water Treatment Plant is to supply clean, safe drinking water to approximately 9400 area residents that are served by our Distribution System.  The Water Plant is located at 540 Central Avenue, Willard, OH 44890, and is a Municipally owned and operated plant.  The inventory of chlorine stored at this loaction is 3000 pounds.\n     We are required to report a worst cass scenario using 150 pound chlorine cylinders.  Our scenario is a catastrophic failure due to corrosion, impact or a construction defect.  The amount of chlorine that would be released is 150 pounds, which would be 15 pounds per minute assuming a 10 minute duration in an urban area.  The distance to end point or effected area would be at 77'F with the conversion factor to reflect the true temperature of 1.0123 x 1.2 miles which would be a total effected radius from the Water Plant of 1.21 miles or 6400 feet.  This was modeled as a direct release over 10 minute period as required by the regulations.  However, such a small quantity of chlorine may vaporize sooner if the cylinder is instantaneous.  there is an alarm system on the process to alert employees of the least amount of chlorine loss.  There is also an automatic shut-off in the event of power failure to shut down the process and stop the flow of chlorine.  The chlorine process is in a separate room with an ou"

In the event of a release the chlorine can be contained in the process room and discharged at a lower rate by the use of an exhaust system.\n     Should a release escape the confines of the treatment faciity there are certain natural continment areas around the Plant.  To the North is a low lying area along a small embankment.  To the East is a tall embankment along a State highway.  To the South is a wooded area.  All these would aid in slowing or containing the release thus giving time to take the necessary precautions to protect and secure the community and our neighbors.  The estimated population that would be affected in the worst case scenario would be 6000.\n     We are also required to report an alternative worst case scenario using a 150 pound chlorine cylinder.  There is a bad connection, a failure of the valve to close, results in a release of gas through a 1/16 inch diameter hole.  The amount of chlorine that is released is 17.1 pounds which is an approximate .44 pounds per minute for a duration of 60 minutes.  The distance to end point for the affected area would be .091 miles or 480 feet.  The estimated population that may be affected in the alternative worst case scenario would be 150.  This scenario was modeled as a release from a vertical cylinder tank with the release occuring through a hole in the middle of the top of the tank.  The chlorine escapes only as a gas.  As discussed in our worst case scenario there are certain natural barriers that would contain a possible release.  In the event of a release in either release scenario there may be impacts to off-site receptors such as:  residential areas, indutry, commercial, schools,hospitals, nursing homes,parks and office areas.  We have taken every precaution to ensure that such a release does not happen.  The information in these scenarios was taken from the EPA Off-Site Consequence Quidance document.\n     The Willard Water Plant has always complied with all regulations to ensure th"

We follow all EPA regulations, and have bassed our safety program after OSHA recommendations.  We have participated in Department of Safety and Hygiene audits to help us comply and make our facility safe.  Before an employee can work on the process he must be trained.  This training consists of classroom, on the job, and hands on training.  All employees that work at this process are certified by the EPA and are required to have continuing training credits to keep their certification. \n     The Willard Water Plant has had no accidental release in the past five years.  employees are trained to handle minor leaks and repairs.  In the event of a major release employees are to call 911.  The local Fire Department will respond and if necessary will call the Huron County Local Emergency Planning Commision, for assistance and help if evacuation is necessary.  All Employees will continue to update their training.  We have lowered chlorine inventory to help minimize the effects if a release should occur.  All opertional as well as safety procedures have been reviewed to make sure that the needs of our process and that employees will continue to operate and maintain equipment as required."
