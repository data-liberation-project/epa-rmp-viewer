              "Description": "The following is brief summary of the prevention program in place at Moorhead Water Treatment Plant to reduce the risk of a chlorine release.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nMoorhead Public Service recognizes that it is essential to involve its employees in the development and implementation of an OSHA PSM and EPA RMProgram at all Moorhead Public Service facilities subject to the OSHA PSM and/or EPA RMP regulations. The purpose of this plan is to define how employees will be involved.\n\nEmployees have been significantly involved in the development of the prevention program, especially in the areas of process hazard analysis, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures. They have been trained on and encouraged to review all areas of the prevention program.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nComplete and up-to-date process safety information is required to successfully implement most RMProgram elements, including PHAs, training, emergency planning and response, management of change, incident investigation, and compliance audits. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that current written process safety information is developed and maintained in a format that provides easy access by employees, PHA teams, and auditors.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nMoorhead Public Service has conducted Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) using What If/Checklist to identify, evaluate, and control the risk associated with process hazards or highly hazardous chemical (HHC) release scenarios at all Moorhead Public Service facilities subject to the OSHA PSM and/or EPA RMP regulations. The overall purpose of the PHA was to comply with these regulations and to prevent or minimize the effects of a chemical release. Recommendations were made during the PHA to reduce the risk associated with a hazard or release scenario to an acceptable level.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that Moorhead Water Plant maintains up-to-date, accurate, written OPs that provide clear instructions for all covered processes. Effective OPs, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the systems and preventing accidental releases.\n\nPERSONNEL TRAINING\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that personnel working on or near OSHA PSM and/or EPA RMP-regulated processes are adequately trained and understand the inherent process hazards and appropriate response actions to accidental chemical releases. Regulated processes at the facility include the chlorination processes.\n\nCONTRACTOR SAFETY\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that only contractors with good health and safety programs are selected to perform work on and around processes that use highly hazardous chemicals, and that the contractors and the processes are properly prepared to safely complete the work. Processes that use highly hazardous chemicals currently include the chlorine processes.\n\nPRESTARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nA Prestartup Safety Review (PSSR) will be performed for new processes regulated under OSHA PSM and EPA RMP, and modified existing regulated processes when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that the facility is ready to safely operate new and modified regulated processes.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe purpose of the mechanical integrity program is to ensure the continued integrity of process equipment. An effective mechanical integrity program is integral to preventing accidental chemical releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment. The program follows manufacturer's recommendations for maintenance on equipment.\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that a hot work permit is issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the chlorine processes. Hot work is defined as any work that may generate a source of ignition and includes but is not limited to welding, torch cutting, and use of spark-producing equipment.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe purpose of the Management of Change (MoC) procedure is to ensure that system changes are properly reviewed against original system design specifications and can be accomplished safely, and that the systems are ready to operate safely in accordance with original system design intent following implementation of the change.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nAll incidents at the Moorhead Water Plant, which resulted in or could have reasonably resulted in a release of chlorine, will be promptly investigated. The purpose of the incident investigation procedure is to identify the underlying causes of an incident and to implement corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nThe purpose of compliance audits is to ensure audits are performed to evaluate Moorhead Water Plant process safety and risk management programs, and their implementation for compliance with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations. Whenever necessary, the audit will identify recommendations to address program deficiencies.",

It contains the information called for in Section 68.155 of the rule.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe accidental release prevention policies are represented in Sections 2 through 13.  The emergency response policy is represented in Sections 14.  Moorhead Public Service takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at this facility by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of processes subject to the Part 68 rule.  They are also trained in the safe handling of all chemicals that are regulated substances under the rule.\n\nIn addition to ensure the adequate training of its employees, Moorhead Public Service works to prevent accidents by providing and revising as needed written procedures for operating its covered processes under the rule.  Although these procedures in and of themselves should prevent accidental releases, Moorhead Public Service maintains and follows a policy of compliance audits, the goals of which are to determine if existing procedures are adequate and, if they are, to ensure that they are followed.\n\nMoorhead Public Service has also developed and maintained a risk management policy that contains general safety rules.  The general safety rules fall under Minnesota's Chapter 182 Occupational Safety and Health Act.  The safety and health program is required to meet Minnesota's Workplace Accident and Incident Reduction (AWAIR) Law. This program covers topics such as personal protection equipment, hazard communications, confined space, respiratory protection, excavation and trenching, lock-out/tag-out, and bloodborne disease exposure control.  Although these general rules do not specifically address the covered processes and their regulated substances, compliance with the general"

These manuals for this program are available to all Moorhead Public Service employees in the control room of the Moorhead Water Treatment Plant. \n\nAs for emergency response, Moorhead Public Service has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.  Moorhead Public Service's response to a release is to notify the Moorhead Fire Department.  The City of Moorhead Fire Department and the City of Fargo, North Dakota Fire Department jointly operate and maintain a common HAZMAT team. \n\nMoorhead Public Service management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment at this facility and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in this document.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Moorhead WTP treats surface water from the Red Rivers and ground water from several aquifers to provide drinking water to the community.  It does this through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations that include: \n\n  >Lime softening\n  >Ozone disinfection\n  >Filtration\n  >Secondary disinfection with chloramines\n\nThe treated water, now ready for use by the public, is transferred to a large reservoir and pumped into the distribution system.  The design capacity of the treatment plants is 16 million gallons per day.\n\nThe regulated substance stored, handled, and used at this facility is chlorine. The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 4 containers on site.  All of the containers are stored inside of a building.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the sto"

No active mitigation measures or devices, such as scrubbers, could be considered for analysis of worst-case releases.\n\nFor this worst-case release scenario, the regulation specifies the release conditions and meteorological conditions at the time of the release.  When these conditions were modeled, using the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) program, the results were as follows:\n\nChlorine worst-case release scenario\n\n  >Quantity released = 2,000 pounds\n  >Release duration = 10 minutes\n  >Release rate = 220 pounds per minute\n  >Distance to endpoint = 2.3 miles\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, described in detail in Appendix 5 of this document, the following results were obtained:\n\nChlorine alternative release scenario\n\n  >Quantity released = 317 pounds\n  >Release duration = 60 minutes\n  >Release rate = 10.6 pounds per minute\n  >Distance to end point = 0.40 mile\n\nThese scenarios are described in greater detail in Section 4.0, Process Hazard Analysis.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR COVERED CHEMICALS\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in Section 2 through Section 13 of this document.  In accordance with the Part 68 rule, the prevention program contains the following sections:\n\n  >Employee participation\n  >Process safety information\n  >Process hazard analysis\n  >Operating procedures\n  >Personnel training\n  >Contractor safety\n  >Prestartup safety review\n  >Mechanical Integrity\n  >Hot work permits\n  >Management of change\n  >Incident investigation\n  >Compliance audits\n\nThe prevention program elements that are most critical in preventing accidental releases in this facility include employee training, both formal and on-the-job; written operating procedures for all to use who operate or maintain the covered processes; and a process equipment preventive maintenance program.\n\nShould the prevention program fail to prevent a release, the WTP is equipped with engineeri"

The chlorine containers are kept inside of a building to mitigate the effects of the release.  But more important, the plant has installed a scrubber capable of neutralizing one ton of chlorine, the amount stored in the largest single container onsite.  The scrubber is maintained on a regular basis to ensure proper operation if needed during a chlorine release.  Our WTP also has a 500 kW generator for back-up power for the chlorine scrubber.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances from this facility during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies, such as the Moorhead Fire Department, which is part of the local HAZMAT team along with the City of Fargo, North Dakota.  The program is described in detail in Section 14 of this document.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of the releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  It is also submitted to the Fire Department for review and comment.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVED SAFETY\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of this RMP document, hazard reviews were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.
