Integral to the manufacture of these products are three toxic chemicals (anhydrous ammonia, phosphorus oxychloride and trimethylchlorosilane) and four flammable chemicals (acetylene, dichlorosilane, pentane and trichlorosilane).  SiVance inventory may exceed the USEPA listed thresholds under the Risk Management Plan (RMP), codified at 40 CFR 68, for the above referenced materials. SiVance has implemented an RMP program.  SiVance has an outstanding record in environmental, health and safety performance.  The following sections outline the SiVance RMP program.\n\n\n\nOVERALL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nThe SiVance Site Manager has overall responsibility for the RMP program at the facility with the assistance of the Environmental Safety and Health (ESH) Manager.  They share the overall responsibility for ensuring that the facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  A primary responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the RMP program.  To ensure the RMP is appropriately developed and implemented, SiVance's ownership has assigned the duties of RMP Coordinator to the Site Manager, an individual who has the necessary background, training, and experience for that duty.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with proper authority, has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the USEPA RMP elements.  In addition, the RMP Coordinator works closely with appropriate staff to integrate the appropriate elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program as required by Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe following sections identify the specific responsibilities for various aspects of the RMP and PSM programs.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe ESH Manager has the responsibility for (1) ensuring the off-site consequence analysis for the regulated processes are consistently performed and documented in accordance with Sections 68.20 through 68"

SiVance has had no reportable release of any of the RMP regulated substances since 2001.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe RMP Coordinator and those staff members assigned PSM responsibility, have the responsibility of ensuring that the facility has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets or exceeds Section 68.65 through 68.87 of the RMP rule and OSHA PSM requirements.  The Site Manager ensures that staff delegated RMP and PSM responsibilities for all program elements are assigned and maintained.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for process safety information, Section 68.65 of the RMP rule.  Process chemical information, process equipment information and process technology information are readily accessible for use.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS\n\nIn accordance with RMP Section 68.57, the RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for scheduling, conducting, and documenting that the PHAs were completed by trained personnel for the covered processes.  The RMP Coordinator has delegated this responsibility to the ESH Manager (and prior to June 2019 to the Process Safety Manager) who designates appropriately trained personnel from within the facility to participate in the PHAs. The RMP Coordinator may select outside contractors to lead the PHAs.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nIn accordance with RMP Section 68.71, the Site Manager must ensure that complete and accurate operating procedures are in place for the regulated processes. The Site Manager works with the ESH Manager to develop and maintain the facility's safe work practice"

The ESH Manager and the Site Manager share the responsibility for (1) ensuring that all employees receive and understand training in safe work practices applicable to their jobs and (2) documenting said training.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nIn accordance with RMP Section 68.73, the Engineering Services Manager has responsibility for the overall mechanical integrity program, with specific emphasis on written procedures, maintenance training, the equipment and instrumentation inspection/testing program and documentation, and equipment deficiency resolution.  SiVance employs contractors and/or consultants to assist in the implementation and maintenance of the mechanical integrity program.  The Engineering Services Manager works with appropriate maintenance personnel to define and maintain quality assurance procedures for equipment acquisitions/installation/repairs.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nIn accordance with RMP Section 68.75, the ESH Manager has responsibility for the management of change (MOC) program; however, the facility engineering staff and operations management have responsibility for ensuring that the overall MOC program is effectively implemented.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nIn accordance with RMP Section 68.77, the ESH Manager has responsibility for the overall pre-startup safety review program, which is closely tied to the MOC program.
