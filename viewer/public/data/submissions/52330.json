      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nLubrizol Advanced Materials, Inc. is a manufacturing company for surfactants in Bowling Green, Ohio.  James Hambrick is the CEO of Lubrizol and  is the Director of Operations.  Dennis Callan is plant manager of the Bowling Green plant. \n\nThe Bowling Green site consists of approximately 14 acres of land located at 1142 N Main Street in the city of Bowling Green, Wood County, Ohio.  The site is occupied by office and manufacturing facility under one roof, several smaller buildings which house equipment, and a warehouse building.  There are several outside storage tanks.  A water retention pond at the front of the property on Main Street contains storm water runoff.  Paved parking areas and drives serve the structures.  Surrounding land use is primarily commercial and industrial, with limited residential properties located directly on the south east border of the subject site.  \n\nLubrizol Advanced Materials, Inc. produces a variety of surfactants and related products, including organic sulfates, organic amides, and betaines.  Many of the products are blends of various surfactants and additives.  Byproducts include muriatic acid and methanol.  The products from Lubrizol are used in blends for commercial detergents, shampoos, and cosmetic products.  Products are shipped by tanker truck or by drum.  Most products are liquid with a very few being solid.  \n\nEpichlorohydrin will be stored inside the plant in the Hazardous Materials storage area, Building 5b.  This area is located in the main building housing the production and office areas of the facility.  The  Hazardous Materials storage area is equipped with a sprinkler system as is all of the building area within the main facility.  Primary containment systems within the interior of the building include a floor drain system.\n\nChemicals used in the plant are managed carefully by all personnel to avoid releases.  Both the production and maintenance teams consider process safety and personnel protection w"

Assistance in safety planning is available from the Lubrizol (Wickliffe, Ohio) corporate headquarters.  Hazardous operations review and planning is performed by a plant team consisting of plant management, EHS&S management, plant operations and maintenance personnel for chemicals of concern such as flammables, toxics or otherwise dangerous chemicals.    \n\nThe Plant Manager, Mr. Dennis Callan, is an active participant in local government organizations and industry associations dealing with safe chemical use, including the following member affiliations:\n\nWood County Local Emergency Planning Committee (voting member)  \nBowling Green Community Economic Development Foundation\nBowling Green Chamber of Commerce\nNorthwest Ohio Chemical and Allied Industries Group\n\nLubrizol personnel in leadership roles receive Technician-Level Emergency Response training designed to meet OSHA Hazard Communication Standard training requirements promulgated in 29 CFR 1910.120.  Personnel also receive Hazardous Materials training specific to the chemicals being stored and used on site. . \n\nSpill response equipment, including absorbents, protective equipment, and empty recovery/salvage drums, are stored in various areas of the plant.  Upon the receipt of EHS and selected hazardous materials in packages, emergency response equipment is relocated to the receiving area.  Additional spill response reclamation drums are stored in building 5a.  Materials Safety Data Sheets are located in the employee lunch room, filed in several ways for easy use and can also be found on the Lubrizol - Bowling Green Portal site.  A copy of the emergency response plan is also in this location and can also be found on the Lubrizol - Bowling Green Portal site.  Personal protective equipment (PPE) is assigned to each employee with additional PPE available in the lunchroom.\n\nThe process to manufa"

      "SummaryText": "cture sulfobetaine (Tradename Chembetaine CAS) is covered by Program Level 1 due to the raw material, epichlorohydrin, used in its manufacture.  Epichlorohydrin is stored in 55-gallon drums, four drums to a pallet stacked two high.  Warehousing quantities are not anticipated to exceed 40 drums, or 19,400 pounds at any given time. Product shipments are delivered in 40-unit lots.  A member of the plant management team, the Hazardous Materials Supervisor, oversees the receipt of epichlorohydrin as well as other hazardous materials.  The unloading area has containment and a trench drain large enough to capture the contents of at least one full drum. During unloading operations, the emergency spill mitigation cart is re-located to the receiving area.  An external drum sealing device is part of the contents of this cart.  \n\nThe worst case scenario was considered to be damage to a drum by a forklift resulting in the complete loss of the contents of the drum to the surroundings. If the event occurs in the truck unloading area, which is the most probable case, all the epichlorohydrin is contained within a trench designed to mitigate such a spill. The trench system was considered as passive mitigation in the modeling release scenario.  RMP*Comp was used to model this spill and predict the worst case offsite consequence.  In this case, there was no off-site consequence and the toxic endpoint limit of 76 mg/m3 epichlorohydrin was not reached on site.  No alternate scenario was considered.  \n\nThere is a plant emergency response plan.  The MSDS requirements are met, and the SARA 312 Tier II \"hazardous communications\" regulations are followed.  The plant also falls under the SARA 313 Toxic Release Inventory regulations.  The Storm Water Plan covers plant water discharge offsite to the Bowling Green stormwater collection system which eventually discharges to a local creek.  The facility has a general duty NPDES permit.  There are no other existing risk management covered chemicals "
