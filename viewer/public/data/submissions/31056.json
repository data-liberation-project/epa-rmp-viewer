The plant processes includes bulk storage of guar splits, alteration by chemical addition, and grinding.  Propylene oxide is stored in a bulk storage tank is delivered to the plant biweekly in tanker trucks.  The Risk Management Plan has been developed in accordance with \u00bfChemical Accident Prevention Provisions\u00bf under 40 CFR part 68.\nThe Aqualon facility uses Propylene Oxide above the threshold and is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Propylene Oxide is a listed regulated substance used in the P80 process and in the pilot plant.  RMP regulations define a Program 3 process to be one that has the potential for off-site impacts from a release and is subject to OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) program or is classified in one of nine Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.\n\nThe Offsite Consequences Analysis\n The population estimates are very conservative (the numbers are likely much higher than actually existed in the year 2000 \u00bf U.S. Census).  The Tiger/Line file was converted by the Office of the State Demographer into a \u00bfshape\u00bf file.  The \u00bfshape\u00bf file contains \u00bfblock\u00bf divisions for Karnes County, Texas for the U.S. Census Bureau 2000 data.  The block data file used in conjunction with the database file in ESRI ArcView 8.3 was used to determine the population density within each \u00bfblock\u00bf of interest.  The population density within each worst-case analysis area and the alternative case area was determined by intersecting the individual blocks within each circular area, using ArcView 8.3 Tools.  The population estimates are likely to be very conservative since the blocks do not share boundary with the circular areas of each scenario, but extend beyond in many instance and the population density within each block is assumed to be distributed uniformly throughout the block.  Consequently, where a block int"

As such, in many instances only a small portion of a block or partial block is contained within the circular area, so the estimates for these blocks are inflated.\n\n\n    \nThe Accidental Release and Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAqualon is dedicated to providing a safe and healthful environment for employees, customers, and communities.  Hercules\u00bf Aqualon facility is a OSHA VPP Star site.  This facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  All management practices associated with Responsible Care Program compliance are reviewed annually to assure all provisions are in place and operational.  Detailed emergency plans are in place at the plant.  They perform emergency drills regularly.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nPropylene oxide is handled in the bulk chemical storage and unloading area.  Typically, propylene oxide is delivered to the plant biweekly in tanker trucks with carry approximately 44,000 pounds each.  The truck is parked in the unloading area using procedures that assure the chemical holding portion of the truck is within the protected area.  The protected area has a trench around the perimeter, which is intended to catch any releases of propylene oxide.  The trench drains to a concrete lined neutralization pit where it can be pumped to another container or otherwise controlled.\n\nThe truck is hooked up to the unloading system using dry disconnect, 2-inch, stainless steel wire wrapped, flex hoses.  Dry disconnect hoses prevent release of chemical as the hoses are connected and disconnected.  Propylene oxide is pumped from the truck to the holding tank through stainless steel pipe.  All vapor associated with the unloading procedure is vented back to the truck with no release to the atmosphere.  The tank sits within a concrete containment dik"

Carriers have dedicated propylene oxide trailers that have manual shut off valves, excess flow valves, and hydraulic lines that can be tripped on the way out of the area to stop the flow.  \nAll operators are certified in the unloading operation and are required to stay within 25 feet of the truck while unloading is taking place.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe propylene oxide system complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable state codes and regulations.  The process equipment is designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards.  Automatic shut off valves and propylene oxide sensors have been installed since the last RMP submittal.\nThe unloading hoses are not pressurized, other than to equalize pressure between the tank and the truck during the unloading process.  Hoses are checked for leaks prior to unloading by visual inspection and pressure testing.  Certified operators are trained to use emergency hydraulic shut off system associated with dedicated propylene oxide trucks which would stop the discharge.  \n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental release events over the past five years involving propylene oxide that have had on-site or off-site impacts.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nAqualon communicates regularly with the community responders.  In the event of an emergency involving the propylene oxide system, it is our policy to notify the Sheriff\u00bfs Office and Karnes County Local Emergency Response Agency to request for assistance.  LEPC and the City of Kennedy Fire Department are notified through the Sheriff\u00bfs Office. Detailed emergency plans are in place at the plant.
