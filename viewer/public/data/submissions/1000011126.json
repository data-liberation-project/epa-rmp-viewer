This process is covered under the federal RMP Program I and CAPP tier B, program level I requirements, based on the storage of 15,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia with an ammonia concentration of 28 percent by weight. There have been no changes to the facility or regulated process since the date of the original RMP submittal that would affect the RMP program level for this facility. \n1.1\tAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response \nEDE has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and is committed to operating and maintaining all of the processes in a safe and responsible manner.  To help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment, EDE has implemented a combination of accident release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to employees, the public, and the environment.  EDE management is committed to providing appropriate training to employees and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers to ensure a safe operation. \n1.2\tStationary Source Description \nThere have been no significant changes to the facility since the original RMP was developed in 1999. The facility is an electric generating station consisting of one 175 megawatt (MW) steam turbine and two 165 MW combustion turbine generators capable of generating 490 MW of electricity.  The two 165 MW turbines burn pipeline quality sweet dry natural gas exclusively and are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems for the control of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. The SCRs employ ammonia injection technology that reduces NOx to the targeted level of 3.5 parts per million volume (ppmv) at 15 percent oxygen (O2). The ammonia source for the SCRs is aqueous ammonia with an ammonia concentration of 28 percent by weight.\n1.2"

Should an alarm be triggered, an operator will be sent to evaluate the situation and take the appropriate action of either shutting down the piece of equipment or initiating a clean up of discharged material.\n1.3.3\tAmmonia Loading/Unloading Procedures\nIn order to assist in the prevention of an accidental release of ammonia, EDE implements ammonia loading and unloading procedures.  The procedures are as follows:\n1.\tUpon arrival of the driver at the facility, he/she shall report to EDE\u00c2\u00bfs Control Room Operator (CRO) to confirm arrival of load and location of storage tank.\n2.\tDrive to loading/unloading area, stop the truck, set air brake, and shut off engine.

With the switch in the \u00c2\u00bfon\u00c2\u00bf position, the trailer\u00c2\u00bfs internal valve(s) will open and the trailer\u00c2\u00bfs air brakes will lock.  Chock wheels to prevent vehicle movement during product transfer.  The driver shall give EDE\u00c2\u00bfs receiving employee the Emergency Shut-Off Remote transmitter and assure that he/she has a full understanding of the Emergency Shut-Down Procedures.  Hold a safety briefing.\nSafety Note:  All of Air Gas\u00c2\u00bfs delivery vehicles have air-operated Emergency Shut-Off Valves with multiple Shut-Off Switch locations.  All delivery vehicles are also equipped with hand-held remote transmitters that are capable of completely shutting down the off-loading procedure from a distance of up to 300 feet.\n3.\tThe driver shall park the truck on the pavement (a solid, level surface), directly to the West of the ammonia storage tank.  This positioning will allow for unrestricted access to the receiving storage tank filling connections.  This position will also allow for a connection of the liquid and vapor delivery hoses to the storage tank filling connections without straining the hose by stretching or excessive ben"

      "SummaryText": ".1\tRegulated Substances Handled\nThere have been no significant changes to the ammonia storage and handling system since the development of the original RMP. \nThe ammonia storage and handling system at the facility is comprised of a single storage tank, pumps, piping, and a vaporizer. Following the vaporizer, there are two blowers (for each SCR) that deliver the vaporized ammonia stream to the SCRs. \nThe tank is a horizontally-oriented cylindrical tank, rounded on each end. The tank is constructed of carbon steel which is compatible with aqueous ammonia. The tank has a total capacity of 16,400 gallons and is equipped with pressure relief valves, a flame arrestor, and temperature, pressure and level indicators. The maximum capacity of the tank is administratively limited to 15,000 gallons. \nThe tank is installed within a concrete secondary containment structure. The containment structure has a surface area of 1,123.5 square feet (53.5 feet by 21 feet) and a wall height of 3.5 feet. The total containment capacity is 29,415 gallons. \nThe piping from the tank to the vaporizer is also carbon steel, 1 to 2 inches in diameter, depending on the service. \n1.3\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\nThe facility has onsite spill prevention and control procedures, including daily visual inspections and planned maintenance activities, which help to reduce the potential for hazardous material releases to the soil or surface waters. The following sections provide a summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n1.3.1\tDischarge Detection by Personnel\nThe facility operators perform a visual inspection of the facility during each shift. During the inspection, deficiencies are noted on a checklist and corrections are initiated either immediately or a work request is generated depending on the nature of the problem. Records of the inspection checklist are kept in the Control Building.\n1.3.2\tAmmonia Automatic Detection \nAutomatic ammonia vapor level sens"

EDE has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) Update for the facility in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 Section 190 (\u00c2\u00a768.190).  In accordance with \u00c2\u00a768.190(b)(1), this update has been prepared within 5 years from the date of the most recent update, which occurred in September 2004. The plan was originally submitted to the Administering Agency, the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) in September 1999.\nThe federal RMP regulations require periodic updating of the RMP program information, but do not require that the entire plan be recreated in its entirety. In fact, the RMP regulations require that many of the program documents be retained for the life of the plan. The RMP is expected to change and evolve as the facility changes, as new information on chemical hazards is developed, as the affected system is modified, and as the surrounding community changes. In some instances, new program elements supersede previous versions; in other cases, the new program element supplements the previous version. To ease the administrative burden for the facility, the previous version of the RMP is incorporated by reference into this RMP update. \nPursuant to the regulations outlined in the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 459.9542, the Clean Air Act Section 112(r), and 40 CFR 68, this RMP has been prepared and submitted by El Dorado Energy, L.L.C. This program is implemented under the Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) of the Bureau of Waste Management (BWM) NDEP.\nThe scope of the RMP is based on discussion with NDEP and the Boulder City Fire Department to ensure that all issues are resolved and to incorporate state requirements.
