      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Kinder Morgan facility located in Geismar, Louisiana, referred herein as Kinder Morgan Geismar Logistics Terminal (GLT), handles Toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate in their drumming operation.  This is a toxic liquid, therefore it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent human exposure and minimize health impacts to our employees and the surrounding community.   \n\n\n\nKinder Morgan GLT is subject to Risk Management Planning (RMP) regulations, which are governed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  This regulation  requires facilities that store listed toxic or flammable substances in excess of the listed threshold limit, as defined in 40 CFR 68.130, to develop and submit a formal risk management plan to the USEPA, as well as state and local agencies to evaluate the potential impacts of an accidental chemical release.  The RMP rule is divided into three programs, based on off-site chemical impacts on neighboring schools, residential areas, and other structures of public occupation.  Program 1 is defined as a process or processes with no public receptors within the distance to an endpoint from a worst-case release and with no accidents with specific off-site consequences within the past five (5) years.  Program 2 is defined as processes that are not eligible for Program 1 or subject to Program 3.  Program 2 imposes a streamlined prevention program, but includes additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements.  Program 3 is defined by processes that are not eligible for either Program 1 or 2 and are subject to OSHA's PSM standard, state OSHA programs, or classified in one of ten NAICS codes placed in Program 3.  \n\n\n\nKinder Morgan GLT is regulated under Program 1 rule requirements as stated in 68.12(b) because:\n\n\n\n- It maintains storage inventories of toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate, a listed toxic liquid at above-ambient conditions, in excess of 10,000 lbs as defined by 40 CFR P"

      "SummaryText": "art 68 Subpart G.\n\n- The distance to an endpoint for a worst-case release from Kinder Morgan GLT into a drain/sump area, calculated to be approximately 0.046 mile, does not impact off-site public receptors. \n\n- There have been no accidents or accidents that would result in a release event in the past five (5) years.  \n\n- It does not operate under an NAICS code specified for the Program 3 rule.\n\n\n\nThe June 2017 resubmission is a voluntary submission to update various information including the last safety inspection by an external agency, the date of the most recent emergency response plan update for the facility and the date of the most recent emergency response training for facility employees.  The total inventory of the covered chemical has also been updated to reflect drum storage quantities in addition to the volume of the product storage tank.  The worst-case scenario release quantity is unchanged.  \n\n"
