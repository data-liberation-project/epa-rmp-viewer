The tanks will probably be stored at this location from October 1 to November 30 and March 1 to April 30 of any given year depending upon weather conditions.\n\n1. Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Gold Eagle cooperative, Livermore, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: Anhydrous ammonia may be stored in 12 nurse tanks of 1,000 gallons each for retail sale to local famers or for custom application by the Cooperative. The maximum amount stored would be 52,020 pounfds.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios: A) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank. This would be 4,300 pounds to a distance of 0.4 miles to the endpoint of dispersion of 200 parts per million (ppm). B) The Alternate Case Scenario would be a release from a transfer hose failure. This would be 4,300 pounds to a distance of 0.2 miles to the endpoint of 200 ppm.\n\n4. Accidental Release prevention: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from these tanks in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: The facility has: a) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and b) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planni"
