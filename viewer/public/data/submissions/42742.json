Management systems have been developed, and are continually improved, to prevent the release of regulated substances, especially in locations which may have a detrimental impact on employees, the community, or the environment.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION, REGULATED SUBSTANCES/PROCESSES\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Fort James Camas Mill is a 661 acre pulp and paper manufacturing complex established in 1883 as the Columbia River Paper Company.  It began as a pioneer newsprint mill and has evolved into a 1200 ton/day integrated facility.  Current products include communication papers, market pulp, toweling, and tissue.  The mill site is bounded on three sides by the City of Camas.  Approximately 185 acres of the mill site lie north of the Camas Slough (an arm of the Columbia River) and are heavily developed.  Lady Island is situated directly south of the slough and covers some 476 acres. It hosts the wastewater treatment system and several solid waste handling facilities.  It is also a wildlife preservation area.  The mill employs approximately a thousand people from communites in Southwest Washington and Northwest Oregon.  Pulp and paper manufacturing processes operate around the clock, seven days per week, and throughout the year.  Production equipment is periodically shut down for scheduled maintenance and curtailed based on market demand.  The entire facility is shut down periodically for large scale utility maintenance and cleaning.\n\nRegulated Substances/Processes\n\nThe Camas Mill uses a variety of materials to brighten pulp and paper products including oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and chlorine dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is a regulated substance.  It is manufactured in the R-8 Chlorine Dioxide Generator.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e chemical is produced as a 0.9% solution but for the purposes of this report, we have assumed that the concentration is 1.4%.  This the maximum possible concentration in our system.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Camas Mill Accidental Release Prevention Program has been developed to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, as administered by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and WAC 296-67, Safety Standards For Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, as administered by the Washington Department of Labor & Industries.  The Process Safety Management Program, or PSM, is comprised of fourteen different elements, each of which contributes to the health and safety of workers whose jobs place them in contact with hazardous chemicals.  The mill has two qualified PSM coordinators managing the program.  In addition, to this resource, the mill maintains a PSM Steering Committee that meets regularly to oversee, audit, and implement all aspects of the PSM program.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years we have experienced one accidental release of chlorine dioxide and one accidental release of both chlorine and chlorine dioxide.  The largest of these released 197 pounds of chlorine dioxide and 27 pounds of chlorine.  Neither incident created an off site impact (evacuations, injuries, property damage, etc).\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Camas Mill maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program, which is intended to protect employees, the community, and the environment.  The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, either accident or natural, that could result in a release of regulated materials.  Procedures have also been developed for addressing potential fire or explosion situations involving flammable substances.  The Camas Mill employs a full time emergency response team, which is fully qualified to respond "

Training and drills are conducted annually to ensure our ability to respond to spill events.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2003 the Camas Mill completed its community warning system, a one million dollar project developed with Camas Fire and Police Departments.  The mill installed two electronic sirens - one located at each end of the mill property - which can broadcast a 360 degree warning to a distance of at least one mile from the mill (and downtown Camas).  These sirens are available to alert the community to an emergency that may require people to evacuate or stay inside (shelter in place) until an all clear is given.  Examples of such emergencies are earthquakes, severe weather, train derailments, and hazardous chemical spills and releases."
