Daily and weekly inspections of equipment with immediate repairs of found problems.  Each employee is trained and must demonstrate both a cognitive and hands-on understanding of the chlorine process before allowed to operate as an individual.  Chlorine training occurs each year with a review of the Emergency Action Plan.  There are local alarms and indicators to a faulty system which are monitored 24 hours a day.  Management is keenly aware of the need to monitor the system and demands compliance from all employees in this matter.\n\nThere has been no releases in the past five years\n \nKokomo Wastewater Facility  has an Emergency Response Plan which has been reviewed with the local Fire Department and the Howard County LEPC.  The last visit by the Fire Department was in July of 2021.  Additionally, one is planned for the summer of 2023 in the month of July.\n\n \n\nThe implemented Prevention Programs are as follows:\n\n     Emergency Action Plan\n     Process Safety Management which includes:\n     Process Hazard Analysis\n              Management of Change\n              Pre-start up review\n              Contractor safety      \n     Operating procedures\n     Training\n     Incident/accident Investigation\n     Compliance auditing\n     Employee participation\n     Hot work permit program"

      "SummaryText": "The City of Kokomo Wastewater Treatment is owned by the city of Kokomo.  It is managed by a Superintendent appointed by the Mayor.  There is an Asst. Superintendent. Both the Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent oversee the day to day operations.\n\nFacility policies prohibit untrained persons from operating the chlorine system or changing tanks.  If an incident should occur, it is investigated with diligence and responsible parties are held accountable.  Every employee has safety training annually, regardless of shift.  New employees receive handling and operational training. This training is documented and on file.  The vendor of the chlorine provides annual updates on chlorine safety.  Critical components of the system are replaced annually to insure accuracy and that the possibility of failure is kept to a minimum.\n\nThe stationary source is within the building designed for the chlorine system.  Inside, there are four-one ton cylinders attached to a feed line system, each with its own regulator and line.  The feed required for proper bacteria control requires all tanks to be on line.  This area is enclosed with an alarm and monitoring system.  Procedures are posted in this location for easy reference.  There are always a minimum of three employees present when tank work is being completed.\n\n\nWorst case scenario is offloading a one ton cylinder and causing a crack or rupture.  Total release would be 2000 pounds of Chlorine.  RMP Comp was used with a release time of 10 minutes at a  rate of 110 pounds per minute.  Wind speed 1.5 m/sec.  Toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles.   \n\nAlternative release scenario is a leak in the hose (line) system.  This would be identified by alarm system and the process shut down without delay.  Employees are trained to respond and repair the leak or call outside repair service if it is outside of their abilities.  RMP Comp was used to determine endpoint of 0.10 miles, effectively staying on the facility property.  Maximum release of 535 p"
