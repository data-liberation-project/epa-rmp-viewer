This update is prepared to comply with the requirements of EPA 40 CFR 68 for Risk Management Programs. \n\nIn addition, this re-submittal incorporates the inclusion of the LPG Rail Car Temporary Storage and Loading Area as separate processes, as recommended based on the EPA PSM/RMP audit of April 2009.  Although previously included as part of an existing process, covered under all required elements of PSM and RMP, the change identifies each one as a separate covered process.\n\nNormal butane, stored within the railcars are temporarily stored in the LPG Rail Car Temporary Storage area.  Normal butane is used to meet winter gasoline blending requirements.  Thus, the number of rail cars on site varies seasonally (i.e. more rail cars primarily in the winter months only).  Therefore, this RMP filing will be predictive for the LPG Rail Car Temporary Storage and Loading Area.\n\nThe refinery is required to meet the requirements Program Level 3 for this regulation because the covered processes in the refinery\n\na) Do not meet the eligibility requirements for Program Level 1 as defined,\nb) Have a NAICS which is listed for Program Level 3, and \nc) Are subject to the OSHA PSM standard in 29CFR1910.119.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe  Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company, has a long-standing commitment to worker, public, and environmental safety.  Resources invested in accident prevention, such as the training of personnel and the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes, demonstrate this commitment.

However, should a release occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release to the greatest extent possible.\n\nThe LAR process units and physical systems including the tank farm are divided into two areas, referred to as refining processes and utility systems.  The overall responsibility of the day-to-day operation of each area is assigned to an individual, known as the Area Business Manager (ABM).  In addition to these areas, there are several technical departments at LAR.  The overall RMP Program responsibility resides with the LAR Refinery Manager.  The specific responsibility for the development and implementation of each RMP element is with the various production and technical department managers. The refinery has also designated the \"PSM/RMP Coordinator\" as the qualified person, who is responsible for coordinating the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program activities.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REFINERY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery is located in an area that is zoned for heavy industrial use.  The 299-acre refinery is divided by Pacific Coast Highway with most of the facility located to the north of the highway.  Sepulveda Boulevard and the Kinder Morgan Energy Company bound the northern portion of the refinery with Alameda Street and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks to the west and the Dominguez Channel to the east.  The area south of Pacific Coast Highway is a triangle-shaped parcel that approaches Anaheim Boulevard to the south and is bounded by Dominguez Channel to the east, and by the Tesoro Marketing Sales Terminal to the west.\n\nThe refinery processes approximately 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day, through a variety of operations, including hydrocracking, hydrotreating, fluid catalytic cracking, delayed coking, and alkylation."

Special groups, committees and individuals have been identified as having PSM responsibilities at the refinery. Nevertheless, all employees are encouraged to raise specific suggestions or concerns related to process safety management by contacting their immediate supervisor or the PSM coordinator.  The LAR Employee Participation Program is described in Standing Instruction PSM-1.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAt the LAR, we have compiled process safety information for all processes containing hazardous or regulated materials as required by state and federal regulations, such as PSM, RMP, and CalARP.  This information has to do with process chemicals, technology, and equipment used in the handling, storage, and processing of regulated hazardous substances. Additionally, this compiled process safety information is used in the LAR PSM program as a resource for the teams performing process hazard analyses.  The information can also be helpful for the trainers who develop the training programs and the operating procedures, for the contractors whose employees will be working with the refinery processes, and for emergency responders in preparing for response should a release occur.  Standing Instruction PSM-2 that describes the Management of Change procedure also contains a roadmap to assist the user in finding the process safety information.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA primary element of the LAR Prevention Program is the Process Hazard Analysis, or PHA.

Through this process, information is obtained that will help improve process safety and system reliability, as well as reducing the potential consequences of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Because of the size and complexity of many of the refinery processes, the HAZOP methodology has been selected as the most appropriate PHA method in conducting the PHA for each process.  A HAZOP team at LAR typically consists of a process engineer, an experienced operator, an instrument & electrical engineer/technician, a mechanical engineer, and other part-time team members.  The team leader (a.k.a. the HAZOP facilitator) is fully knowledgeable in the proper implementation of the HAZOP methodology.  Part-time team members typically provide specialized expertise in areas such as safety and health, and equipment inspection/metallurgy/corrosion.  Standing Instruction PSM-3 summarizes the LAR procedure for conducting PHAs.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe LAR provides written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: process startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  The operating procedures describe tasks to be performed, data to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The LAR takes steps to update the procedures to reflect current operations and the procedures are certified annually by the operating staff.  In addition, operating procedures are updated when there are any changes in the process as a result of the management of change procedures.  \n\nTraining\nAnother primary element of the LAR Prevention Program is Training.  The training program consists of both job skill (qualification) and safety training.

The LAR provides initial training to new hires and regular refresher training to the refinery employees.  The job skill training is presented in various forms and degrees and is dependent on the skills required for the employee's job or position.  The purpose of this training is to elevate the aptitude and knowledge of the operation personnel of the process control and technology used and the equipment operated in the refinery.  All employees, including maintenance and contractor employees, involved with highly hazardous chemicals and regulated substances are provided with safety training.  The goal of the safety training is to provide information to the workers so they will understand the recognized hazards of the processes and chemicals that they work with and around.   \n\nContractors\nThe Los Angeles Refinery has established the Contractor Safety Program (Standing Instruction SAF-30) as a screening process that helps identify and select contractors who will perform work in and around processes that involve hazardous chemicals.  Such contractors must have the appropriate skills, knowledge, and certifications for the job tasks which they are being employed.  For contractors whose safety performance on the job is not known, the LAR obtains information on injury and illness rates and references regarding the contractor.  An evaluation is also conducted of contractor work methods and experiences.  Thus, contractors without safety programs or with unacceptable safety records will not be invited to perform works at the LAR.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe LAR has implemented a Management of Change (MOC) procedure (Standing Instruction PSM-2) to manage changes to the refinery units.  Changes are defined as modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials, or processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\".  \nPSM-2 includes modifications in the operating procedures that contain operatin"

The Management of Change procedure also covers changes in process technology, changes to equipment and instrumentation, and changes to safety sensitive organizational changes.  Changes in process technology can result from changes in production rates, raw materials, experimentation, equipment unavailability, new equipment, new product development, change in catalyst and changes in operating conditions to improve yield or quality.  Equipment changes include, among others, change in materials of construction, equipment specifications, capacity, piping pre-arrangements, experimental equipment, computer program revisions, and changes in alarms and interlocks.  \nTemporary changes are also subject to the management of change provisions in PSM-2 and the procedure also insures that the equipment and operating procedures are returned to their original or designed conditions at the end of the temporary change.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\nA pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is carried out in conjunction with an MOC or a new project or construction (Standing Instructions PSM-5).  The PSSR is conducted before implementing a modification to a process, or commissioning a new project.  \nAs it is LAR practice to conduct a PHA for various types of changes and for all new projects, there could be some recommendations resulting from the PHA that are required to be addressed before implementation.  A PSSR is carried out in the form of a checklist to comply with requirements of the applicable regulations.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nA mechanical integrity program is in place for the continued integrity of process equipment at LAR.  Equipment used to process, transfer or store hazardous chemicals have been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.

Elements of the mechanical integrity program are as follows: (1) categorization of equipment and instrumentation, (2) inspection and testing program, (3) maintenance program, (4) documentation, and (5) quality assurance program.\n\nHot Work Permit\nAll non-routine work, and some routine work that are conducted in process areas at the refinery are controlled using specific company instructions, described in Standing Instruction SAF-003 (Work Permits). This specific company instruction includes Safe Work, Hot Work and Confined Space Entry.  The Hot Work Permit is discussed below.  \n\nA hot work permit describes the steps that operating, maintenance and contractor personnel must follow to obtain the necessary clearance to perform different types of work involving hot surfaces, flame, or energized equipment.  The hazards identified for the work being performed are communicated to those personnel performing the work, and also to those personnel who may be affected by the work being performed, especially when the work being performed could affect the safety of the process.  The hot work permit procedures refer to and coordinate the following procedures and authorizations, as applicable: lockout/tagout, line breaking, and confined space entry.\n\nIncident Investigation\nStanding Instruction SAF-11 outlines the LAR incident investigation procedure.  It applies to the investigation of different types of incidents that may occur in the facility.

Team members are selected on the basis of their training, knowledge, and ability to contribute to a team effort to investigate the incident and usually include an operator from the area where the incident occurred.  The operator\u00c2\u00bfs knowledge of the events can help to identify and verify relevant facts about the incident.  It is the goal of the investigation to treat all involved individuals in a fair, open and consistent manner.  The incident report, its findings and recommendations are entered in the incident investigation tracking system, which can be accessed by all employees, and also distributed to others who can benefit from the information.\n\nCompliance Audits\nIn compliance with corporate policies, the refinery has implemented a Compliance Assurance Program.  The program helps to verify that LAR's programs and practices comply with applicable laws and regulations. Every three years, the refinery undergoes an PSM/RMP Compliance Audits conducted by company staff.  The audit approach includes the following steps: (1) pre-audit preparation, (2) on-site field review, and (3) post-audit follow-up.  The audit team is composed of qualified staff from whom a leader will be assigned to be responsible for these steps.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe accident prevention programs summarized previously apply to all the covered processes and their related hazards.  These programs help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.  In addition to the accident prevention program activities, LAR has safety features on many units to help contain or control potential releases, quickly detect a release, and reduce (mitigate) the potential consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes.\n\n- Release Detection\n     - Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n     - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detectors with alarms\n\n- Release Containment and Control\n     - P"

The ERP has included a set of potential incidents that are used for emergency drills, including accidental release of toxic gases (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide), accidental release of flammable materials resulting in a fire and explosion, and accidental spill of hazardous materials on the ground within the refinery perimeter.  \n\nLAR uses an Emergency Management Organization, known as Incident Command System (ICS), to respond and manage incidents.  The ICS has a hierarchical (chain of command) structure, which places the highest responsibility on the Emergency Manager, who has the overall responsibility for the emergency.  The Emergency Manager delegates direct command responsibilities to the Incident Commander, who has the highest authority during an emergency.  The Emerge"

      "SummaryText": "ncy Manger is a liaison between the Incident Commander, the public, and the Company.  The next level of responsibility resides on four section chiefs: Command Chief, Operations Chief, Planning Chief, and Logistics/Finance Chief.  All section chiefs receive directions from the Incident Commander during an emergency.  Each position in the organization has specific assignments and responsibilities, which are defined in the ERP.  The ICS is expanded or contracted to meet the needs or requirements of an emergency.  As the scope and complexity of an emergency expands so does the Incident Command System.\n\nThe refinery has a three-tier emergency activation system in place.  A Level 1 emergency is defined as an event, which can occur at a local work area (e.g., a unit), with minor consequences to health or property, which would not have an impact on the other units in the refinery.  A Level 1 emergency is handled by the personnel available on the unit and does not require assistance from personnel outside of the work area.  A Level 2 emergency is a refinery emergency that would not require assistance from responders outside of LAR, but would require additional resources from the LAR Fire Brigade.  The highest level of an emergency is Level 3, which is defined as an emergency of a size and scope that would require outside resources.  A Level 3 emergency is triggered when life and property are endangered or when the emergency could result or has resulted in offsite consequences. \n\nLAR maintains an industrial fire brigade, which consists of three emergency response (ER) teams, specialized in rescue, hazardous materials, and spill containment.  Each ER team is lead by a captain and consists of six to nine members.  External sources provide assistance in the form of alerting the public, evacuation, transportation, and providing hazard mitigation equipment, supplies, and personnel to complement LAR capabilities. It should be emphasized that external assistance is requested only du"

In addition to these sources, LAR has coordinated with the local hospitals, clinics, and doctors about the properties of the various types of hazardous materials processed and handled at the refinery.  All ER team members, ER team captains, and area safety coordinators are required to attend quarterly onsite training.  Outside training is also provided annually to various ERT members, shift supervisors, and area safety coordinators.  Emergency training is provided annually to the emergency response team.  ICS role-play is provided to refinery personnel as part of the emergency drill held on a monthly basis.\n\nCOMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the RMP Rule, Los Angeles Refinery, in a joint effort with other local RMP-covered industry companies in Southern California, has made strides to establish a sound communication link with the communities surrounding the industrial facilities.  The primary objectives of this endeavor have been to: (a) share with the public our knowledge about the operations and activities, as well as the hazards of our facilities, (b) learn from the public their interests and concerns, and (c) establish an on-going relationship with the community regarding potential risks of the facilities.  \n\nSince the initial presentations and discussions regarding the RMP rule, the LAR has maintained an open line of communication with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) for the refinery.  The LEPC is kept informed of significant changes to the refinery operations relevant to their jurisdiction.  If after being informed of a proposed or implemented change, the LEPC suggests that further public discussions were warranted, LAR management would take the appropriate steps to provide the required information for communication about the changes to the RMP information to community groups.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nLAR has several Process Safety Initiative teams that continually"
