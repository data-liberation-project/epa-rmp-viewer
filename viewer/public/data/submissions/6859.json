In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.\n\nThese programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels that are interconnected and separate vessels, which are located, such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nJ.R. Simplot Company operates a potato products manufacturing facility in Heyburn, Idaho.  The only chemical found to be present above its respective RM program quantity threshold at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  There is a single Program Level 3 ammonia refrigeration process.

The RM Program Manager has the overall RM Program responsibility, and has the authority to assign company resources to develop, implement, update, and integrate all applicable RM program elements at the Heyburn facility. The RMP/PSM Team Leader is assigned by the RM Program Manager to ensure that the RM Program is developed, implemented, and updated in compliance with the RM Program regulations. The Manager of Environment, Health and Safety is the designated RMP/PSM Team Leader, and has the day-to-day responsibility for the RM Program. The RMP/PSM Team Leader is supported by the RMP/PSM Team, which includes the Maintenance Manager, Plant Engineer, Refrigeration Lead and Refrigeration Operators.  Individuals have been assigned responsibility for all five elements of the RM program, including management, prevention, hazard assessment, emergency response, and RM plan updates.  In addition, the RMP/PSM team is responsible to communicate the requirements of the RM Program to the members of the emergency response team (ERT), who have been trained to provide the initial site response/incident command for hazardous material releases, fires or explosions. \n\nThe RMP/PSM Team Leader reports to the RM Program Manager and receives direction and support from the Vice President of Environment and Regulatory Affairs and the Division Safety Manager.

The prevention program for the ammonia process was developed to comply with PSM regulations, and was most recently updated in the second quarter of 1999.  Updating the PSM program is a continuous process and several of the PSM program element guidelines and procedures are currently being updated, and will be completed shortly after the RMP submittal due date.  Key provisions of the facility release prevention program are as follows:\n\n7 Employees who operate these systems must receive training initially and periodically on safe startup/shutdown, operations, and emergency shutdown of the processes.  \n7 Release incidents are investigated, and the results are used to improve the safety of the process. \n7 The ammonia refrigeration system is maintained through the mechanical integrity program, which minimizes the risk of accident and maximizes process safety. \n7 Results of incident investigations are also shared with employees who could be affected by the process.  \n7 Employees participate in a process hazard analysis (PHA) which identifies potential hazards and ways to improve the safety of the process every five years, or whenever significant changes are made to the process.\n7 The facility has a management of change (MOC) program in place that mandates that changes to the ammonia system are reviewed prior to implementing the change to ensure that the change would not compromise safety.\n7 A pre-startup review is also completed after a major change and prior to a new process coming on line.  \n7 A hot work (spark producing) permit program is in place. \n7 Contractors who are hired to work on or near the regulated processes must have adequate training on the hazards prior to starting work.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\nOffsite consequence analyses need to consider the release history of each process.

Modeling procedures followed EPA guidance to identify worst case release scenarios (WCS) and alternate case release scenarios (ACS) as defined by the RM Program regulations.  EPA personnel freely admit that the assumptions used for WCS are not realistic and in some cases are not physically possible.  However, EPA guidance was followed and toxic endpoints were identified for the WCS and the ACS.  ACSs are considered by EPA to be more realistic and useful for emergency response planning than the WCS.\n\nFollowing EPA guidance the largest vessel approach, considering potential passive mitigation, was used to estimate the WCS.  The WCS for the facility was identified by assuming that the contents of the largest vessel are released in a 10-minute period. The largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system is the #6 intercooler located in the ammonia compressor room.  This vessel contains a maximum of 7,800 pounds of ammonia liquefied under pressure.  The intercooler is located inside of a building; therefore, passive mitigation has been assumed.  Under worst case weather conditions, the modeled WCS release would result in an endpoint radius of 1.2 miles.  The estimated affected residential population within the 1.2 mile WCS radius is 1,200 persons.  This estimate does not include non-residential persons that could be located within the endpoint radius (i.e. workers, etc.).\n\nACSs were evaluated following EPA and IIAR guidelines.  The ACS that resulted in the longest distance to the endpoint was selected for presentation in this document and for reporting to E"

The estimated release of liquid ammonia is 250 pounds per minute for a maximum of 10 minutes (2,500 pounds total - it is assumed that an operator could respond within 10 minutes to stop the release).  Under common weather conditions, the calculated release rate to the environment from this accident scenario results in an endpoint radius of 0.3 miles.  The estimated affected population within the 0.3 mile ACS radius is 49 persons.  This estimate does not non-residential persons that could be located within the endpoint radius (i.e. workers, etc.).  Although this accident scenario was selected as the ACS, the likelihood of its occurrence is minimal because of the process safety programs that have been instituted at the facility. \n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility.  Additionally, we have an Emergency Response Team (ERT) that is trained to respond to ammonia releases and other emergency situations (i.e. fires, SPCC oil spill response, other chemical releases, etc.). \n\nRM Program Reporting:\nThe timely submittal of the RMP*Submit program meets the RM program reporting requirements.  The J.R. Simplot Heyburn facility will update this submittal every five years, or sooner if necessary, based on RM program regulation requirements or process modifications."
