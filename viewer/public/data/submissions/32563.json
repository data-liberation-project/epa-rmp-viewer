The Tahlequah facility has experienced zero (0) chlorine releases in the past five years. \n\nThe Tahlequah Pumping and Water Treatment facility is attended at all times with trained operators, including personnel who are recognized as Certified Water Works Operators by the Oklahoma State Department of Health. To help ensure the safety of chlorine operations, the facility maintains the following information and programs: chlorine safety information, hazard reviews, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, training, and compliance audits.\n\nThe Tahlequah Pumping and Water Treatment facility is commited to continually improving the safety of its operations. Recent improvements have included the addition of a chlorine leak detector system, partial enclosure for chlorine cylinders, and other safeguards to improve the safety and security of chlorine operations. \n\nThe facility maintains an emergency action plan that includes instructions for immediately requesting assistance from the City of Tahlequah Fire Department in the event of an emergency release of chlorine and for making appropriate notifications to public agencies. Information has been provided to the Cherokee County LEPC for coordinating the facility's plans with the community emergency response plans.
