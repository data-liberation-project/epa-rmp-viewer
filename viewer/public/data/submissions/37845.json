This commitment is inherent in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of processes involving regulated substances. Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant has coordinated with local and other emergency response organizations which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances \nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic consumer products such as polystyrene foam plates, bowls, food containers, and trays that you might find meat or poultry on in a supermarket.  We have one substance present at our facility that is regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program, in excess of the 10,000-pound reporting threshold.  This substance is referenced in this document by the term \u00bfregulated substance\u00bf.  The regulated substance at our facility is used as foaming agents in the production of the polystyrene foam.  These products are also often called \u00bfblowing agents\u00bf or \u00bfexpansion agents\u00bf.\n\nWritten operating procedures and high-level alarms prevent more than the maximum inventory amount from being present at this facility.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  We also have an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act.  This facility has received a Star Ranking under OSHA\u00bfs Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) for over fifteen (15) years.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPactiv Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating guidelines and equipment designs associated with the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts extensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The approach used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP/Modified What-If process.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations, and safety and are revalidated at a regular interval of approximately every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Pactiv Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nPactiv Corporation utilizes a detailed training program to ensure that employees who are operating processes using regulated substances are skilled in the handling, oper"

Refresher training is provided at least every one (1) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPactiv Corporation carries out routine, periodic maintenance inspections and conducts preventive maintenance on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined during these inspections include, but are not limited to: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel  trained in maintenance practices.  These personnel are provided specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures at Pactiv Corporation are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes and provided training, as needed, to deal with these changes.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Pactiv Corporation.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that equipment and procedures are complete and suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPactiv Corporation conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the requirements set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPactiv Corporation promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophi"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Many employees participate in safety initiatives within the plant.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor\u00bfs safety performance and program is carried out.  Pactiv Corporation has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00bfs work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nHot Work \nThe facility maintains a hot work program and issues a hot work permit for hot work conducted on or near the covered process.  Hot work is performed by qualified personnel who complete each permit and fulfill its requirements prior to the start of a hot work operation.  These permits are kept on file until the conclusion of the hot work operation.\n\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\nPactiv Corporation has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.

In addition, emergency response equipment (fire extinguishers, etc) is regularly inspected and serviced.\n\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nOur facility has been certified for over ten years by OSHA as a STAR site in their Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).  To achieve this status, our facility has excellent occupational safety and health programs that encompass employee involvement, recognition for safe work, partnership with OSHA and continuous hazard identification activities.\n\nTo enhance our continuous improvement in occupational safety and health, we conduct monthly general safety and annual VPP safety planning meetings, which includes employee participation."
