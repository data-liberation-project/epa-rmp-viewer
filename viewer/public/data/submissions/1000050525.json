At the Washington Works facility in West Virginia where both entities reside, Chemours is now the property owner and DuPont is a tenant.\r\n\r\nThe Chemours Company is a member of the American Chemistry Council and receives external certification of its Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) consistent with those requirements. The Chemours Washington Works site adheres to Corporate Environmental, Health & Safety policies which are a part of that program.  For safety and environmental incidents, these policies can be summarized as follows:\r\n  -We believe all safety and environmental incidents are preventable.\r\n  -Our goal for incidents is zero.\r\n  -We are prepared for emergencies and we will provide leadership for our local communities to \r\n    help in their emergency preparedness.\r\n\r\nCorporate Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) & RCMS policies are embodied in numerous site procedures along with guidelines and recommended practices in Chemours Engineering Standards. Corporate EHS policies and Washington Works EHS procedures are available for review by all employees.\r\n\r\nAt Washington Works, EHS policies and procedures are also documented in the Washington Works EHS Manual.  Various procedures throughout the manual deal specifically with Process Safety Management elements to prevent incidents from occurring.  It is the responsibility of every employee and contractor working on our behalf to comply with these procedures.  It is management's responsibility to educate and train employees so they may understand and comply with the procedures. \r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\nThe Chemours Washington Works main plant site consists of approximately 450 acres located approximately five miles west of Parkersburg, WV.  Manufacturing operations are located on approximately 170 of the 450 acres.  Polymer resins and pr"

This standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  The standard involves the following activities as listed below: \r\n\r\nSafety in Design\r\n- A documented process technology system covers hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and process design basis.\r\n- Extensive active and passive preventative and mitigating systems are strategically located.\r\n- Applicable codes and standards are met or exceeded.\r\n- Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity.\r\n- Quality Assurance ensures fabrication in accordance with design specifications and proper assembly.\r\n\r\nSafety in Maintenance\r\n- Maintenance personnel are trained and experienced.\r\n- Contractors are trained and qualified.\r\n- A work permit system controls hazards.\r\n\r\nSafety in Operations\r\n- Operators are trained and job qualified.\r\n- Technical resources are available and utilized as required.\r\n- Operators follow approved procedures.\r\n\r\nSafety through Reviews, Inspections, Process Hazards Analysis, Investigation and Auditing\r\n- Routine safety inspections are conducted.\r\n- Corporate and independent audits and reviews are conducted.\r\n- Process Hazards Analyses are conducted.\r\n- Safety critical equipment is set up on a periodic inspection frequency to ensur"
