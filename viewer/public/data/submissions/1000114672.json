Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes at the Upper Stone Canyon Station to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.\n      The LADWP Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station (USCCS) chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and Plan requirements. The chlorination facility is also subject to the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.

All applicable requirements of the State of California and the EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n      The LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements. The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency. The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department). \nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n      The Upper Stone Canyon Station is located at 1900 North Stone Canyon Road in Los Angeles, California. There are multiple chlorine feed points on the reservoir complex property to disinfect water in Upper and Lower Stone Canyon Reservoirs, the Upper Stone Canyon bypass pipelines #1 and #2, and the membrane filtration plant. The treated water is piped into the distribution network, which serves parts of west Los Angeles with potable water.\n      The chlorination station building consists of a chlorine storage room, chlorine equipment room, an electrical equipment room, several chemical storage rooms, and a 4,700-lb capacity dry media scrubber room. The chlorination station uses ton containers for storing chlorine. A maximum of 22 ton containers c"

There is an automatic switchover system that determines which liquid chlorine header feeds the evaporators. This system consists of a control panel, two motorized ball valves, and a pressure switch on the liquid header before the evaporators. When the pressure in the liquid chlorine supply line drops to 20 psi, the switchover system opens the valve isolating the standby bank of ton containers to allow liquid chlorine to flow. At the same time, it closes the ball valve on the now empty bank of ton containers. A third bank of two ton containers is also provided. These two ton containers connect to a gas header which leads to three automatic switchover type vacuum regulating valves in parallel acting as an automatic backup gas supply. \n      The system is also configured with gas headers for each of the two banks of four ton containers. This is essentially a complete gas feed system with automatic switchover capability. It can be used during periods of low chlorine demand, or if the liquid system is out of service for repairs. \n      The gaseous chlorine from the evaporators or from the chlorine gas header proceeds to the chlorinators that regulate chlorine flow and feed. Chlorine gas from the vacuum regulating valve (VRV) with check-relief units is pulled by vacuum to the chlorinators and then to the injectors. It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief units, the VRV will close, and only air would be drawn in rather than chlorine gas being released. In addition, the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve. \n      The chlorinators supply gaseous chlorine to the plant injection systems. Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the chlorinators under vacuum to the injectors"

The chlorine solution discharged from the injector is diffused into the pipelines or the reservoirs through multiple diffuser nozzles.\n      Main Process control is performed by Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) that determines the feed rate relative to the residual and water flow rates. Flow signals are transmitted to the controller.  \n      The chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms are equipped with chlorine leak detectors and are tied into the Leak Detector Control Panels in the chlorine control room. Additional chlorine detectors are located in the suction and discharge ducts for the chlorine main scrubber and the mini-scrubber. The detectors in the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms are able to detect and provide warning of the presence of chlorine gas in the air, giving a locally audible and flashing/strobe red light alarm when chlorine concentration exceeds 1 ppm by volume. The main scrubber room is equipped with a chlorine leak detector, which turns off the room ventilation system at 1 ppm. The outputs from the detectors are monitored by the SCADA system. The values can be read and alarms are generated by the system computer at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) control room. Additionally, an audio alarm is initiated to further alert control room personnel. The chlorine detector system has a battery backup. Thus, the detector system will continue operating even during a power failure.\n      All the ton containers connected to the process are equipped with automatic shutoff valve actuators which shut off the ton container angle valves when desired. These actuators close all ten ton containers (two banks of four ton containers each and one bank of two ton containers) that are connected to either the liquid or gas headers when any two of the chlorine gas detectors in the chlorine container or chlorinator rooms detect gas exceeding 10 ppm."

The scrubber can neutralize up to 4,700 lbs. of chlorine in case of a chlorine leak. The scrubber draws suction from the chlorine storage, evaporator and chlorinator rooms through a duct. The scrubber is programmed to automatically shut off once the chlorine detectors no longer detect a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm. The station is equipped with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in addition to a backup power generator. Therefore, in case of the failure of regular power, the scrubber will remain functional.\n      A dry media chlorine \"mini-scrubber\" unit (MS) has also been installed at the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station. The MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release from the pressure safety relief vent provided in the vacuum regulator check units. Mini-scrubber can neutralize up to 25 lbs. of chlorine, and the media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion. The scrubber starts automatically when chlorine concentration at the inlet detector exceeds 1 ppm. The mini-scrubber exhausts near the main scrubber intake in the evaporator room. \n      In the event power is lost at the chlorine facilities, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room. Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences. An emergency generator will automatically start and supply power to the entire system.

This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to go and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately addressed. This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process is safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate it. \n      Mechanical integrity procedures for the plant ensure that written maintenance procedures are implemented and documented, including training of maintenance personnel.\nMaintenance \n      The LADWP operates a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) software Program, an asset management program that generates a preventive maintenance work order at a designated frequency. Description of the work to be performed is included with the printed work order. The water treatment supervisor is responsible for this task.\n      In addition, the written maintenance procedure is provided in the O&M Manual as follows: Preventive maintenance schedules are provided which summarize inspection, test, and maintenance schedules on a daily, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, biannual, and annual, every 2 to 10 years, and as-needed basis. These procedures allow the operator to rapidly review what maintenance is necessary.\n      The LADWP documents inspection, testing, and maintenance of chlorination equipment and assures the performance is performed in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer and industry groups.\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change\n      Hot work refers to work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark producing operations. The hot work procedures require the issuance of a hot work permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorination pro"

Training, process safety information, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are updated according to the changes made.\nInternal Compliance Audits\n      The LADWP has been certifying every three years (or earlier) that compliance with Prevention Program requirements is met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed. The two most recent audit reports and a list of the recommendations are retained in the LADWP's files.\n      The compliance audit for the chlorination station consists of separating the RMP program elements or sections and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness. For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance Audit Checklist. The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader. The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element and contains questions that may assist with the auditing process. The audit checklist for each element consists of the following three sections:\n* Records Review: A review of the RMP written Prevention Program.\n* On-Site Conditions: The audit team will review the program elements based on observation of the plant conditions and safety practices.\n* Interviews: The program elements will be evaluated by interviewing personnel from appropriate functions including"
