This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Decatur Site is located at 1401 Finley Island Road, Decatur, Alabama 35601.  The facility is owned by BP Company North America INC.   The site manufactures paraxylene, purified terephthalic acid, and dimethyl 2,6-napthalene dicarboxylate as intermediates for the polyester industry.  In these processes, the site uses three covered flammable chemicals and no toxic chemicals in sufficient quantities to be listed. Ethylene and propane are used as refrigerants, and 1-3 butadiene is used as a reactant.  Two of the site's processes are covered under the RMP regulation. \n\nThe BP Decatur Site is subject to the Clean Air Act Title V permitting regulation and operates under permit ID: 712-0002.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nFollowing is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the BP Decatur Site.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan.  In addition, the facility has teams that address process safety and employee safety issues and that promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the site, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and management.  Some of these teams are the Site Process Safety Committee, Site HSSE Committee, and Contractor Safety Committee.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe BP Decatur Site keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Operating areas within the site are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the site has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The site assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained"

In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\n\nThe site also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and site changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe BP Decatur Site has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe BP Decatur Site exclusively uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The site has conducted HAZOP studies since 1988.\n\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed by management for resolution.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the BP Decatur Site periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and tracked.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe BP Decatur Site maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency operations, (5) emergency shutdown, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are written and updated based on a document control process and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nIn addition, safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Decatur Site has implemented a comprehensive traini"

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge and skills to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe BP Decatur Site has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

The BP Decatur Site incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe BP Decatur Site has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other site changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.

In addition, the BP Decatur Site evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. A Contractor Safety Committee actively pursues safety improvement for on-site contractors. \n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the BP Decatur Site have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied not only to all Program 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at the BP Decatur Site, but also to the entire facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the BP Decatur Site has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.  Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n2.  An on-going fugitive emissions monitoring program\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \n2. Deluge systems for specific equipment\n3. Trained emergency response personnel\n4. "

The site had no accidental releases from covered processes in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis RMP submission includes additional 1,3 Butadiene volume to account for railcars that are maintained on the site prior to storage in the site's storage vessels. \n\nThe BP Decatur Site has also evaluated the public receptors in 2011. Based on General Risk Management Program Guidance, a public receptor would include a unit that is located within the Decatur BP property boundary in which Decatur BP does not restrict access.  Therefore, the BP Decatur site now considers two additional co-located facilities on the Decatur site as public receptors. Due to the new information, the Decatur Site re-evaluated the Worst case and Alternate Worst Case Scenarios. This RMP submission includes an additional Worst Case Scenario, which could potentially impact these new public receptors. This RMP submission also contains a different Alternate Worst Case Scenario than what was submitted in 2009. RMP Comp was used to model "
