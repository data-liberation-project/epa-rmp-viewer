Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. NIPG Prince George has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \n\nFive-Year Accident History (\u00a768.155(d)) \nNIPG Prince George has not had any reportable, process related accidents or incidents during the past five (5) years. \n\n Emergency Response Plan (\u00a768.155(e)) \nNIPG is a non-responding facility. It has coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and nearby emergency responders. R152a is not required to be included in the community emergency response plan because it is not a regulated toxic substance. NIPG has also developed and implemented its own Emergency Action Plan for this facility. The Emergency Action Plan includes actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances as well as procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release. The last emergency response notification exercise was conducted on August 03, 2023\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (\u00a768.155(f)) \nSome action items have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.

NIPG Prince George\u2019s policy is to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances. If a release occurs, as a non-responding facility, our employees are on hand to coordinate evacuation and communication with emergency responders. \n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a768.155(b)) \n\nNIPG Prince George uses a threshold quantity of 1,1-Difluoroethane (R152a) in its insulated metal panel operations as a blowing agent in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation. The maximum inventory of R152a expected to be present in this facility, based on process and operational requirements, is 77,000 pounds (rounded up to two significant digits for reporting purposes). \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a768.155(c)) \n\nThis facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations for chemical accident prevention and Risk Management Plans (RMPs). The R152a process is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Additionally, the facility is also subject to the EPA\u2019s Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place. \n\nProcess Safety Information: \nNIPG Prince George has compiled the relevant data as defined in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119(d).
