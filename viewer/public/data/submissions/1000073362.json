      "SummaryText": "The Drilling Specialties Company- Alamo Plant (the DSC Plant), a division of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, is a manufacturing facility located in Conroe, Texas and is situated on approximately 44 acres. \r\n\r\nThe DSC Plant stores and uses Sulfur Trioxide in excess of the threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR Part 68.  The DSC Plant uses Sulfur Trioxide (SO3) to manufacture Soltex Additive, a drilling mud additive.\r\n\r\nThe DSC Plant began production of Soltex Additive via batch operations in 1978.  In 1987 the DSC Plant converted to continuous operations.  The facility is currently a division of the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP as the result of a 2001 joint venture. \r\n\r\nThe DSC Plant is subject to the RMP Program 3 reporting requirements as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 because the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard set forth in 29 CFR Subpart 1910.119. The site does not meet the threshold for requiring a Title V operating permit.\r\n \r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM  \r\n\r\nThe DSC Plant's accident prevention program documents the facility's compliance with the requirements of both the OSHA PSM Standard and the EPA RMP Rule.  The DSC Plant manages process safety utilizing management systems and procedures.  In addition, the site relies on employee participation from all levels of the organization.   \r\nThe DSC plant has been an OSHA STAR VPP Site since 2005. This voluntary program is a partnership between OSHA and industry to recognize and encourage excellence and continuous improvement in safety programs for those facilities that go above and beyond the minimum regulatory requirements. STAR certification represents the highest form of recognition OSHA can give a company for outstanding safety performance.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTIONS\r\n\r\nThe chemical specific preventions for SO3 Unloading involves utilizing an Automated SO3 Unloading Sequential Program on the DCS to automat"

The automated program is based on the approved critical work instruction cOWI-310, which was developed and has been successfully used to safely unload SO3 Railcars for several years. The site utilizes unloading hoses that are stainless steel braided hoses with additional support to prevent unwanted binding or crimping. The transfer hoses are proactively replaced every year to ensure hose integrity.  \r\n\r\nThe facility also utilizes remote video camera monitoring.  This allows the DCS Operator in the control room to monitor system integrity during unloading operation. The DCS Operator also has the capability to quickly isolate the railcar unloading system by activating an automatic shut-off valve located at the unloading station in the event of a release.  Additionally, a deluge system can be remotely operated in the event of a transfer hose leak. \r\n\r\nThe DSC Plant also maintains SIL2-Rated and DCS automated safeguards to ensure that SO3 unloading does not cause the SO3 storage tank to overfill. \r\nThe DSC Plant also consults with external subject matter experts on the safe handling and storage of SO3 to ensure the facility's equipment and practices are up-to-date with the manufacturers recommended best practices.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nAlarm Systems \r\n\r\nThe DSC Plant has an internal plant wide alarm system for fires and emergencies.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Responders  \r\n\r\nThe DSC Plant has an Emergency Response Plan (Integrated Contingency Plan) for handling releases of hazardous substances. The plan provides the DSC Plant with a system of readiness which includes procedures for the orderly transition from normal to emergency operations, a design for delegation of emergency authority and responsibility, a method for interfacing with other (outside) emergency organizations and a means of controlling the emergency. The DSC Plant's emergency organization is structured according to the Incident Command Center (ICC), so all aspects"

The Emergency Response Plan also incorporates pre-emergency planning via the use of monthly What-If scenarios and emergency response drills that include event simulation and actual hands-on training. The facility routinely trains with the local emergency responders to ensure that they are familiar with the plant and the potential hazards. The facility has recently installed a new accountability system which utilizes electronic badging system to account for all personnel on site. \r\n\r\nCommunications Link to Offsite Responders\r\n\r\nThe DSC ICC is the central communication point for any emergencies that may occur at the facility. The ICC is staffed by Management, and Health & Safety personnel, as well as individuals who are on call for the facility Incident Command System.  Local emergency assistance is obtained by calling 911.  Local Fire Department is Caney Creek which would be non-hazmat response. Hazmat response is mutual aid with the Conroe Fire Department and The Woodlands Fire Department.  The DSC Plant Safety Representative participates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Additionally, the DSC Plant hosts local area fire department tours to familiarize local area fire departments with the DSC Plant layout and the potential hazards at the facility.

Improvements are designed to address both overall process safety and personnel safety. \r\n\r\nOn the process safety front, the facility adopted a new corporate mechanical integrity tracking program.  This program tracks inspection plans, inspection results, and all associated corrective recommendations.  The facility also evaluates small bore piping for removal or strengthening to reduce the risk of vibration induced failure. \r\n\r\nRegarding personal safety, the site developed and communication a list of Life Saving Rules for both employees and contractors to use that should protect personnel and prevent process safety incidents.  The site also implemented a \"Summer of Safety\" program designed to reduce the potential for heat stress for all employees on site. . \r\nAll employees at the DSC Plant are encouraged to identify and recommend corrections to any unsafe work practices, procedures and equipment that they identify.  All recommendations are discussed by DSC Plant management during monthly employee meetings and suggested improvements to enhance plant safety are continuously evaluated and when applicable, adopted and implemented."
