This approach to prevention is implemented through programs that incorporate requirements of the EPA Risk Management Plan, the OSHA Process Safety Mangagement standard, and the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care iniative.  In addition to these programs, we have implemented chemical-specific safety features to help monitor, detect, and mitigate accidental releases such as gas detectors, redundant instrumentation and controls, water curtains, and personal protective equipment.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\n\r\nThis facility has not experienced an operating accident during the past five years per the reporting criteria. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nAt Plant David M.

Our written program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, procedures are in place to address maintencance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  The overall emergency response program for the facility is coordinated with an external Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nAt Plant David M.
