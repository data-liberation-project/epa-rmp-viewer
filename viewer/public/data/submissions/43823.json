It assumes that all safety systems in the facility simultaneously fail and that all of the chemical in the largest container holding it at a site is released in a very short time. USEPA-designated table defines the distance the material will travel until it disperses so much that it is no longer hazardous.\n\nThe worst case release scenario at General Chemical \u00bf Bay Point Works assumes that a rail car containing Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride fails. The USEPA requires us to assume that all safety and release prevention systems fail, and the contents are released in 10 minutes. The USEPA- designated table states that the material released would travel 25 miles before it reaches a non--hazardous concentration.\n\n 3.2 \tAlternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative case release scenario is a more credible hypothetical, site-specific chemical release. It takes into account safety and release prevention systems and procedures used at the plant to control releases. It is more realistic than the worst case release scenario is calculated based on a USEPA-designated table, and is used to plan a facility's emergency response to accidents.\n\n3.2.1\tThe alternative case release scenario for Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride at Bay Point Works assumes Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride would be lost due to the failure of a transfer hose during the unloading process. It takes into account plant safety systems designed to limit a release. The USEPA-designated tables state that the material released would travel 1.05 miles before reaching a non-hazardous concentration.\n\n3.2.2\tThe alternative case release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia at Bay Point Works assumes Anhydrous Ammonia would be lost due to the failure of a transfer hose during the unloading process.

The program must consist of a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program. Additionally, the operator must describe the site's risk management program in a risk management plan (RMP). However, the regulation provides for three different programs of compliance dependent upon the eligibility criteria of covered processes including, but not limited to, the potential impact of chemical releases as identified in the hazard assessment. For example, chemical processes which meet the criteria for program level 1 and program level 2 have very minimal requirements for release prevention programs and emergency response as compared to those for program level 3.\n\nAt General Chemical \u00bf Bay Point Works, three listed chemicals are managed on site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria. No chemicals are managed on site under program 1 or program 2 criteria. The chemicals managed according to program level 3 include Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride and Hydrochloric Acid. As identified in this plan, Bay Point Works is in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for management of Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride and Hydrochloric Acid.\n\nThis RMP describes Bay Point Work's risk management program, which includes a hazard assessment, release prevention program and emergency response pr"
