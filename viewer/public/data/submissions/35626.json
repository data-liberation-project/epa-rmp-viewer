Emergency preparedness procedures including emergency response, spill mitigation, evacuation procedures, alarms, and emergency phone numbers have been implemented by Unified Western Grocers.  In addition, Unified Wetsern Grocers has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\nThe Risk Management Program, the Emergency Response Plan, standard operating procedures, and Process Safety Management Manual document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Unified Western Grocers.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nUnified Western Grocers is located at 6433 SE Lake Road in Milwaukie, Oregon.  The facility is situated within a commercial and residential area.  The facility performs operations common to the dairy industry by utilizing an ammonia refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for frozen food products.  The ammonia system contains a maximum of approximately 11,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nUnified Western Grocers has developed and implemented a Risk Management Program with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by USEPA.
