This commitment is inherent in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of processes involving regulated substances. Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant has coordinated with local and other emergency response organizations which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances \nThe main manufacturing activities at this plant involve the production of plastic consumer products such as polystyrene foam plates, food containers, and trays.  We have one substance present at our facilities that are regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program.  The substance is a flammable mixture; and is referenced in this document by the term \"regulated substance\".  The flammable mixture at our facility is used as a foaming agent in the production of the polystyrene foam.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of blowing agent possible at our facility exceeds the 10,000-pound RMP threshold. Written operating procedures and high-level alarms prevent overfilling the storage tanks. \n\n3.   The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA's 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 S"

We also have an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act. This facility has received a Star Ranking under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) for over 16 years.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPactic Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating guidelines and equipment designs associated with the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts extensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The approach used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP/Modified What If process.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations, and safety and are revalidated at a regular interval of approximately every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Pactiv Corporation  maintains written operating procedures for the blowing agent systems.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nPactic Corporation utilizes a detailed training program to ensure that employees who are operating processes using regulated substances are skilled in the handling, operation, and maintenance procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every year and more frequently as neede"

Process equipment examined these inspections include but are not limited to pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel, with training in maintenance practices, carry out maintenance operations.  These personnel are provided specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures at Pactiv Corporation are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes and provided training, as needed, to deal with these changes.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Pactic Corporation.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that equipment and procedures are complete and suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPactiv Corporation conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the requirements set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPactiv Corporation promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

Reports are kept for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPactiv Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Many employees participate in safety initiatives within the plant.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance and program is carried out.  Pactiv Corporation has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nHot Work \nThe facility maintains a hot work program and issues a hot work permit for hot work conducted on or near the covered process.  Qualified personnel who complete each permit and fulfill its requirements prior to the start of a hot work operation perform hot work.  These permits are kept posted at the worksite until the conclusion of the hot work operation. Completed permits are kept on file for 3 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n4.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including prompt notification of local emergency response agencies and the public; emergency evacuations, if necessary; adequate first aid and medical treatment should any be necessary.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. In addition, emergency response equipment (fire extinguishers, etc) is regularly inspected and serviced. \n\n6.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  All recommendations from the last PHA for the blowing agent systems (conducted on September 24, 2002) were completed by May 23, 2003.  \n\nOur facility has exemplary occupational safety and health programs that encompass employee involvement, recognition for safe work, partnership with OSHA and continuous hazard identification activities.  To enhance our continuous improvement in occupational safety and health, we conduct an annual safety plan evaluation that focuses in on the key areas of safety program management.  OSHA has identified these areas as the key elements in a safety program.  From the annual safety plan evaluation, actions to correct areas of deficiencies are defined and assigned a responsible party and completion date.  All areas are targeted for completion by the end of each year."
