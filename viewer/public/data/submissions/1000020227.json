      "SummaryText": "The City of Chandler operates a water treatment plant in the southwest area of Chandler,Oklahoma. The plant used chlorine to disinfect potable water used by its citizens. Safety for the plant personnel and our neighbors is the foremost concern of city employees. Our policy is to minimize any possible hazard associated with the use of chlorine to personnel,the environment,and community neighbors. We have specific safety training and procedures implemented to assure safe use of this chemical. This saftey training is backed up with preventive maintanence,safe handling,and various safety features which take place during use so that each individual knows what is expected or what he is to contribute in handling this product. The maximum ton container inventory is two. With only two containers in use at a time. Maximum release of chlorine in case of broken valve or ruptured line would not exceed 4000 pounds at any time and would affect 750 residents per square mile. Our plan contains procedures for notifying the proper authorities,and those in the immediate vicinity who would need to be evacuated immediately from the area. Through diligence and training we have had no releases."
