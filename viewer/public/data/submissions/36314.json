      "SummaryText": "The Borough of Hanover Municipal Authority owns and operates a potable water treatment and distribution system for the Borough of Hanover, located in York and Adams Counties, Pennsylvania, and for some surrounding communities.  This system is operated by the Borough of Hanover.  The water treatment plant located at 235 Old Hanover Road processes up to 11 million gallons per day of water drawn from the South Branch Conewego Creek to yield potable water.  Treatment processes include pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, fluoridation, and chlorine disinfection.  Chemical addition is utilized to control taste, odor, and corrosion.  The plant is typically operated 24 hours per day, Monday through Saturday, with 8-hour coverage on Sundays and major holidays.\n\n\tThe water treatment plant includes a chlorination room, which contains four (4) one ton cylinders of chlorine liquefied under pressure, a chlorinator, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  The chlorinator system uses remote vacuum actuated feed lines and has high pressure regulators attached directly to the chlorine vessel gas valves, to mitigate against high pressure gas releases through the chlorinator system.  Water treatment operators regularly check the room and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the rate as necessary.  The maximum intended inventory is 8,000 pounds.\n\nThe Borough of Hanover=s Municipal Water Works Filter plant accidental release prevention program is based upon the following elements:\n\n1.\tHigh level of training for the operators;\n\n2.\tPreventative maintenance program for equipment;\n\n3.\tUse of modern process and safety equipment;\n\n4.\tUse of accurate and effective standard operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators;\n\n5.\tPerformance of a Hazard Review of the equipment and procedures; and\n\n6.\tImplementation of an auditing an"

      "SummaryText": "d inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA,) awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chlorine gas detector connected to an alarm and telephone dialer.\n\n\tNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five (5) years.\n\n\tThe facility has an emergency response program which has been reviewed and coordinated by the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Gettysburg.  The operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated on an annual basis by the Adams County LEPC.  The Adams County Defensive Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response Team is the designated first-responder in the event of a chlorine leak incident.  This HAZMAT team, however, is trained only at the Technician Level but is not State Certified; they can provide limited support for chlorine leak containment.  Under a mutual aid agreement between Adams County and Cumberland County, the Cumberland County Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response Team will provide additional support for chlorine leak repair.  This HAZMAT team is state certified and undergoes extensive training in dealing with a variety of hazardous material incidents, including chlorine gas leaks.  \n\nRecommendations to improve safety were made following a June 1, 2004 inspection of the disinfection systems by the Borough's consulting engineer.  These recommendations included improvements to written emergency standard operating procedures, and the development of an operator training program which provides annual refresher training on proper safety and handling of chlorine, as well as chlorine leak response procedures."
