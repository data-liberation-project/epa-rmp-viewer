      "SummaryText": "We are a fertilizer retail facility.  Our facility has two atmospheric-pressure 20,000 gallon aqua ammonia storage tanks and storage tanks for other fertilizers that are not considered hazardous under provisions of the Risk Management Plan.   We also have equipment for receiving aqua by truck, and equipment for transferring aqua from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling aqua.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences, and to protect against off site impacts, our storage tanks are enclosed in a diked area.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  We have also coordinated with the Garfield County Volunteer Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This scenario involves release of the entire contents of the largest storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the effect from this scenario would only extend 0.19 miles (1000 feet) from our facility, and would not includet any residences, schools, or industrial areas.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPAs worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the effect from such a release would only extend 520 feet, and also would not include any residences, schools, or industrial areas."
