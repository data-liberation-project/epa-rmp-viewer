              "Description": "The Branch Manager implements the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Risk Management Program (RMPr) for the Storage & Handling of anhydrous ammonia at this facility and is assisted by other Helena staff as directed. The Risk Management Program includes an Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation. Equipment included under this covered process includes (1) a 30,000-gallon storage tank and ancillary pumps, piping, and valves, (2) 36 1,000-gallons nurse tanks, and (3) 18 1,450-gallon nurse tanks. Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the nurse tanks.\n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 9,000-gallon commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation. At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its vendor for review and a copy of its RMPr Document upon request.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Mattoon Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Mattoon Facility located approximately 2.3 miles west of Mattoon at 2885 East County Road 800 North, Mattoon, IL 61938.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Mattoon Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Mattoon Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena recently acquired this Facility and has submitted this 5-Year update to reflect the new ownership.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Mattoon Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,000 gallon) and then transferred to a single 30,000-gallon stationary storage"

      "SummaryText": " tank.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in its single on-site storage tank and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates 36 1,000-gallon and 18 1,450-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its Risk Management Program that includes a prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the ammonia storage and filling process. The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 3-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since excess flow valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the ruptured transfer line.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Branch Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the imple"

The RMP will be updated as the Mattoon Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Coles County LEPC and Mattoon Fire Department.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Mattoon Facility."
