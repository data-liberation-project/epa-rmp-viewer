              "Description": "The following is brief summary of the prevention program in place at Moorhead Water Treatment Plant to reduce the risk of a chlorine release. \n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nMoorhead Public Service recognizes that it is essential to involve its employees in the development and implementation of an OSHA PSM and EPA RMP Program at all Moorhead Public Service facilities subject to the OSHA PSM and/or EPA RMP regulations. The purpose of this plan is to define how employees will be involved.\n\n\n\nEmployees have been significantly involved in the development of the prevention program, especially in the areas of process hazard analysis, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures. They have been trained on and encouraged to review all areas of the prevention program.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nComplete and up-to-date process safety information is required to successfully implement most RMP Program elements, including PHAs, training, emergency planning and response, management of change, incident investigation, and compliance audits. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that current written process safety information is developed and maintained in a format that provides easy access by employees, PHA teams, and auditors.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Moorhead Public Service conducted a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation using Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) method to identify, evaluate, and control the risk associated with process hazards or changes implemented to the chlorine system highly hazardous chemical (HHC) release scenarios at all Moorhead Public Service facilities subject to the OSHA PSM and/or EPA RMP regulations. The overall purpose of the PHA changes was to ensure compliance with these EPA regulations and to prevent or minimize the effects of a chemical release. Recommendations were made during the PHA to reduce the risk associated with a hazard or release scenario to an acceptable level. \n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the process change in 2012 was to improve safety at the Moorhead Water Plant by removing pressurized piping from the chlorine system and replace it with vacuum components. Feeding chlorine gas by vacuum significantly reduces the risk of a chlorine leak.  Procedures were created/updated for the new equipment based on manufacturer recommendations. All documents relating to Standard Operating Procedures are reviewed by staff on an annual basis to ensure best practices are being followed. Revalidation of these processes took place during the 2017 PHA and 2018 RMP audits.  \n\n\n\nPERSONNEL TRAINING\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that personnel working on or near OSHA PSM and/or EPA RMP-regulated processes are adequately trained and understand the inherent process hazards and appropriate response actions to accidental chemical releases. Regulated processes at the facility include the chlorination processes.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTOR SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that only contractors with good health and safety programs are selected to perform work on and around processes that use highly hazardous chemicals, and that the contractors and the processes are properly prepared to safely complete the work. Processes that use highly hazardous chemicals currently include the chlorine processes.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\n\n\nA Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) will be performed for new processes regulated under OSHA PSM and EPA RMP, and modified existing regulated processes when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that the facility is ready to safely operate new and modified regulated processes.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the mechanical integrity program is to ensure the continued integrity of process equipment. An effective mechanical integrity program is integral to preventing accidental chemical releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment. The program follows manufacturer's recommendations for maintenance of equipment. Some maintenance schedules for equipment have been modified from the manufactures recommendations based on experience with the equipment. \n\n\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that a hot work permit is issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the chlorine processes. Hot work is defined as any work that may generate a source of ignition and includes but is not limited to welding, torch cutting, and use of spark-producing equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Management of Change (MoC) procedure is to ensure that system changes are properly reviewed against original system design specifications and can be accomplished safely, and that the systems are ready to operate safely in accordance with original system design intent following implementation of the change.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nAll incidents at the Moorhead Water Plant, which resulted in or could have reasonably resulted in a release of chlorine, will be promptly investigated. The purpose of the incident investigation procedure is to identify the underlying cause(s) of an incident and to implement corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nThe purpose of compliance audits is to ensure audits are performed to evaluate Moorhead Water Plant process safety and risk management programs, and their implementation for compliance with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations. Whenever necessary, the audit will identify recommendations to address program deficiencies.",

It contains all of the information required by Section 68.155 2017.\n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention policies are represented in Sections 2 through 13 of this document. The emergency response policy is represented in Sections 14.  MPS takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at this facility by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of processes subject to the Part 68 rule.  They are also trained in the safe handling of all chemicals regulated by the rule.\n\n\n\nIn addition to ensure its employees are adequately trained, MPS works to prevent accidents by providing and revising written procedures for operating its covered processes, as needed, under the rule. Although these procedures in and of themselves should prevent accidental releases, MPS maintains and follows a policy of compliance audits, the goals of which are to determine if existing procedures are adequate and, if they are, to ensure that they are followed.\n\n\n\nMPS has also developed and maintained a risk management policy that contains general safety rules.  The general safety rules fall under Minnesota's Chapter 182 Occupational Safety and Health Act.  The safety and health program is required to meet Minnesota's A Workplace Accident and Incident Reduction (AWAIR) Program. This program covers topics such as personal protection equipment, hazard communications, confined space, respiratory protection, excavation and trenching, lock-out/tag-out, and bloodborne disease exposure control.  Although these general rules do not specifically address the covered processes and their regulated substances, compliance with the general rules will significantly reduce the potential for accidental release of these substan"

In the worst case release scenario, EPA defined parameters were used with the local three-year maximum temperature and average relative humidity. The radius of the modeled chlorine plume was updated to 2.1 miles and had a potential population impact of 31,774 65,176 in Moorhead and surrounding communities. In the alternate release scenario, a leaky ton cylinder on a delivery truck was modeled. This release reached approximately 155 yards.  The residential population impacted was zero, but employees at the site would be affected.   \n\n\n\nMoorhead Public Service management understands its duty to provide a safe working environm"

Water is treated through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations including lime softening, ozone disinfection and recarbonation, filtration, and secondary disinfection using monochloramines. The MWTP design capacity is 16 million gallons per day.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance stored, handled, and used at this facility is chlorine, which is stored onsite in one-ton containers and is used to disinfect treated water. The maximum intended inventory of chlorine is four (4) one-ton cylinders, or 8,000 pounds of chlorine on site.  All of the containers are stored inside of a temperature controlled building.\n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR COVERED CHEMICALS\n\n\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in Section 2 through Section 13 of this document.

The chlorine containers are kept inside of a building to mitigate the effects of the release.  More importantly, MWTP has installed a scrubber capable of neutralizing one ton of chlorine, the amount stored in the largest single container on-site.  The scrubber is maintained twice monthly to ensure proper operation in case it would be needed during a chlorine release. In addition, an automatic Halogen Valve shutdown system for the online ton cylinder tank valves is installed. If a leak is detected by online monitors, the shutdown system is activated and will close the cylinder valves, reducing the impact of a leak. The MWTP also has a 1.3 MW natural gas generator for back-up power for the chlorine scrubber that was installed in 2015 as part of the High Service Pumping Station Project.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances from this facility during the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency evacuation procedure for employees.

The new system components feed chlorine gas via vacuum directly from the tank valve to the Hydro-Omni Valve where it is mixed into utility water solution and fed into the water supply for disinfection. Removing pressurized piping along with other safeguards such as chlorine gas detectors, automatic shutoff valves, and a chlorine scrubber reduce the risks associated with chlorine gas. Staff is continuously evaluating options for improving chlorine safety. \n\n\n\nDuring the development of this RMP document, hazard reviews were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements. During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases. Each recommendation was considered and evaluated for implementation.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
