A list of recommended actions were developed to further improve the chlorine and ammonia safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nMDWASD Alexander Orr WTP has prepared written operating procedures that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to the chlorination and ammoniation processes.  They are consistent with the chlorine and ammonia Process Safety Information.  Written operating procedures include: initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and start up after emergency shutdown.  In addition, Alexander Orr WTP developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the following steps in the chlorination and ammoniation processes: receipt of chlorine and ammonia delivery, chlorine car connection and disconnection, transferring car from standby to in-service, and chlorine and ammonia release/spill response.  Operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or changes made in the handling of chlorine and ammonia equipment, and reconfiguration of the facilities.\n\nTraining \n\nAlexander Orr WTP employees presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine and ammonia processes are trained in an overview of the processes and the applicable operating and maintenance procedures.

The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario. EPA also requires the performance of one worst-case release scenario for all the regulated toxic substances and one alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance used in a covered process. \n\nChlorine and ammonia are the two regulated toxic substances stored and handled at the Alexander Orr WTP, which are subject to the RMP rule.  Since chlorine was estimated to create the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint, thus, chlorine was selected for the worst-case release scenario.  Only passive or administrative controls are allowed under this scenario to reduce off-site impacts.  The scenario used for the Alexander Orr WTP is the rupture of a single 90-ton chlorine railcar resulting in the release of 180,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration.  There are no passive or administrative controls at the Alexander Orr WTP for the chlorine railcars; thus, the chlorine release rate will be 18,000 lbs./min.\n\nThe released liquid chlorine is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.06).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.

The results of the dispersion analysis indicated that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nRMP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario may also be an actual event, which occurred at the facility.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider active mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios selected for the chlorine and ammonia are summarized below:\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected involves the release of chlorine from the flexible hose connecting the railcar to the chlorine process.  This scenario occurs due to the operator using a faulty old flex hose, which results in a crack in the flex hose during the withdrawal of chlorine from the railcar.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the 1-inch diameter flex hose equates to a hole of 3/16-inch (0.1875-inch) diameter.  The control room would have been warned of the chlorine leak by the chlorine monitors installed at the chlorination facility.  It is assumed that approximately ten minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond and activate the remote controlled shutoff valve.  The chlorine release rate for this alternative release scenario was estimated at 87 lb./min.  No passive mitigation was considered for the estimation of chlorine release rate.  However, human input in closing the shut-off valve was taken into account as an active mitigation, which will reduce the quantity of chlorine released to the atmosphere.\n\nThe toxic endpoint distance for the chlorine alternative relea"

The gas then flows from the evaporator through another automatic shut-off valve, a strainer, a pressure regulating valve, a temperature actuated control valve, and a vacuum regulator, to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas rotameter and a v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water. The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of water borne disease in drinking water.  There are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination. The breakpoint chlorination process consists of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The chloramination process lowers the trihalomethane levels in the finished water.\n\nThe Miami-Dade Water & Sewer Department (MDWASD) Alexander Orr Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in the finished drinking water to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine and ammonia can create hazardous situations.  The Alexander Orr WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals, including ammonia as seriously as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\n\nThe Alexander Orr WTP chlorine and ammonia handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n* O"

Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Metro-Dade Fire Department may be solicited to aid in handling chlorine or ammonia release.  As part of the emergency response program, the Alexander Orr WTP has developed and implemented an emergency action plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.\n\nThe emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (Metro-Dade Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine and ammonia response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, site response team, and site safety representative, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all employees involved with the chlorination and ammoniation processes. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine and ammonia process in 1997 for chlorination and ammoniation systems equipment and procedures, when Process Safety Management (PSM) Plans were prepared. All of these recommended actions have been evaluated for implementation as required."
