It is our policy to implement appropriate controls for prevention of possible releases of hazardous substances.  If such a release should accidently occur at Frac 6,8 our responses are coordinated with authorities such as Mont Belvieu's Police & Fire Departments, and Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu (MAMB).\r\n\r\nThe Frac 6,8 plant involves activities related to extraction and fractionation of products from raw Y Grade feed.  The Plant currently consists 1 unit (Frac 6) capable of processing approximately 150,000 BPD of Y-Grade feed.  When completed, Frac 8 will be essentially identical to Frac 6 and will also be rated at 150,000 BPD.  Covid issues halted construction of Frac 8 and future construction will reconvene at some undetermined future date.  Frac feedstock is delivered to Mont Belvieu via pipeline.
