      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nHanover Foods Corporation (Hanover) is committed to the safe operation of the Clayton, Delaware facility.  This commitment is demonstrated by the significant use of resources expended in process control equipment, employee training, and management oversight.  Hanover uses a written safety policy that outlines its concern and commitment to safety.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nHanover is a diverse processor of fresh, frozen, and canned food product.  The Clayton, Delaware facility, the subject of this RMP, processes frozen foods.  The plant uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant due to its unique properties.  The ammonia refrigeration system consists of a main receiver, three additional receivers, seven freezers, three cold storage units, two chiller rooms, and associated piping and process control equipment.  The refrigeration system also includes two flume chillers and a spinach chiller system.  The maximum amount of ammonia in the system at any time is 93,585 pounds.  Ammonia is the only EPA RMP regulated substance exceeding the threshold quantity at the site.  The ammonia refrigeration system falls under Prevention Program 3 of the RMP.\n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the catastrophic release of 18,000 pounds of ammonia from the high pressure receiver on the Frigo-pak, which is the largest vessel in the system.  In accordance with the RMP regulation, the release was modeled over a 10 minute period with no mitigating factors.  The distance to the toxic endpoint would reach off-site receptors.  EPA's model, RMP*Comp, was used in calculating the extent of the release.\n\n\n\nBecause of the probability of the worst-case scenario is minute, EPA allows calculation of an alternative release scenario.  Hanover alternate release scenario has a greater chance of occurring than the worst-case scenario.  Hanover's alternative release scenario"

      "SummaryText": " is a relief valve lifting on the Frigo-pak pump package receiver.  Ammonia would be released at an estimated 42.8 pounds per minute for 60 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint would not reach off-site receptors.  RMP*Comp was used in calculating the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nHanover understands the risks of using ammonia, and has several active programs in place to mitigate any potential problems.  Hanover is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management, and utilizes the 12 elements, including process hazard analysis, standard operating procedures, and employee training, to manage our system.  All changes are reviewed by the management of change system, and process hazard reviews are conducted before being placed into operation.  A computerized preventive maintenance program is also in place.  This facility is staffed by qualified refrigeration personnel 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\n\n\nHanover utilizes a Manning Systems ammonia detection/ventilation control system consisting of four sensors in the main engine room and one in the Frigo-pak compressor room.  Hanover also has ammonia detectors in each of the three cold storage freezers, and one in the Wet Pack production room.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Hanover Clayton, DE facility had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia in the last five years. As described in Section 6, the facility released a small amount of ammonia while performing a maintenance activity.  The wind blew the gas towards a local elementary school, which was eventually evacuated as a result.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nHanover maintains a written emergency response plan that includes evacuation procedures, emergency coordinator responsibilities, notification procedures, and emergency medical procedures.  The facility has a fully staffed and trained emergency response team that would respond to an ammonia emergency at the site."

Hanover will continue to use these guidelines in the management of the refrigeration system.\n\n"
