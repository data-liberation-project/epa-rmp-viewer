The facility policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Meyers Liquid Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of ammonium hydroxide.  If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Frederick County Emergency Response Coordinator, Fire and Police Departments, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n  2. Facility information.\n\n       - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers.                                                                                                                                                             \n    - Anhydrous ammonia is stored for production nutrients.  The maximum quantity at the facility would be 280,000 pounds stored in the two-30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n       - Ammonium Hydroxide is stored in two separate 20,000 gallon tanks, which are within an enclosed dike.  The dike would allow rapid recovery of any spilled or released ammonium hydroxide liquid.  The maximum quantity stored would be 300,000 pounds in our two-20,000 gallon storage tanks.\n\n  3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n \n       a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a 30,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank.   The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.16 miles.\n\n       b. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammoia, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles.\n   \n       c. The alternative release scenario for ammonium hydroxide, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in"

      "SummaryText": " a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.09 miles.\n  \n  4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of  \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".    \n\n  5. The five-year accident history \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or ammonium hydroxide in the past five years that:\n  - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n  - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n  6. The emergency response program.\n\n  - The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan with Frederick Countys Emergency Response Coordinator dated March, 1996.\n\n  7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific ammonium hydroxide safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
