The recognition and control of risks are instrumental to the safe, efficient, and environmentally compliant operation of the refinery.  The refinery's accident prevention and risk management plan is organized to be consistent with the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation, which provided for systematic and comprehensive attention to key elements of process hazard management, addressing issues of technology, personnel, and equipment.  This structure facilitates our overall program which emphas accident prevention through safe design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes.  Even though we empha the prevention of accidents, we also maintain a highly trained, qualified, and well-equipped emergency response organization to quickly respond to and mitigate an incident should one occur.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Refinery, located in Linden, New Jersey, operates a wide variety of operating processes to convert raw crude oil into useable petroleum products for our customers.  The refinery produces many commonly used petroleum products, including gasoline, heating oil, diesel, jet fuel, propane, butane, petrochemical feedstocks and polypropylene.  These products and their production account for numerous regulated flammable substances being present on site, including propane, butane, hydrogen, and mixtures of other regulated flammable substances.  The Bayway Refinery does not exceed the EPA threshold quantity for any RMP regulated toxic materials.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Refinery has had an excellent accident record over the history of the facility, and has not experienced an incident in the past five years involving the release of a regulated substance which meets the RMP reporting requirements. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROG"

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.  In addition to the OSHA PSM regulation, the refinery is also regulated by the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) for processes covered by that regulation.\r\n\r\nThe following elements represent numerous programs and practices that the Bayway Refinery has institutionalized as Management Systems.  Through the establishment, review, and continuous improvement of these management systems, the Bayway Refinery demonstrates its commitment to operating a safe, healthy, and environmentally sound facility.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include safety committee involvement, developing and reviewing safe operating procedures, and participation in the process hazard analysis program.  Information on the refinery's prevention program is available to all employees, and they are encouraged to recommend improvements to any of the programs.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan elements of the PSM Management Systems Documentation.  Copies of this document are maintained at the refinery and address each element of the accidental release prevention program.  In addition to this program, the refinery has a strong commitment to following written policies and procedures, and encourages employee's input to identify when a policy or procedure needs to be changed or improved to cover new tasks, revised regulations, or employee experie"

Through this teamwork, a determination can be made to update the policy or procedure, and then train everyone involved on the revised requirements.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATON\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Refinery maintains an extensive library of Process Safety Information which includes information related to chemicals in the process, the technology of the process, and equipment in the process.  These documents include detailed information on chemical properties and their associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The process safety information is available to all employees, either directly on the unit, via the refinery's intranet, or by contacting their supervisor.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including hazards, protective measures, symptoms, and first aid procedures is provided via Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's) or Safety Data Sheets (SDS's).  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, flow, and level).  These are documented in the Operating Conditions and Controls section of the unit Operating Manuals.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computer process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shut down systems).\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains technical documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised."

      "SummaryText": "PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Refinery primarily utilizes the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted by a team representing operating experience, as well as safety and engineering expertise.  This team systematically identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as existing accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \r\n\r\nThe PHA team's recommendations are forwarded to the management of the involved unit or area for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation measures in response to PHA findings is based on the relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All mitigation measures being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are resolved.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process operation and controls do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety parameters, the Bayway Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analyses.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, any team findings are forwarded to the unit or area management for resolution, with the final resolution of the findings documented and retain"

These procedures are located in an operating manual that is used as a reference by unit operators and provides a basis for consistent initial or refresher training of operators.  The procedures are maintained by the involved area operating personnel, and are updated to reflect changes identified through the Management of Change process, through refresher training, or changes/improvements identified through normal operating experience.  The operating manual is reviewed annually to ensure that it is current, updated, and accurate.  The operating procedures are readily available to all personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job.  \r\n\r\nOPERATOR TRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Bayway Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New refinery operations employees (candidates) must successfully complete up to 8 weeks of basic training in refinery operations before being assigned to a unit-specific training program.  Basic training addresses applied sciences, job fundamentals, process operations, and understanding basic refining processes and operations.  The time necessary to successfully complete unit-specific training varies with the requirements of each job.

This is achieved by pre-qualifying contractors to bid on refinery contracts (documented via the Contactor Qualification Form), and if selected, providing those contractors with pertinent information prior to their beginning work including (1) a process overview, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) required safe work practices.  Contractor employees attend initial and annual training on Bayway's site-specific safety and health requirements.  A program of job site auditing is used to monitor contractor performance.  The contractor is also required to perform self-evaluations of their safety programs and resulting performance.  Refinery personnel perform periodic formal reviews of the safety and quality of the contractors work while on-site.  \r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Refinery conducts a PSSR for a new facility or facility modification to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  Checklists are utilized to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that applicable prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTIC"
