The San Juan Basin Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant that recovers hydrocarbon liquids from unprocessed natural gas.  Two natural gas inlet streams (Low Pressure System and High Pressure System) are delivered via pipeline to the plant.  The recovered hydrocarbon liquids are transported via pipeline to fractionation plants for further processing and eventual sales.  After processing, the residue gas from which the hydrocarbon liquids are recovered is delivered to a gas pipeline for eventual sales.  The San Juan Basin Gas Plant operation inclu"

[Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the plant in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity: Ethane-Propane-Butane-Condensate (EPBC) mix, Propane-Butane-Condensate (PBC) mix, condensate, propane, and natural gas.  [Note:  Condensate is exempt from threshold determination provisions of the regulations based on its National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of \r\n3.] There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe San Juan Basin Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the plant does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure for flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  The EPBC (Ethane-Propane-Butane-Condensate) Mix was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the EPBC in"

[Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\r\n\r\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantaneously released.  We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors.  In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are placed in service, and the San Juan Basin Gas Plant follows a rigorous Mechanical Integrity Program to ensure that all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected, to prevent leakage or failure.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations require the operator to model a single \"alternative release scenario\" for all regulated flammable substances.  For the San Juan Basin Gas Plant, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a seal failure on a pump, which was assumed to last for five minutes.  \r\n\r\nPassive mitigation systems such as leak detection, gas detection, and emergency shutdown systems would enable the plant to isolate and eliminate such a release within that time-frame.  The alternative release scenario has off-site impact, but there is no impact to any receptors (i.e., residential populations, industrial, etc.), as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance, the \"Landview\" program census data, and actual survey data.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe San Juan Basin Gas Plant adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.

In addition, each operator receives facility-specific training on how to operate the plant, including detailed training on the operating procedures, including startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, and emergency operations.  As part of this training, an operator in training is paired with an experienced operator, as a mentor, to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through peer review and skills demonstration) the knowledge level needed to perform their duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, then and only then, will they be allowed to work independently.
