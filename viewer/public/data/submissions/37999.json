      "SummaryText": "The North Charleston Sewer District Waste Water Treatment Plant is a 27 MGD domestic waste water treatment plant located in the City of Charleston, South Carolina.  Waste water is received from the service area of about 55 sauare miles.  The treatment process is conventional activated sludge method of secondary treatment.  The treated or cleansed water passes from the final clafifiers into two chlorine contact chambers where chlorine is injected into the water to disinfect any remaining bacteria and pathogens.\n\nChlorine is considered a toxic substance and the plant operators take every precaution to ensure that the chlorine gas is not released into the atmosphere.  There has not been a release of chlorine gas at the facility during the past five years.  There are numerous safe guards to prevent the accidential release of chlorine gas.  Surrounding the chlorine unloading platform there are monitors that will operate automatic shut off valves if chlorine gas is detected above 3 parts per million.  There are emergency manual shut off stations located in two key loactions at the plant site.  The receiving vessel has built in safety features such as excess flow valves.  Most important feature of the accidental release preventation plan is operator training, chlorine handling procedures, and maintenance procedures.  Operator and maintenance mechanic training occurs regularly and when ever there is a change in the procedures.  Written chlorine handling and maintenance procedures are reviewed on a regular basis and revised if needed.  The Assistant District Manager is chairman of the committee responsible for developing and managing risk management and process safety programs.  The facility is in full compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  Since the events of September 11 the District employs a 24/7 armed guard of the chlorine facilities.  \n\nThe District is an active member with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The plant facilites are used"

The City of Charleston fire department is the local first responder for the facility and frequently tours the facility to remain familiar with the site and its operations.  \n\nThe District has under design a ultraviolet light system to replace the chlorine disinfection process.  Construction is scheduled to start last quarter of 2004 and complete mid 2005.  It is expected that the chlorine system will be off line by the third quarter of 2005."
