The                        \n    facility manufactures fiberglass building insulation which is sold in the commercial,                   \n    residential, and retail markets.  The facility currently encompasses approximately                      \n    610,000 square feet under roof and 170 acres of primarily wooded land.  There are                       \n    presently about 300 full time employees who operate the Plant 24 hours a day, 365 days a                \n    year.                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n    Johns Manville places a strong emphasis on safety and environmental leadership.  The                    \n    Company fosters a proactive philosophy to ensure that employees work in a safe                          \n    environment and that each facility remains in full compliance with all applicable federal,              \n    state, county and local regulations.  JM is also committed to environmental leadership                  \n    within the community served.  This commitment is exemplified in the Winder Facility\u0012s                   \n    strong recycling and waste minimization programs.  The Company\u0012s long term goal is to                   \n    have zero process wastes taken to disposal facilities, with all residual materials either               \n    recycled or used for beneficial purposes.  The Facility demonstrates another example of                 \n    its aggressive position on recycling through its use of 10% commerc"

The formaldehyde                          \n    containing resin solution is stored as a liquid in several storage tanks (ranging in size               \n    from 2,113 to 4,700 gallons maximum capacity) located inside the facility.  The resin                   \n    storage process is designed to minimize spills in the event of an accidental release.  The              \n    resin storage room is equipped with trenches that minimize the surface area of a spill.  In             \n    addition, the resin storage room is maintained at 50 degrees F to reduce the volatility of              \n    the material.  Although not a qualifying mitigation measure for the 112R program, low                   \n    storage temperatures give plant personnel adequate time to react to the situation by                    \n    reducing the volatilization rate of the resin material.  As a result of these factors, Johns            \n    Manville has not experienced an accidental release of formaldehyde over the entire life of              \n    the facility.

Under a worst-case scenario, a single vessel containing                    \n    4,700 gallons of liquid resin, which includes about 12.5% formaldehyde, is assumed to                   \n    spill with partial containment (low-lying pavement and trenches) in the resin room.                     \n    Liquid not contained in the resin room is assumed to spill outside via trenching and is                 \n    contained by an outdoor liquid capture pit.  Distance to the toxic endpoint of 12.0 mg/m3               \n    is calculated for Winder using AFTOX, a dispersion model that will determine toxic                      \n    chemical concentrations at hazard distances.  According to AFTOX, a worst-case resin                    \n    spill and subsequent formaldehyde vaporization onsite at Winder will result in a distance               \n    of 0.02 miles to the toxic endpoint.
