Facility accidential release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Feed Energy are committed to the prevention of any accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is storage. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used to nuetralize the water before it is sent to the treatment plant after the manufacturing of liquid feed. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3.  Accidental Reslease Prevention Program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety  Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" ,published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by the state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\n      A - There have been no accidental releases of anhyrdous ammonia that :\n            - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n            - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evactuations, shelter in place, property damage, or\n              enviromental damage.\n            \n\n5.  Emergency response Plan.\n\nThis facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 11"
