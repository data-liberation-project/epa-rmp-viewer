Therefore, Sulfur Dioxide is not regulated by 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Chlorine which may be stored at the SS - Pollution Control Plant is 8,000 pounds.  Chlorine is regulated by 40 CFR 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\nThe City of Siloam Springs certifies that they have had no reportable chemical release accidents withine the last five (5) years.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario considered is a full 2,000 pound container of chlorine released in 10 minutes.  The distance to worst-case toxic endpoint is 2.23 miles.  Calculations by RMP Comp with Mitigation  considered is that containers are in enclosed space in direct contact with outside air - shed w/1 side open.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered, is a full 2,000 pound cnotainer released through a broken 5/16 in container valve in 133 minutes.  The distance to alternative toxic endpoint is 0.20 miles.  Calculations by RMP Comp with Mitigation considered is that containers are in enclosed space in direct contact w/ outside air - shed w/1 side open.\n\nThere are public receptors:  Residencies, Schools, Hospitals, Prison/ Correctional Facilites, Recreation Areas and Major Commercial, Office, or Industrial Areas within the worst case toxic endpoint.  Therefore SS - Pollution Control Plant Program Level is Program 2.\n\nThere are public receptors:  Schools and Residences within the alternative release toxic endpoint.

The program addresses manangement, the adequacy of chlorination equipment and operator proficiency to eliminate or reduce such accidental chlorine releases.\n\nThe City of Siloam Springs - Pollution Control Plant is included in the written community emergency response plan - Benton County Office of Emergency Services Emergency Response Plan.  Therefore, SS - Pollution Control Plan emergency response plan is limited to their action plan to contact the Benton County Office of Emergency Services to initiate emergency response services.\n\nThe SS - Pollution Control Plant Emergency Response Coordinator is the Siloam Springs Public Works Director.  In his absense, the SS - Pollution Control Plant Superintendent will be in charge.  In the absense of both, the senior staff on premise will act as the Emergency Response Coordinator, (ERC) until the arrival of the SS - Pollution Control Plant Superintendent or the SS Public Works Director.  The ERC will coordinate responsibility and assist first responders upon their arrival.\n\nThe City of Siloam Springs hosted an informal meeting at the SS - Pollution Control Plant on June 3, 1999 of parties contributing to prevention program and which have responsibilites in implementation of the Emergency Response Program.  The following entities were represented at the meeting:\n\nBenton County Judge, Benton County LEPC, Oklahoma State Civil Emergency Mgmt.
