In the event of a liquid ammonia leak, the king\n\nvalves (outlet of the high pressure liquid receiver) can be closed manually or automatically to prevent flow of\n\nammonia liquid to downstream equipment. The system can be shutdown by the \n\n emergency stop stations located outside the engine room or through the computerized operator control system (remote access enabled).  In addition, ammonia sensors are located in the engine room.\n\n\n\nResponse Capabilities\n\nThe facility evacuates only and relies on the Albertville Fire Department and the ammonia contractor for response.\n\n\n\nAmmonia System Summary\n\nMajor equipment components include:\n\n?5 Compressors\n\n?13 Evaporators\n\n?3 Evaporative Condensers\n\n?1 Purger\n\n?1 Liquid Recirculators\n\n?2 Ammonia Pumps\n\n?1 High Pressure Liquid Receiver\n\n?1 Suction Accumulator\n\nAmmonia inventory: 16,076 lbs.\n\nAmmonia system operators: One and one assistant operator.\n\nAmmonia System Contractor: Southeastern Refrigeration, phone: 205-322-6587\n\nProcess Safety Management/Risk Management Program Description\n\nThe facility has a fully implemented process safety mana"
