Catalytic makes every effort to be in compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations. Therefore, Catalytic Innovations has prepared this RMP for its Ammoniating Process in accordance to 40 CFR 68 Subpart G, as the Ammoniating Process contains a stationary source holding a toxic substance in excess of the threshold quantity. The toxic substance held in Catalytic's Ammoniating Process is ammonia (anhydrous), which has a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. according to Table 1 of 40 CFR 68.130. \n\n1.1. 40 CFR 68.155(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source. \n\nIn order to prevent an accidental release of ammonia, Catalytic has implemented top engineering practices for the transfer of ammonia into the storage vessel and transfer from the storage vessels to the solutions to be ammoniated. The standard operating procedures for both the unloading tanker truck and the ammoniating process are available in print and digital forms for all employees involved in the covered process. In the case of an accidental release, Catalytic has in place a tiered emergency response plan in accordance with the severity of the release. The severity of the release is to be assessed by Catalytic's employees and the proper response is to then be followed according to the instructions laid out in the plan. \n\n1.2 40 CFR 68.155(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe stationary source in Catalytic's Ammoniating Process is two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks. The total storage capacity of the combined tanks is 24,00 gallons (123,600 lbs at 60 F). Tank #1 and #2 both have a storage capacity of 12,000 gallons (61,800 lbs at 60 F) each. Administrative controls are in place such that each tank is to be filled to a capacity no greater than 85%. This reduces the storage capacity of each ta"

The total storage capacity of both tanks with the limitation taken into account amounts to 20,400 gallons (105,060 lbs at 60 F). This total storage capacity surpasses the quantity threshold of 10,000 lbs according to Table 1 of 40 CFR 68.130. \n\n1.3 40 CFR 68.155(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. \n\nCatalytic Innovations' accidental release prevention program is built around the training of its employees and contract workers through observation and demonstration. Further prevention includes keeping the process and equipment restricted to approved employees, utilizing local exhaust ventilation, respiratory protection for employees under appropriate circumstances, maintaining the tank storage capacity at a safe level in accordance with the nature of Ammonia (Anhydrous), and regulating access to the ammonia storage tanks. Training in all pertinent standard operating procedures is given to all employees and contract workers before they are involved in the process. All personnel on site are given training in the emergency response plan whether directly involved in the covered process or not. Security measures are in place that keeps all tanks locked when un-attended. In the case of any suspicious activity, the Rolla Rural Fire Department and Police are notified and the site is secured by the police. Furthermore, Catalytic Innovations utilizes a PHA using HAZOP to address potential accidents or mechanical failures and how to appropriately address them to prevent an accidental release. The PHA addresses each part/node of the covered process to ensure mechanical integrity and proper execution of the SOP required to prevent accidental releases. \n\n1.4 40 CFR 68.155(d) The five year accident history\n\nCatalytic Innovations has had no previous accidents involving its Ammoniating Process. \n\n1.5 40 CFR 68.155(e) The emergency response program\n\nCatalytic Innovations has an"

The tiered emergency response program  includes the following:\n\n1) Tools for assessing the severity of the release based on the PPM range of the ammonia released from 0-25 PPM all the way to 1700 PPM. A range of 0 to 300 PPM initiates a TIER I response while a range above 300 PPM initiates a TIER II response. A release of ammonia over 300 PPM is considered a \"significant release\". \n\n3) A step-by-step responsive action plan for both a TIER I release and a TIER II significant release.\n\n4) Instructions for contacting the appropriate and corresponding local emergency departments and personnel when  TIER II response is initiated. These emergency contacts include Rolla Rural Fire/Rolla Police Dispatch who will then enter the premises and direct all response measures to the ammonia release. This includes instructions for keeping written records of these communications and reports. \n\n5) Instructions for reporting to the appropriate and corresponding agencies and departments including MDNR, MERC, LEPC, and the NRC according to the level of response required and initiated by the ammonia release. This includes instructions for keeping written records of these reports. \n\n1.6 40 CFR 68.155(f) Planned changes to improve safety\n\nAs Catalytic Innovations has had no previous accidents involving its Ammoniating Process, Catalytic intends to maintain the safety measures in place and currently has no planned changes to improve the process safety.
