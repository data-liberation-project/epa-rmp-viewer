      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe following Risk Management Plan has been prepared for the Wholesome Harvest Bakery facility located at 1955 Blue Hills Road NE in Roanoke, Virginia.  This facility is a commercial bakery, which operates two ammonia systems to cool bread products prior to distribution and chill glycol for cooling mixing equipment.  This program has been prepared pursuant to Part 68, Subpart G of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n\n\nThe system contains approximately 49,000 pounds of ammonia.  The maximum quantity of ammonia contained on site is approximately 49,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nTo prevent the accidental release of ammonia, Wholesome Harvest has developed the following: \n\n\n\n-     Maintenance procedures to ensure that equipment is properly maintained and functioning properly.\n\n-    Operating procedures to ensure that equipment is operated in a manner that minimizes the possibility of an ammonia release.\n\n-     Employee training to ensure that operators know how to properly use the equipment and non-operators are aware of the dangers of ammonia and the necessary steps to take in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nThe Standard Operating Procedure Program is contained in Binder 4: Standard Operating Procedures. Individual SOPs are contained within separate binders.\n\n\n\nThe general emergency response policy for the site when ammonia is released is to evacuate to an area upwind of the release and notify the appropriate personnel and authorities.  Trained personnel will then assess whether to evacuate the facility, and determine the appropriate level of response.  A copy of the Emergency Action Plan for Wholesome Harvest can be found in Binder 12.  \n\n\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\n\n\nAs explained above, Wholesome Harvest operates two ammonia cooling systems to cool and/or freeze bread products prior to shipment, and to chill glycol for onsite material mixing. \n\n\n\nIn order to reduce the "
