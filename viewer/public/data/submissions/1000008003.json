In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n\u00c2\u00bfAutomatic / Manual Shutdown\n\u00c2\u00bfWell Designed Relief System\n\nThe history of the Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 38 (i.e., no RMP-applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Injection System.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 38 to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for the NOx abatement system.

As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP"

Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 38 is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Berry Petroleum Cogeneration 38 staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia for controlling NOx emissions. \n\nBerry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 38 has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Injection System.  Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 38\u00c2\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nBerry Cogeneration Facility 38 is located in Kern County, California, approximately 3.2 miles southwest of the City of Taft and 3.2 miles northwest of the City of Maricopa. The facility is adjacent to the State Route 33 Highway, approximately one mile west of Route #33. The site occupies 1.8 acres. The site is adjacent to the Berry Petroleum Company Production Facilities. The area around the facility is basically uninhabited. \n\nBerry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 38 is owned by Berry Petroleum Company.  Steam and electricity are produced and sold to the local power utility company. The facility consists of a single Frame-VI General Electric Gas Turbine (rated capacity 38 MW), a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) including auxiliary duct burner rated at 300,000 pounds per hour of steam, and associated auxiliary and balance of plant systems.  Exhaust heat from the gas turbine is recovered in the heat recovery ste"

There are five personnel assigned to the facility - (1) Lead Technician and (4) Technician-II personnel.\n\nThe regulated substance managed at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum intended inventory is 54,720 lbs of anhydrous ammonia and it is stored in a pressurized horizontal storage tank at ambient temperature in liquid form.  When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a vaporizer is utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor. The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixing chamber where it is mixed with air. The resulting vapor ammonia / air stream is then injected into the HRSG. This, in conjunction with the catalyst within the HRSG, allow for the reduction of NOx and other unwanted materials being sent to the environment. The exhaust gas containing a lower concentration of NOx is then sent from the HRSG to an exhaust stack. \n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the ammonia injection system.
