(FC) accidental release prevention policy involves, but is not limited to technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the Iowa Fertilizer Law are adhered to.  The emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Respomse Program requirements.\n\n2.  The FC facility at Panther is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The location includes anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, nurse tank filling risers, electrical panels and lighting, and anhydrous ammonia safety equipment.\n\n3.

No accidental release of anhydrous ammonia have occured at this facility in the past five years.  This is a new ammonia storage site July 2009.\n\n5.  This facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Minburn Fire Department, which is a member of the Dallas County Emergency Management Agency in Iowa.  This program includes a response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency operations and response procedures are reviewed annually, with a site visit of the facility by the Minburn Fire Department.\n\n6.  Changes t"
