(AANA) is a manufacturer of feed grade L-lysine, L-threonine and L-Tryptophan. These compounds are amino acids used in pork, poultry and cattle feeds as well as pet foods to improve their nutritional content. The amino acids are manufactured using an industrial fermentation process. The primary raw material for the fermentation process is glucose, which is derived from corn. The amino acids are extracted, purified, and packaged for distribution throughout North America. Some product is exported to foreign countries. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia, which is covered under the EPA Risk Management Plan, is used at the Ajinomoto Animal Nutrition North America, Inc. facility. Ammonia is used for pH control and as a chemical component in the fermentation process and as a material for extraction in the purification process. \r\n\r\n**The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Our Facility**\r\nAjinomoto Animal Nutrition North America, Inc. is committed protecting our employees, the public, and the environment from the risks associated with the use of hazardous industrial chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nWe have taken steps to ensure that anhydrous ammonia is handled safely at our facility. Mechanical systems are inspected and tested to ensure safe and proper operations. Our employees are trained in the safe handling of ammonia. Approximately 75% of our employees have been trained to the HazMat Technician level, which allows quick response to any chemical release situation that may develop. \r\n\r\n**The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps**\r\nRegarding anhydrous ammonia, Ajinomoto Animal Nutrition North America, Inc. is regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP).
