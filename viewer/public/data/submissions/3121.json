The facility is owned by Cypress-Klein Utility District.  The Cypress-Klein Utility District Board of Directors has authority to make all policy and procedural decisions for the facility.  A contract operations company operates the facility.\n\nCypress-Klein WWTP utilizes chlorine, a toxic chemical, to disinfect treated plant effluent.  Chlorine is stored on site in 2,000-pound steel cylinders.  The chemical feed equipment is used to measure and apply the chemical to the treated effluent for disinfection.  There are no administrative controls or active mitigation systems in place at Cypress-Klein WWTP that would affect consideration of the release scenarios discussed below.\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Program, Cypress-Klein WWTP has established a prevention program to identify potential hazards and implement operational and maintenance procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental release.  The facilities used at Cypress-Klein WWTP are designed and constructed in accordance with applicable ANSI, ASTM, and ASME standards.  The prevention program includes annual hazard reviews, on-going safety training for personnel, daily equipment inspection and annual preventative maintenance.  A system has been established to investigate any hazardous incident related to the chemical storage and feed system.  Cypress-Klein WWTP has also established a compliance audit team to review the on-going prevention program and update the program as necessary to provide continued protection to the facility employees and the surrounding community.\n\nThe Cypress-Klein WWTP has not had any accidental releases of a regulated toxic substance that caused any on-site or offsite effects within the past five years.\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Program, Cypress-Klein WWTP has developed two scenarios to evaluate the possible effects of an accidental release and assist emer"

The \"worst-case scenario\" and the \"alternative release scenario\" were developed using the EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\"\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the facility is based on the release of an entire 2,000-pound cylinder of chlorine over a period of 10 minutes.  This scenario could have hazardous effects up to 1.3 miles downwind of the vessel.  Within 1.3 miles of the facility, there are homes, schools, businesses, recreation areas and day care centers that could be affected by the worst-case release.\n\nThe alternative scenario for a chlorine release is based on a 1/2-inch diameter rust hole on a chlorine storage vessel.  This scenario could have hazardous effects up to 0.4 miles downwind of the vessel.  \n\nThe Klein Community Volunteer Fire Department (VFD) is the local emergency responder responsible for handling an accidental chemical release at Cypress-Klein WWTP.  The emergency contact number for this agency is 911.  Cypress-Klein WWTP has coordinated and provided a copy of the Risk Management Program for the facility to the Klein Community VFD and the Harris County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for Unincorporated Areas."
