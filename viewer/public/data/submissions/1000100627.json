The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia. The facility utilizes an ammonia system to provide refrigeration for the production and storage of ice.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nArctic Glacier USA is a leading producer, marketer and distributor of high-quality packaged ice to consumers in Canada and the United States, primarily under the brand name of Arctic Glacier Premium Ice. Arctic Glacier operates 45 production plants and 49 distribution facilities across Canada and the northeastern, central and western United States servicing more than 75,000 retail accounts. \n\nArctic Glacier USA is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.

Arctic Glacier USA - Fremont's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Plant Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Arctic Glacier USA - Fremont facility is located at 43960 Fremont Blvd., in Fremont, California, at the intersection of Auto Mall Parkway and Fremont Boulevard, approximately 0.6 miles west of Freeway 680 and 1.0 mile east of Freeway 880. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.   \n\nThe primary business of Arctic Glacier USA - Fremont is the production and storage of ice. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the production and storage of ice.  Typical operating conditions range from 10 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 140 psig on the high side.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).
