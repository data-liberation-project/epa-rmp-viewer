This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident\nprevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design,\ninstallation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \nHowever, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and\ncontain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders\nproviding them with training and equipment so that  they can respond safety and\nefficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant, located 46 miles east of Rock Springs, Wyoming on\nInterstate 80, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g.,\nnatural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The Patrick Draw \nGas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated\nflammables. It processes approximately 120 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas\nand natural gas liquids.  The Patrick Draw Gas Plant does not use, process or store a\nreportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in\nprocesses at the gas plant is a vapor cloud (VCE) involving the full inventory of the\nlargest process vessel containing 248,793 pounds of  propane. The maximum distance\nto the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.5 miles.  No passive mitigation measures were\ntaken into account in evaluating"

Because processes at the Patrick Draw Gas Plant that are regulated\nby the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the\nOSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the\naccident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in\nall facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of\nemployee participation range from writing procedures and consequences of deviations, \nparticipating in process hazard analysis (PHA) reviews, incident investigations,\nemergency response drills, management of change committees and conducting\ninspections and testing on critical equipment.  Employees have access to all\ninformation created as part of the Patrick Draw Gas Plant accident prevention program. \nSpecific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are\ndocumented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Patrick Draw\nGas Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, The\nPatrick Draw Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process\nsafety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a safety program to\npromote both process and personal safety.  The program gives safety points for\nconducting monthly tool box meetings, fire equipment checks, vehicle checks,\nemergency response drills and participation in monthly safety meetings. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Pa"

Within this\nprogram, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that\nadequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant primarily uses the What If / Checklist (DP-10) analysis\ntechnique to perform these evaluations.  This analysis is recognized as one of the most\nsystematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted\nusing a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as\nengineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as\nwell as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for\nadditional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such\nmeasures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for\nresolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based\non a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that\npotential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All\napproved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are\ncompleted.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually\ndeviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Patrick Draw Gas\nPlant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic\nreviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency\nuntil the process is no longer operating.

These procedures are\nperiodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures\nare maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes\nmade through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Patrick Draw Gas\nPlant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in\noperating a process.  New employees receive initial training  on the Patrick Draw Gas\nPlant Process Overview and  plant fundamentals.  After successfully completing this\ntraining, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties\nand tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having\nadequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own,\nthey can work independently.

Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. \nThe audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Patrick Draw Gas Plant\nmanagement for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's\nfindings are traced until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is\ndocumented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nSummary of Process Hazards, Safety Features, and Hazard Analysis\nFindings\n\nThe processes at the Patrick Draw Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to\nensure continued safe operations.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP \n  covered processes at the Patrick Draw Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention\n  program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by\n  (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\n          Specialized Safety Features\n\n    The Patrick Draw Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1)\n  contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the\n  consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are\n  used in the covered processes:\n\n  Release Detection\n\n     1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in all closed compressor buildings\n\n  Release Containment/Control\n\n     1. Process relief valves that discharge to a vent system to handle episodic \n        releases\n\n     2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n     3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameter (e.g., high\n        level, high temperature)\n\n     4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n  \n  "

Emergency shutdowns strategically placed around the plant, that\n        automatically shuts in the inlet and outlet and blows the plant down through\n        the vent system.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to\nprotect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of\nprocedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the\npossibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The\nprocedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and\nmedical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after\nan evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a\nrelease occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures.  In\naddition the Patrick Draw Gas Plant has procedures that address maintenance,\ninspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that\naddress the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in\nthese procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. \nThe emergency response program is updated as necessary.  Any significant changes\nto the emergency response program are administered through the management of\nchange (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in\nthe changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Patrick Draw Plant is coordinated with\nthe Sweetwater County Fi"

This coordination includes periodic meetings with the LEPC, which includes\nlocal emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry\nrepresentatives.  The gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability with\nappropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire\ndepartment).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary,\nas well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC\nmeetings, the gas  plant conducts monthly  emergency drills. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAlthough Patrick Draw Gas Plant management does not believe additional safety\nmeasures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accident releases, it does\nresolve all findings from the Process Hazards Analysis and the Compliance Audits. \nSome of these findings result in modifications to the process.  The following types of\nchanges were implemented in response to PHA findings and the Compliance Audits:\n\n  1. Revision to personnel training programs.\n  2. Revision to operating procedures.\n  3. Revision to inspection procedures.\n  4. Modifications to the relief/vent system.\n  5. Modifications to the process instrumentation and control loops.\n  6. Updates to the Process Safety Information. (P&ID's)\n"
