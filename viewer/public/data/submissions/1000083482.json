Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, River Island Fresh has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 River Island Fresh, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that River Island Fresh has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name               |   Process Chemical     |   Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nNorth System Refrigeration |   Anhydrous Ammonia    |   12,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator feeds two/three bunker mounted evaporator coils located in the Precoolers and Storage Rooms. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid re"

      "SummaryText": "frigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator for Process 2. In Process 2, any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator or header, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the reciprocating/screw compressors.\n\n\n\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to an evaporative condenser where it is cooled and liquefied. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating.\n\n\n\nSafety Systems\n\n \n\nThe ammonia detection system was installed in accordance with ANSI/ASHRAE 15, ANSI/IIAR 2 and the Uniform Mechanical Code at the time of construction. If ammonia is detected in the cold rooms at concentrations above the alarm level of 25 ppm an audible alarm sounds. If ammonia is detected in the Machinery Room in concentrations above the alarm level of 50 ppm, an audible alarm sounds until it is manually reset.\n\n\n\nThe machinery rooms are equipped with a roof/wall-mounted ventilation fan.

Additionally, the P2 North System ventilation fan serves to control the temperature within the machinery room via a wall-mounted thermostat. \n\n\n\nEach Emergency Control Box (ECB) was installed in accordance with the Fire Code at the time of construction. The ECB is installed on the east wall of the machinery room and contains three (3) valves.\n\nValve #1: High Side Discharge Valve\n\nValve #2: Low Side Discharge Valve\n\nValve #3: High to Low Pressure Control Valve\n\nOpening Valve #1 will evacuate the process through the high pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #2 will evacuate the process through the low pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #3 will equalize the high and low pressure portions of the system. \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Control Box is seldom used in a refrigeration system, but has been installed for rare emergency situations.\n\n\n\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment.\n\n\n\nEach reciprocating compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment.\n\n\n\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with pressure relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing. The relief valves on the high side of each system relieve at 250 psig while the low side of each system relieves at 150 psig. All pressure relief valves are vented to atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation.
