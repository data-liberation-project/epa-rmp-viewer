Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at the Antelope Ridge Gas Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such a release were to occur, we are completely coordinated with Eunice Fire Department, which provides trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is the operation of a Natural Gas Processing Plant.  We have seven regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Pentane, and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-].  The regulated substances at our facility are components of the natural gas feed to the plant, the extracted liquid product, and the residue natural gas.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Methane at our facility is 42,000 lb while Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Pentane, and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-] are present at our facility in maximum quantities of 35,000 lb, 35,000 lb, 21,000 lb, 13,000 lb, 14,000 lb and 16,000 lb respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, we have used the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following pa"

      "SummaryText": "ragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic release from the \"Gas Plant and Associated Operations\" process.  The scenario involves the release of 73,012 lb of a flammable mixture that contains Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Pentane, and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-].  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.34 mile is obtained, corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from the \"Gas Plant and Associated Operations\" process.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 24,612 lb of a flammable mixture that contains Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Pentane, and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-].  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.16 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out in EPA's RMP (Risk Management Plan) regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  The Antelope Ridge Gas Plant is subject to OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).  We have also applied for an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Antelope Ridge Gas Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, op"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What If\" method.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA was performed on February 5, 1997.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Antelope Ridge Gas Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nAntelope Ridge Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every three years, and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Antelope Ridge Gas Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on January 27, 1999.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized"

The most recent review/revision of the management of change procedures was performed on December 10, 1998.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification.
