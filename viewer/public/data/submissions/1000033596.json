Plant personnel monitor the operation of the refrigeration system on a daily basis.  Periodic preventative maintenance procedures are performed on the refrigeration equipment, including inspecting and testing the equipment to ensure the mechanical integrity of the system.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release. Several staffing changes since the last update have occured.\r\n\r\nWhile it is Ducor Cold Storage's objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the Ducor Cold Storage facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established. Ducor Cold Storage employees will take defensive actions of mitigation that do not require entering a hazardous area.\r\n\r\nThe Ducor Cold Storage facility has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP regulations.  At least every three years, Ducor Cold Storage audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected. \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nThe Ducor Cold Storage facility is located at 5351 Road 236.  Ducor is the closest community to the Ducor Cold Storage facility.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides cooling for the Ducor Cold Storage facility.  The refrigeration system currently consists of two suction accumulators with liquid transfer systems, five compressors, two evaporative condensers, two h"

Bunker mounted accumulators are utilized to feed the flooded evaporators in the pre-cooler rooms and cold storage rooms.  \r\n\r\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the refrigeration system can be pumped down to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receivers.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the largest high pressure receiver is over 10,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations defines the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been implemented by the Ducor Cold Storage facility to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\n-Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\r\n\r\n-Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) have been completed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years. Recommendations are implemented in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n-Written operating procedures have been developed and will be reviewed at least annually.\r\n\r\n-Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility are implemented as needed.\r\n\r\n-Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\r\n\r\n-Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented"
