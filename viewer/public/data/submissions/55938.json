The Rodeo Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry, presence, and exit of support personnel, (2) a Lock/Tag/Try procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space is permitted.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery, as the employer, has a Contractor program with the objective of hiring competent and knowledgeable contractor employees to perform work safely on refinery processes.  This program applies to all contractor employees working in process areas.  The Contractor program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because it ensures that contractor employees are trained in and practice safe work practices.\n\nContractors must pass a qualification process prior to hire.  First, the Contractor must complete a pre-qualification package that covers their Worker's Compensation Experience Modification Rate, OSHA 300 Log, compliance with Title 8 CCR Section 3202 (Injury and Illness Prevention Program), drug and alcohol testing"

Examples of employee participation include safety committee involvement, developing and reviewing safe operating procedures, and participation in the process hazard analysis program.   Information on the refinery's prevention programs is available to employees, and they are encouraged to recommend improvements to any of the programs.  In addition, refinery management has a strong commitment to developing and enforcing written policies and procedures and encourages employee input to identify when a policy or procedure needs to be changed or improved to cover new tasks, revised regulations, or employee experience. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery maintains an extensive library of Process Safety Information.  This library includes information related to chemicals in the process, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.  These documents include detailed information on chemical properties and their associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design and configuration.

Each process is systematically examined using a technique known as process hazard analysis, or PHA.  A team of experienced operators, engineers, and other specialists conducts the analyses.  This team systematically identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as existing accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are then reviewed with management personnel for resolution.  Implementation of actions in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive the highest priority.  Actions implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe process hazard analysis for each process unit is updated and re-validated at least every five years.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, any team findings are reviewed with management personnel for resolution and any actions that result are tracked until they are completed.  \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery utilizes written procedures that address various phases of process operations including (1) initial startup of a newly constructed process, (2) unit startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) emergency shutdown."

Additionally, several refinery employees are certified emergency medical technicians.  Frequent training and participation in emergency response drills ensures the readiness of the response organization.\n\nThe emergency response program for the Rodeo Refinery is coordinated with Contra Costa Health Services, the Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District, the Crockett Carquinez Fire Protection District, and the Contra Costa County Office of Emergency Services.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  The Rodeo Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency responders.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident and facilitating a quick response.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nContinuous Improvement: The Rodeo Refinery continuously seeks and evaluates methods to improve the safety of its operations.  Recommendations from audits, incident investigations, process hazard analyses, or employee suggestions provide opportunities to enhance the safety of the refinery.

New employees must successfully complete up to six weeks of basic training on refinery operations before receiving their unit-specific training.  Basic training addresses applied sciences, job fundamentals, operating skills, and understanding basic refining processes.  The time necessary to successfully complete unit-specific training varies with the requirements of each job and the candidate's previous job experience.  It typically takes 8-24 weeks to qualify for a specific operating post.  Throughout the training process, candidates must continue to qualify by passing written and oral tests, thereby demonstrating understanding and retention of the training materials.  Qualification for all operating posts within a process area can take up to 3 years.\n\nRefresher training on operating procedures is provided to operating employees at least every three years, and refresher safety training is performed annually.  In addition, training emphasizing specific topics is performed as necessary (for example, furnace operation, dock operations, etc.).

Minor level incidents are investigated by an Area Supervisor using a causal factor approach to determine the cause of the incident.  Serious and major incidents are investigated by multidisciplinary teams using Root Cause Analysis methodology.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the event or a similar event.  Investigation findings and recommendations are documented and reviewed with management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and reviewed with workers who could be affected by the findings.  Any actions resulting from investigations are tracked until they are resolved.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future process hazard analyses.  \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the Process Safety Management and accidental release prevention programs are functioning properly, the Rodeo Refinery periodically conducts audits to verify that the procedures and practices required by the programs are being implemented as intended.
