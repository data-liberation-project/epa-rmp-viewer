As a result, these scenarios ignore prevention programs that are designed to limit the number and size of chemical releases from our facility.  A toxic worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to be damaged such that it released its entire contents within ten minutes without accounting for response measures that we would take to minimize the impact of such a release.  A flammable worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to suddenly disappear, the contents were to instantaneously vaporize, and a resulting vapor cloud were to ignite and explode.\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) represents a more likely event.  It is used to determine a reasonable outer bound for potential impacts in order to coordinate with local emergency responders.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has experienced one accidental release in the past 5 years that qualifies for reporting under the EPA's criteria.\n\nAn inadvertent opening of piping in the refinery flare and blowdown system released light hydrocarbons and Hydrogen Sulfide from the MP-30 Complex.  Odors were reported offsite and a precautionary shelter-in-place advisory was issued to the public.  No on- or off-site injuries were reported.  Inadequate isolation procedures were identified as the root cause of this incident.  The investigation from this incident resulted in corrective actions which have been implemented.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following summaries represent numerous prevention programs and practices at the Rodeo Refinery.

Each process is systematically examined using a technique known as process hazard analysis, or PHA.  A team of experienced operators, engineers, and other specialists conducts the analyses.  This team systematically identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as existing accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are then reviewed with management personnel for resolution.  Implementation of actions in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive the highest priority.  Actions implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe process hazard analysis for each process unit is updated and re-validated at least every five years.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, any team findings are reviewed with management personnel for resolution and any actions that result are tracked until they are completed.  \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery utilizes written procedures that address various phases of process operations including (1) initial startup of a newly constructed process, (2) unit startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) emergency shutdown.

New employees must successfully complete up to six weeks of basic training on refinery operations before receiving their unit-specific training.  Basic training addresses applied sciences, job fundamentals, operating skills, and understanding basic refining processes.  The time necessary to successfully complete unit-specific training varies with the requirements of each job and the candidate's previous job experience.  It typically takes 8-24 weeks to qualify for a specific operating post.  Throughout the training process, candidates must continue to qualify by passing written and oral tests, thereby demonstrating understanding and retention of the training materials.  Qualification for all operating posts within a process area can take up to 3 years.\n\nRefresher training on operating procedures is provided to operating employees at least every three years, and refresher safety training is performed annually.  In addition, training emphasizing specific topics is performed as necessary (for example, furnace operation, dock operations, etc.).  Prior to the commissioning of new or modified equipment, written operating procedures are developed and training is provided to affected operating personnel.
