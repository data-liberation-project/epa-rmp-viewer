The facility is also complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 CFR 1910.119. The UNFI - Mechanicsville, VA PSM/RM Program, along with other company safety and training programs, deals with the risks involved in the storage, handling, and processes utilizing hazardous chemicals. In this way, UNFI - Mechanicsville, VA promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, and avoid physical property and environmental damage.\n\n\n\nThe UNFI - Mechanicsville, VA safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release is considered a single process. \n\n\n\nThe UNFI - Mechanicsville, VA safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe process covered by the UNFI - Mechanicsville, VA PSM/RM Program is the ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for the refrigerated storage of perishable food products. The refrigeration process involves a typical vapor compression refrigeration cycle with compressors, condenser, and evaporators. The "

Liquid ammonia is circulated from the vessels in the refrigeration equipment room to the evaporator coils which cool the refrigerated spaces by boiling off some of the ammonia liquid to vapor. The ammonia then returns to the equipment room where the ammonia vapor enters the compressors and is discharged at higher pressure to the condenser. The vapor is cooled in the condenser causing the vapor to condense a to liquid which is drained to the receiver vessel to repeat the refrigeration cycle. \n\n\n\nA worst case scenario and alternative release scenario have been calculated for this facility and are included with the main body of the submittal.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the implementation of safety programs in compliance with the OSHA PSM Standard and the EPA RMP Program regulations, the UNFI - Mechanicsville, VA ammonia refrigeration system has been designed and constructed in accordance with applicable codes and standards. Standard operating procedures and training programs have been developed for the facility personnel to specifically address the characteristics of the UNFI - Mechanicsville, VA refrigeration system. \n\n\n\nThe UNFI - Mechanicsville, VA facility's emergency response program is based on OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEP and the fire department. \n\n\n\nThe UNFI - Mechanicsville, VA facility has a management system in place which has been developed to assure that the PSM/RMP Program is implemented, documente"

Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.\n\n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n    Employee Participation Program\n\n    Process Safety Information\n\n    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n    Operating Procedures\n\n    Training Program\n\n    Contractor Safety Program\n\n    Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\n    Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n    Hot Work Permit Procedures\n\n    Management of Change Procedures\n\n    Incident Investigation Procedures\n\n    Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\n\nD.
