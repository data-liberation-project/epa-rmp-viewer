The WPS Oxnard-area regional office and shop are both within 200 yards of the site. WPS supports HAZWOPER 1910.120 (q) and Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians (RETA) training for key Refrigerating Technicians and management personnel. These personnel are available to support Oxnard Fire/CUPA and the facility in the event of an emergency, and staff are on-call 24/7/365. Written procedures that include ammonia specific emergency pre-planning have been developed within the WPS Thirty Minute Plan. Ammonia-specific emergency equipment is maintained at the WPS Service Shop and in WPS Refrigerating Technician's service vehicles. The company strives to execute its accidental release prevention & emergency response policies through appropriately skilled employees that are provided with adequate equipment and training.\r\n\r\nA relationship with Oxnard Fire/CUPA has been established. Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated via regular site visits/inspections and submittal of appropriate EPCRA and other compliance reports.

Cal West Cooling is 100% owned by Western Precooling Systems but operations are separated:  Cal West Cooling manages pre-cooling and refrigerated storage and shipping of fresh produce; Western Precooling Systems supervises and maintains the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThe facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested fruits and vegetables. The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and short-term storage is on site generally for four days from harvesting. The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods picking up in the month of October and finishing in July. The remaining months see little fresh product, however the refrigeration equipment is still operative. Major maintenance is performed in the off-season. Operational maintenance is performed on a year-round basis. Company policy requires appropriately pre-qualified personnel to perform maintenance tasks.\r\n\r\nThe Regulated Substance in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a single closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system.  Refrigerating equipment consists of Compressor Units, Evaporative Condenser, Pressure Vessels, Room Evaporators, Portable HydroVac Vacuum Tubes, Pressure Coolers, Pumps, and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure safety relief valves. Pressure relief valves terminate at an Ammonia-Water Diffusion System which protects these valves from venting directly to atmosphere.  An automated refrigeration control, monitoring and alarm system automatically monitors the system. The Alarm System is supervised 24/7/365 by a third party alarm company which maintains pre-determined call lists and parameters.  Techni"

Some of the facility equipment is also portable and may be used in other areas depending on geographical & seasonal harvest demand.  Portable refrigerating equipment is common in the industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe design of the refrigeration system along with the implementation of the PSM Accidental Release Prevention Program is designed to provide assurance that the risks associated with the ammonia refrigerant are effectively managed. The elements of the PSM Program are intended to be integrated with the ongoing functions of the facility. The program is specifically intended to prevent an occurrence and minimize the consequences of an Anhydrous Ammonia release. In California the PSM program is in accordance with CCR 8, 5189\r\n\r\nWritten procedures have been developed for the daily operation of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release. The written procedures include necessary safety precautions and address each operating phase as defined by the Cal-ARP RMP/PSM Program. Refrigeration systems are only operated by pre-qualified personnel that are trained and qualified in the relevant operating and safety procedures. The Written Operating Procedures are maintained online & on-site and are regularly validated for accuracy.\r\n\r\nScheduled inspections and maintenance are executed by Western Precooling Systems (WPS) qualified technicians and/or pre-qualified specialty vendors.

Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow. If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated. The facility has installed these types of valves at each of the system's oil drain points.  Modifications have been made to the piping system to provide support in the event of seismic activity. Relief valves have been piped to water absorbing tanks (dispersion/diffusion). Relief valve excursions were another unwanted release potential and by routing to a secondary containment system the effects of a relief situation have been mitigated.\r\n\r\nModifications have been made to the piping system that provides more support to the piping in the event of seismic activity. WPS has also reduced on and offsite consequence potential by piping pressure relief valves to an Ammonia-Water Diffusion System. Relief valve excursions were identified as another common unwanted release situation and by routing to a secondary containment system the effects of an overpressure and relief situation should no longer affect people on or off-site.\r\n\r\nOther release prevention steps taken at WPS/CWC:\r\n- CWC has enclosed the facility with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility to increase the security of the facility from potential wrong-do-ers.\r\n- Per the PSM Program access to process areas is controlled by a sign-in/sign-out program\r\n- Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires,\r\nvandals, etc.  Training is documented through an online training system (WBBM). \r\n- A strong relationship exists with the Oxnard Fire D"
