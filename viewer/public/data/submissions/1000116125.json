This commitment is\ndemonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforseeably, if such a release does\noccur, we are completely coordinated with Buckhannon Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response\npersonnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility which is chlorine. The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is\n4,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-case Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including adminstrative controls and mitigation\nmeasures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided\nby the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen\nscenarios.\nToxic Worst-Case Analysis:\nThe Worst-Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from chlorination. The scenario involves the release of 2,000\npounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The release rate (lbs./min) is calculated to be 200. A distance to\nendpoint of 0.9 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 6,67 people within this distance.Toxic Alternativecase\nanalyses\nThe Alternative Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Chlorination. The scenario involves the release of 2.5 lb.\nof Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The Release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 0.25 and a Di"

Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections\nbriefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nWater Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating\nparameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Water Treatment Plant maintains written\noperating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations,\ntemporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nWater Treatment Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes\nare competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training\nin process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher\ntraining is provided as needed.\nMechanical Integrity\nWater Treatment Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.\nProcess equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, r"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification\nin process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular\npractice at Water Treatment Plant. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and\nmaintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\nCompliance Audits\nWater Treatment Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are\nbeing implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the\naudits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\nIncident Investigation\nWater Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic\nrelease of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well\nas any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.

Five-year Accident History\nWater Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  The plant's only incident of note occurred on July, 26, 2022. The incident resulted from a valve stem on the chlorine cylinder breaking upon initial testing and permitted a small release of chlorine.  The cylinder was originally delivered to the plant on July 6, 2022 by Phoenix Solutions, the supplier.  All reports will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n6.
