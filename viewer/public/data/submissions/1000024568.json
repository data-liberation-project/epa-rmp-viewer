This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Winona propane terminal located in Coconino County, Arizona is owned by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC, and is operated by Enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe Winona Propane terminal facility is a bulk hydrocarbon storage and handling facility.  The facility receives odorized propane LPG by rail car and stores the liquid in one of three above ground pressurized storage tanks.   A propane vapor compressor is used to provide pressurized vapors into the vapor space for the unloading of rail cars spotted on the facility rail siding.  The same compressor is subsequently used to remove vapors from the empty cars prior to their disconnection from the tank fill piping and railcar unloading racks.  Odorized propane stored in the three above-ground propane storage bullets is transferred to 18-wheel propane tanker trucks through the use of a small liquid propane pump.  The terminal operator is responsible for the hookup, unloading and disconnection of supply rail cars.  The operator also assists with the proper tare weighing, loading and full weighing of transport trucks that fill up at the terminal, and with coordinating the removal of empty rail cars and the delivery of full cars as the propane "

Within this program, the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The results of any previous process hazard analyses conducted by the previous owner are not available at the terminal.  \n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Winona propane terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to propane terminal facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Winona propane terminal ha"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Winona Propane terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Winona Propane Terminal has safety features on the facilty equipment to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high flow).\n\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., excess flow shutdown, backed up by a technician activated ESD system.). \n\n* Atmospheric manual vents and automatic relief devices.\n\n* An operator initiated emergency shutdown system \n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers \n\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, hard hats, flame retardent coveralls, safety glasses, etc.)\n\n*An automtic loading fire detection and shutdown system.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Winona Propane terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past five years there have been no large or small releases with injuries or offsite consequences.  \n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\n\n\nThe Winona propane terminal currently utilizes a set of written emergency procedures, which are in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for th"

The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in the emergency procedures, and they are updated when necessary based on modifications made to the propane terminal facility.\n\n \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for Winona propane terminal is coordinated with the Coconino County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination will include periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Winona propane terminal will institute any necessary around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials similar to those already in place for contacting the local fire department.  This will provide a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to the planned periodic LEPC meetings, the Winona propane terminal conducts periodic reviews of emergency procedures with the fire department emergency response organization.  The Winona propane terminal facility also currently holds periodic meetings with  local emergency responders regarding the hazards of the regulated substances handled by the propane terminal facility and the location of emergency shutoffs and equipment.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Winona Propane terminal facility resolves all findings from PHA's, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Changes are usually planned in response to PHA's, safety audits and incident investigation findings.  The following change to improve the safety at the location is planned for implementation in the near future, prior to the conduct of the PHA revalidation.\n\n\n\n*  Enterprise is in the process of reviewing the entire 14-issue safety management/accident prevention program to e"
