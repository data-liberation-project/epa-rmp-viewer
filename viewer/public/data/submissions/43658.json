AE LLC has in place a number of plans for responding to emergency situations.  These plans are described in this RMP Public Document.\n\nThe facility?s emergency response-related program efforts are highlighted in several documents, e.g., the Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP), Hazardous Substance Control Plan, and Emergency Action Plan. The HMBP describes the emergency response procedures in place in the event of a release of a regulated substance, such as anhydrous ammonia. A contact list of outside response organizations that would be called upon to provide assistance in the event of a fire or chemical release incident, such as fire-fighting, security and public notification. Elements of the HMBP also include a description of the following: alarm system activation and signal interpretation; safe evacuation, assembly locations and return to the facility; selection of response strategies based on type of incident; incident command structure and emergency contact list; list of response equipment onsite and authorized use of equipment by employees; release mitigation activities and measures in place; post-release equipment cleanup and decontamination procedures, and personnel decontamination.\n\nA ?Chain-of-Command? for emergency response is in place, with the Site Manager or Emergency Coordinator (EC) (or the designee in the absence of the EC) as the lead.

The FFD is responsible for securing the site and may delegate perimeter security and specific response actions to other base agencies, such as the base military police and the County?s Hazardous Materials team. \n\n1.2    Description of Regulated Process\n\nThe cogeneration facility is located within Marine Corps property.  The cogeneration facility provides steam to the Navy and electricity to the electric utility company, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).  The major system components are a gas turbine generator, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), a steam turbine generator, and associated equipment and control systems.  The facility began commercial operations in 1989.\n\nAE LLC uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3) to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from the gas turbine exhaust at the cogeneration facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a vertically mounted tank.  The maximum capacity of the tank is 4,000 gallons. The tank contents are limited to a maximum of 3,400 gallons.  Annual consumption of ammonia is approximately 19,200 gallons.\n\n1.3    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs a facility constructed and operated to provide steam to the U.S. government and electricity to SDG&E, AE LLC?s cogeneration facility is vital to national security and must be operated safely and efficiently. \n\nThe facility maintains, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), its Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, which provides for the identification, prevention and minimization of chemical releases that could result from failures in processes, procedures and equipment.  The major safety systems in place at the facility include process safety equipment and administrative safety procedures.

AE LLC?s process safety equipment includes a number of redundant systems, made up of local and remote indicators, sensors, and alarms that monitor operating levels, pressures and temperatures, and relay information to the facility Control Room Operator through an automated Distribution Control System. \n\nThe ammonia handling process includes relief, isolation and vent valves that can provide a margin of safety in the event of deviations from normal conditions, by allowing the operator to identify and isolate the problem and either return the system to normal conditions, or safely shut down the process.  The ammonia storage tank has a deluge system, which, in the event of a major leak or release, will activate high pressure water nozzles around the tank to quench the ammonia that is released.\n\nA number of administrative safety procedures complement the process safety equipment at the AE LLC facility.  These include written standard operating procedures (SOP) for all processes; twice-daily shift walkdown inspections of all major equipment, valves and alarms; extensive use of procedures checklists, such as for ammonia tank loading; and an automated preventative maintenance system for tracking daily repair work orders and scheduled maintenance operations. \n\nAn operator training program encompassing operating procedures, safety and health, and emergency response with a biennial re-qualification requirement, helps ensure that employees think, act, and work safely while on the job.\n\nIn addition to the OSHA PSM, the AE LLC facility holds federal and state emergency response and safety plans, including the Hazardous Substance Contingency Plan (HSCP), Emergency Action Plan (EAP), Fire Prevention Plan (FPP), Exposure Control Plan (ECP), Injury and Illness Prevention Plan (IIPP), Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC), H"

One accidental release was not of a reportable quantity.  The other accidental release was a reportable quantity of approximately 570 pounds.  No one offsite was injured. The Federal Fire Department (FFD), as a precautionary measure, initiated evacuation of the facility.  Two FFD responders underwent medical treatment as a precautionary measure.\n\n1.5    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSince the 1999 RMP effort, as part of the process safety features, solenoid-actuated valves were installed.  Installation of these valves and updates of operating procedures were completed by April 2003. Other than the addition of these valves (and related process/SOP updates) and replacement of equipment, the facility has not undergone any significant changes in its process, SOPs, maintenance system, training program, or equipment.\n\nRecommendations made as part of the review for the 1999 RMP/CalARP, and the subsequent triennial audit conducted in 2002 were implemented, unless otherwise indicated. Recommendations from the 2004 RMP/CalARP update and resubmittal will be implemented by January 1, 2005, unless otherwise indicated. These are: \n\n1)    Obtain the updated the Site map to reflect removal of Cabrillo Power?s gas turbines, and associated equipment and structures, as well as sewer inlet for water tank.\n\n2)    Make a list of operating procedures with review/revision date and reviewer?s name; place inside SOP manual.\n\n3)    Update HMBP, PSM, EAP, and SPCC to reflect changes in the facility, including replacement of halon system with CO2; keep records of revisions with the name and signature of reviewer, date, and text of changes in each plan.\n\n4)    Complete Management of Change procedures to document addition"

For purposes of this update and resubmittal, the previous references to AEI are replaced by AE LLC in this document.\n\n\n\nAs required by the federal EPA, this executive summary has been submitted to the EPA under the filename ?NTC_EXEC? as a text document.  This RMP Public Document presents the efforts of AE LLC to manage and prevent risks associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at its cogeneration facility located at the Naval Training Center (NTC) located in the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in the City and County of San Diego, California. \n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policy\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of AE LLC to protect the health and safety of its employees, officers, and the general public.  It is the firm policy of AE LLC to fully and faithfully comply with all requirements, both substantive and reporting, of all environmental, health, and safety statues, regulations, ordinances, and permits affecting the operations and maintenance of our plants.  AE LLC has in place a number of plans for responding to emergency situations.  These plans are described in this RMP Public Document.\n\n\n\nThe facility?s emergency response-related program efforts are highlighted in several documents, e.g., the Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP), Hazardous Substance Control Plan, and Emergency Action Plan. The HMBP describes the emergency response procedures in place in the event of a release of a regulated substance, such as anhydrous ammonia. A contact list of outside response organizations that would be called upon to provide assistance in the event of a fire or chemical release incident, such as fire-fighting, security and public notification. Elements of the HMBP also include a description of the following: alarm system activation and signal interpretation; safe evacuation, assembly locations and return to the facility; selection of response strategies based on type of incident; incident command stru"

Once initial action to determine the nature and extent of the release and appropriate internal notifications have been made, the EC or designee will make a decision to notify outside emergency response agencies.  The Federal Fire Department (FFD) located on the base is the primary response agency on federal property and becomes the onsite incident commander in the event of a fire or offsite chemical release.  The FFD is responsible for securing the site and may delegate perimeter security and specific response actions to other base agencies, such as the base military police and the County?s Hazardous Materials team. \n\n\n\n1.2 Description of Regulated Process\n\n\n\nThe cogeneration facility is located within Marine Corps property.  The cogeneration facility provides steam to the Navy and electricity to the electric utility company, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).  The major system components are a gas turbine generator, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), a steam turbine generator, and associated equipment and control systems.  The facility began commercial operations in 1989.\n\n\n\nAE LLC uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3) to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from the gas turbine exhaust at the cogeneration facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a vertically mounted tank.  The maximum capacity of the tank is 4,000 gallons. The tank contents are limited to a maximum of 3,400 gallons.  Annual consumption of ammonia is approximately 19,200 gallons.\n\n\n\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nAs a facility constructed and operated to prov"

The major safety systems in place at the facility include process safety equipment and administrative safety procedures.  The Year 2000 (Y2K) plan was implemented.\n\n\n\nProcess safety equipment means that the facility is designed and built according to accepted safety codes and standards for electrical, mechanical, and structural integrity.  AE LLC?s process safety equipment includes a number of redundant systems, made up of local and remote indicators, sensors, and alarms that monitor operating levels, pressures and temperatures, and relay information to the facility Control Room Operator through an automated Distribution Control System. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia handling process includes relief, isolation and vent valves that can provide a margin of safety in the event of deviations from normal conditions, by allowing the operator to identify and isolate the problem and either return the system to normal conditions, or safely shut down the process.  The ammonia storage tank has a deluge system, which, in the event of a major leak or release, will activate high pressure water nozzles around the tank to quench the ammonia that is released.\n\n\n\nA number of administrative safety procedures complement the process safety equipment at the AE LLC facility.  These include written standard operating procedures (SOP) for all processes; twice-daily shift walkdown inspections of all major equipment, valves and alarms; extensive use of procedures checklists, such as for ammonia tank loading; and an automated preventative mainte"

One accidental release was not of a reportable quantity.  The other accidental release was a reportable quantity of approximately 570 pounds.  No one offsite was injured. The Federal Fire Department (FFD), as a precautionary measure, initiated evacuation of the facility.  Two FFD responders underwent medical treatment as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n\n1.5 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSince the 1999 RMP effort, as part of the process safety features, solenoid-actuated valves were installed.  Installation of these valves and updates of operating procedures were completed by April 2003. Other than the addition of these valves (and related process/SOP updates) and replacement of equipment, the facility has not undergone any significant changes in its process, SOPs, maintenance system, training program, or equipment.\n\n\n\nRecommendations made as part of the review for the 1999 RMP/CalARP, and the subsequent triennial audit conducted in 2002 were implemented, unless otherwise indicated.
