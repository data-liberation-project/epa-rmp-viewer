As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112? Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Iowa Ethanol (DBA POET Biorefining - Hanlontown) completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nIowa Ethanol (DBA POET Biorefining - Hanlontown) is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.   The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Iowa Ethanol (DBA POET Biorefining - Hanlontown) to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of denaturant, it is the policy of Iowa Ethanol (DBA POET Biorefining - Hanlontown) to notify the Worth County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain approximately 24-30 percent pentane (we used 30 percent for reporting), an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 1941840 pounds (total pentane is 582,200 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a se"

Iowa Ethanol (DBA POET Biorefining - Hanlontown) has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenario as it related to this reportable substance.  Emergency response program for this scenario has been prepared and implemented.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, Iowa Ethanol (DBA POET Biorefining - Hanlontown) has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nIowa Ethanol (DBA POET Biorefining - Hanlontown) does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.  This facility has been operational since March 2004."
