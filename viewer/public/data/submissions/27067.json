The owner/operator and employees of Feekes Farm Supply, Peterson, IA. are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia. In the event of a accidental release, the facility and employees are prepared to work with authorities to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION.\nA. The primary activity at the facility regarding anhydrous ammonia is to store the product and sell it to farmers for application on crops as a fertilizer nutrient.\nB. The maximum quantity stored would be approximately100,682 pounds of which 79000 pounds, in a 18000 gallon storage tank, which represents the tank volume at 85% capacity. The remaining 21,887 pounds is stored in nurse tanks. \n\nIII. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO'S\nA. The worst case scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank over a ten minute period. The maximum quantity released would be approximately 79000 pounds. The toxic endpoint would be approximately .83 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario is based on a release from a transfer hose. The quantity released would be 26000 pounds. The toxic endpoint would be approximately .59 miles.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\nA. The facility has a Contingency Plan in place to deal with any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nV. THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\nA. There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia that has caused any deaths, injuries or any environmental damage.\n\nVI. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\nA. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions and evaluate employee training. There are no specific Anhydrous Ammonia safety recomendations at this time."
