      "SummaryText": "\nChlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  DWP prepared and submitted the RMP for the Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station facility in June 1999.  This RMP is the five year update of the June 1999 RMP.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.* \n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n        "

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe DWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station is located at 2460 Holly Drive, Hollywood, California.  The chlorination station is located adjacent to the reservoir, off Holly Drive, east of the Hollywood Freeway. The facility serves to chlorinate Hollywood Reservoir water. After disinfection, water from the station is distributed for domestic and industrial consumption in the Hollywood area. The station consists of a chlorinator room, a chlorine storage room, an instrument room, pump room, and a two-ton capacity chlorine scrubb"

A maximum of four one-ton chlorine containers is stored at the Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet station.  These containers are connected to the chlorination process to feed liquid and gaseous chlorine.  The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Lower Hollywood Reservoir Outlet facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nIn normal operation, two chlorine 1-ton containers are manifolded together into a liquid header that connects to the evaporators.  These containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and feed liquid chlorine under pressure.  The actuators will close the angle valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  Two additional ton containers with actuators are connected through a gas supply header.  They bypass the evaporators, serving as an automatic backup when the primary containers run dry or the evaporator shuts down due to a low temperature condition. \n\nThe liquid chlorine passes from the containers through the evaporators where it is vaporized in a water bath.  The gaseous chlorine then proceeds to a vacuum regulator/check unit, where the gas goes from positive pressure to a vacuum. The gas then continues to one of the three chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  From there, gas is pulled by vacuum to either baseme"

The solution is then piped into the reservoir or reservoir outlet pipelines.\n\nA motorized shutoff valve is provided to stop chlorine flow to Chlorinator No. 2 when water flow in the Upper Hollywood Reservoir outlet pipeline reverses flow direction. This closes off the supply of chlorine to the chlorinator when chlorination is not needed.\n\nResidual chlorine analyzers monitor residual chlorine downstream of the diffusers and provide feedback control for subsequent dosing.\n\nChlorine leak detectors are provided to detect chlorine leaks in the chlorine room and the chlorinator room.  When a chlorine leak is detected, the detector signal activates a local audible and visual alarm as well as an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.\n\nThe station has installed a caustic solution scrubber actuated by chlorine detectors at a concentration of 3 ppm which can neutralize up to 4,000 lb of chlorine in case of a chlorine leak.\n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorine facilities, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Loss of power will cause the backup generator to take over powering all station functions.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.\n\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily when the station is in service.  A response team coordinated from DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms which may occur.
