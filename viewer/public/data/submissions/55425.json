We carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of new discoveries and technologies in dialogue with scientists and society before deciding on how to proceed.\n?    We pursue an open dialogue with all relevant opinion leaders in society.  Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation, Wyandotte Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n \nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Wyandotte Site uses the following RMP regulated substances ? ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, toluene di-isocyanate, and aqueous ammonium hydroxide.  These chemicals are used to manufacture Polyols, urethane products, and styrene-acrylic polymers.  These products are used in the manufacture of automotive components, automotive seats, carpet padding, toys, home insulation, inks, coatings, and other consumer products.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the American Chemistry Council?s Responsible Care Process Safety and Security Codes. \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility had no accidental releases over the past five years that meet the reporting criteria.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response plan has been prepared, outlining individual actions that would be required by each level of worker in the event of a chemical release or fire. It is coordinated with the plan that exists within the Local Emergency Planning Committee at Metro Airport, and it is tested annually during the site-wide drill. A community alert broadcast system is in place, ?Sammy the Siren?, which would be used to warn local residents to either `shelter in place? or evacuate the area in the event of a release. The siren is tested once per month, and detailed shelter in place information was provided "

      "SummaryText": "to local residents. \n\nEach operations employee receives an annual awareness level training in emergency response. Employees in the units using RMP chemicals receive HAZWOPER technician level training.  This training outlines what individual actions would be required in the event of a release to stop or significantly reduce the potential for off-site exposure to a chemical release. The site also has several members of a highly trained response team, called the TRACER team, and will be available to assist both on-site and off-site emergencies involving the accidental release of chemicals.\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  HAZMAT team members are trained and participate in drills annually.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses and incident investigations."
