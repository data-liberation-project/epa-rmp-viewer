The entire contents of the chlorine process piping system would be released due to failure of a flange gasket just outside of the vaporizer building amounting to a quantity of 667 pounds.  This flange is approximately 200 feet from the closest chlorine monitor; therefore, it is assumed that it would take an employee 5 minutes to notice the leak and an additional 3 minutes to close the emergency shut-off valve on the chlorine car.  Then, the emergency alarm would be manually activated and the response team would be on the scene with-in approximately 20 minutes from the time that the manual alarm is pulled.  This scenario assumes that the entire pipeline contents would be released prior to the response team arrival on site, but if the rate of release is slower than 24 lb./min., the remaining chlorine in the pipeline could be neutralized by venting to the V-C-17 scrubber.  8522 public receptors would potentially be impacted within the 0.98 mile distance that the toxic plum could travel.  Local businesses and neighbors would be notified to shelter-in-place by calling the 911 emergency response network within 10 minutes of the start of the release.        \n\n\n\n2) CHLOROFORM\nThis scenario assumes a leak in the piping extending from the chloroform storage tank to the Terrazole (R) crop protection chemical sub-process called 2422.  The leak would be active for the entire 30 minutes of the daily transfer of chloroform from storage to the process.  It would not be detected until the operator performs his routine line walk-down as required by plant operation policy.  The operator would alert the in-house emergency response team by sounding the plant-wide alarm.   Loca"

The emergency response team will arrive on the scene within 15 minutes and it will take an additional 15 minutes to control and clean up the spill.  105 pounds of chloroform would be release in this scenario.  The resulting toxic plum could reach 30 public receptors within a 0.090 mile radius from the process site. \n\n\n\n3) PCMM\n0.2 pounds of perchloromethyl mercaptan (PCMM) would be released within a 5 minute period in this scenario.  The leak would be incurred while unloading the bulk tank truck to the bulk storage tank.  Since this operation is always attended by an operator, it would be detected and stopped within 5 minutes.  Although this chemical has a very low volatility, it can pose a serious health hazard due to it's low OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 ppm.  Therefore, the unloading operator would notify the response team to mitigate the spill by manually activating the emergency alarm system.  Local businesses and neighbors would be notified to shelter-in-place by calling the 911 emergency response network within 10 minutes of the start of the release.  13 public receptors could potentially be impacted within 0.06 miles distance of the release.\n\nMitigation measures:\n- Safety and Emergency Response Drills\n- Activation of Monroe County Emergency Action Plan\n- Prompt Notification To Citizens (Including What Action To Take, e.g. shelter-in-place, Evacuation, etc.)\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

ROCHESTER RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Arch Rochester, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces biocides, and custom chemical products.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nOur worst -case release scenario for toxic chemicals involves a catastrophic rupture of a chlorine railcar within the plant property. The required assumption is that the entire contents(180,000 lbs.) of chlorine would be released to the air within 10 minutes. The assumed weather conditions are:wind speed, 1.5 m/sec; temperature, 25 degrees centigrade; and relative humidity, 50%.\nUnder the above stipulated weather conditions, the chlorine could travel 25 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public. Within this release area, there would be potential exposure to schools, homes, businesses, shopping malls, nursing homes, parks and recreational areas. To ensure that a scenario of this type never occurs, the following safety measures are taken:\n-Substantial construction of chlorine cars\n-Regular"

Some additional key improvements that the facility is committed to implementing are:\n>  Improve the chlorine sensor design for increased reliability.\n>  Upgrade the chloroform tank vent.\n>  Investigate the potential for chloroform leakage into the plant condensate \nreturn systems and take appropriate measures to alarm potential \nhazardous situations.\n>  Improve the product pack-out station to reduce the potential for chloroform\nspills.\n>  Improve the PCMM process pressure control.\n>  Improve the PCMM critical safety device preventive maintenance system.  \n\nThe corporation has begun implementing a Goal Is Zero Initiative: zero injuries; zero environmental releases; zero community complaints. In order to be successful, we are focusing on the following areas:\n- Implement preventative action processes, including predictive measures.\n- Initiate a behavioral based safety process, which includes employee observations and focuses on decreasing at-risk employee behavior and injuries.\n- Attain PSM compliance for all processes (even those not required by the regulation).\n\n\nCERTIFICATIONS\n\nWithin the past five years, the processes have had no accidental release that caused off-site impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).
