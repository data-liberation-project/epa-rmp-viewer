      "SummaryText": "1.0 SOURCE\nThe Quality Chef Foods, C Street Facility ( C Street facility) in Cedar Rapids, Iowa is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemacal Release regulations (40 CRF 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for processing and freezing food products.  The entire system contains approximately 47,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessle is a controlled pressure receiver that operates at approximately 80 psig and can contain as much as 31,000 pounds of liquid ammonia, assuming a 90 percent fill volume.  However during physical operation the vessel holds only 11,000 pounds.\n2.0 POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nAs required by the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative-case release) were analyed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the ammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  The release scenarios are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Model risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (the Model Plan), dated May 1996.\n2.1 Worst-case Release\nThe worst-case release is defined as the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of contents of the largest vessel and associated piping (aproximately 47,000 pounds of ammonia) over a 10 minute period.  Using the specified worst case meteorology contained in the Model Plan and assuming the facility is located in a rural area, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release extends beyond the facility\nboundary.\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be concidered a highly unlikely event.

If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with dual safety relief valves (SRV's) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRV's continue to function.  Actuation of the SRV's would result in an ammonia release simlar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternativerelease scenario.\nThe worst cse release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\nThe facility has training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualifyed personnel;\nThe facility has emergency responce procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases.\n2.2 Alternative case Release\nThe alternative case release scenario is defined as a release of ammonia that is more likely to occurthan the worst case scenario, and reaches an endpoint offsite.\nThe Model Plan scenario was used for the analysis, which assumes a release of ammonia through a 1/4- inch effective diameter hole in a high side (i.e.150 psig) pipe or vessel, releasing 100 pounds of ammonia per minute.  Using the specified meterology contained in the Model Plan the distance to the endpoint for the more likely release scenario extends beyond the facility boundary.\nThe alternative case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\nIndustrial standards were followed for the manufacture and the quality controls of these lines.\nThe facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualifie"

To help minimize the probability and severityof an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the program are summarized below:\nThe development of an employee participation program, which includes C Street facility employees from all areas within the plant.\nThe development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\nThe performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration systemusing a\nWhat If Protection Analysis.\nA team with expertise in engineering, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA is updated and validated every five years.\nStandard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The (SOPs) include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\nRefrigeration system maintenance"

The training is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.\nContractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are  pre-qualified based on thier knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  In addition, these contractors are periodically evaluated to ensure that they continue to work safely.  A formal preventative maintenance program is in the process of being fully developed and deployed.  This will include regular inspection of powered equipment, including compressors, pumps, fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc.,for vibration or incipient mechanical failure, and regular inspectionand calibration of liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches, and shutdown devices that have safety implications.\nFormal athorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original designand that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\nEvents that might cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subject to a formal investigation.  The object of the investigation is to correct the deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\nPrior to the preformance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work athorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\nPlanning with the local fire department occurs often to ensure a rapid response to potential incidents with the system or external events, such as floods or tornadoes.\nPevention program compliance audits ar"
