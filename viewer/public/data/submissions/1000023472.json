It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the City of Vernon Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We also instruct employees on proper evacuation procedures in case of emergencies.\n\nA description of the facility processes and regulated substance stored. This facility provides a broad range of specialty chemical services, products, and custom blending, and custom formulation, all related to aerosol can filling and pressurizing.  The propane and butane LP blends are used as propellant for the aerosol can pressurizing process. The tank farm consists of six 1,999 gallon aboveground storage tanks (AST). Not all six ASTs contain propane or butane, other gasses are stored below the reporting threshold limit.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario: Our worst case scenario is the failure and complete release of one 1,999 gallon AST, filled to a maximum level of 88% capacity which would be 7487 pounds of LP gas containing propane and butane. The resulting release has the potential of a Vapor Cloud Explosion. The facility is located in an area that is only industrial/commercial buildings and businesses.  There are no residential areas within the .2 miles radius endpoint.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario: Our alternate release scenario is the opening or failure of a pressure release valve on a 2\" pipe, with the longest distance of 21' long. The resulting release is a 10 minutes release and explosion.\n\nThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and chemical specific prevention steps. This facility complies with EPA's accidental prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicable federal, state and local codes, and regulations. The propane storage and delivery system is designed, installed, and maintained in accord"

There have been no accidents involving propane release that would result in death, injury, evacuation, property or environmental damage from this facility.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program. In the event of an emergency involving our LP gasses it is our policy to notify the City of Vernon Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. There is a water deluge system that is in place that is activated by sensors from within the walls of the tank farm containment area. The employees at this facility are also trained how to complete an emergency shut down of the LP system. We have coordinated our response plan with the City of Vernon Fire Department and they have inspected our propane system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety. None at this  time. All safety procedures were designed into the system at the time the system was installed. The system has sensors within the walls on the tank farm containment area. These sensors would automatically set off the water deluge system and shut off all valves on tank and transfer system.\n"
