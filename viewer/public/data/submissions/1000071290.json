The terminal is a petroleum products transfer facility, which began operation in 1966. The facility has pipeline, truck transfer, and storage areas.\n\n\n\nChevron Products Company has a butane blending process at the terminal to inject butane into its gasoline immediately prior to truck loading of various gasoline products.  The terminal receives butane via tanker trucks and stores the butane in two 90,000-gallon pressurized horizontal butane storage bullets.  The butane blending operation and associated butane storage render the terminal subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements.  Moreover, this operation renders the terminal subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR ?1910.119.  The facility also stores other flammable substances in pressurized spheres which are covered under the OSHA PSM standard.  As such, the terminal is subject to RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nChevron and the terminal have a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety, which is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe two 90,000-gallon storage vessels at the facility carry a flammable mixture consisting of n"

The flammable mixture possesses physical characteristics of a NFPA No. 4 flammable material and the weight percentages of each constituent vary; therefore, for modeling purposes, it is assumed that the entire weight of the flammable mixture is normal butane.  It should be noted that an analysis was also performed using the other constituents in the flammable mixture but the resulting endpoint distance was no greater using any of these constituents either as the entire weight of the flammable mixture or in varying percentages.  Because the two storage vessels are located in close proximity to one another, they are considered to be \"co-located\" and the catastrophic rupture of both storage vessels is considered to be the worst-case release scenario. The facility utilizes administrative controls to not allow the vessels to be filled beyond eighty (80) percent capacity; therefore, the storage volume of each vessel is 72,000 gallons.  In addition, according to the process safety information an estimated 1,611 gallons of the flammable mixture may be contained in process piping and associated appurtenances, and this quantity is also included in the worst-case release scenario as these may rupture in the event of a catastrophic release.  Therefore, the maximum storage capacity of this flammable mixture in the two 90,000-gallon storage vessels, process piping, and associated appurtenances for the worst-case flammable release scenario taking into account administrative controls is estimated at 716,493.5 pounds (145,611 gallons), assuming a specific gravity of 0.59 for the flammable mixture.\n\n\n\nThe latitude and longitude of the storage vessels are 29? 44' 40.239\" North (29.744511?) and 95? 12' 34.0662\" West (-95.209463?), respectively.

The CAPS population estimate for the worst case scenario radius of 0.7 miles indicated a population of 0.  Based upon a review of an aerial photograph residential housing was present within the 0.7 mile radius.  Therefore, a one-mile radius was utilized in CAPS to determine the average household size (3.53) within the radius.  The number of residential parcels within or partially within the 0.7 mile radius was determined using parcel data from the Harris County Appraisal District, updated in July 2018.  This analysis identified fifteen (15) parcels.  Therefore, the estimated population is 15 parcels x 3.53 people per parcel = 53 people. This worst-case scenario has the potential to impact an estimated population of 53 people. No schools, hospitals, or other significant public gathering areas were identified within the impact area; however, multiple industrial facilities in the neighboring area could be affected. No sensitive environmental receptors were identified as potentially being affected by the worst-case release scenario.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nAs a RMP Prevention Program 3 facility, the facility is required to submit one alternative release scenario for an accidental flammable release.  A possible alternative flammable release scenario is a release at the butane unloading area as a result of a truck accidentally pulling away while still connected or a hose misconnection or malfunction during the unloading operation. This scenario was identified as a possibility in the process hazards analysis for the butane blending process.  The butane released could potentially ignite due to an engine spark and could cause the butane truck being unloaded to ca"

The BLEVE scenario yields a more conservative endpoint distance than that of a flash fire or vapor cloud fire thus the BLEVE was selected as the alternative scenario.  In the event of a flash fire or vapor cloud fire, this BLEVE alternative scenario should be referred to when assessing evacuation areas and potential offsite impacts.\n\n\n\nFor the BLEVE alternative scenario, the butane tanker truck is conservatively assumed to be carrying 9,000 gallons (44,285.4 pounds) of the butane flammable mixture.  The endpoint distance calculated as a result of this release is 0.3 miles (0.4 kilometers).  The latitude and longitude of this alternative scenario are 29? 44' 33.8532\" North (29.742737?) and 95? 12' 35.1792\" West (-95.209772?), respectively.  The Circular Area Profiles application (CAPS) (http://mcdc.missouri.edu/websas/caps10c.html) from the Missouri Census Data Center  was utilized to estimate the population impacted by this accidental release. This alternative scenario shows no potential impact on public residences or sensitive environmental receptors; however, in the event of a release of this magnitude the facility should make every effort to verify that the impacted area has been evacuated.  Furthermore, CAPS does not take into account industrial receptors in its population estimates; thus, the facility should notify all neighboring businesses and industrial complexes in the event of this accidental release scenario.  No sensitive environmental receptors were identified as potentially being affected by this alternative scenario.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nChevron views the health and safety of its employees and the communities in which it operates as its top priority.

The terminal did not experience RMP-related accidents since the butane blending process became operational.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe terminal maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the terminal has developed procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The ERP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to terminal processes or operations. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the terminal is coordinated with the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).
