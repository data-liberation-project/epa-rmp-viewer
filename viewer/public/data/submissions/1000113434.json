R. 68.42(a) as having an adverse impact on employees, the community, or the environment. If an incident governed by 40 C.F.R. 68.42(a) were to occur, we would conduct formal incident investigations designed to identify and address the root cause.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nWe have developed and maintain an emergency response plan which includes planning and training elements for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nBraskem believes in a philosophy of continuous improvement. A number of programs are in place to monitor the status of ongoing efforts and continually seek opportunities to improve. The facility maintains a structured safety process as well as employee safety teams that meet regularly.\n\nThe Plant has not identified any changes to safety practices necessary to achieve or maintain compliance with any applicable regulatory standard since our last submission.  However,  as part of our efforts to continually improve safety at the Plant, Braskem is currently training site personnel on Human Reliability to increase focus on higher risk tasks and effective problem-solving across all work groups."
