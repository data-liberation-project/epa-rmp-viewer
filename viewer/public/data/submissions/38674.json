      "SummaryText": "\nChlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  DWP prepared and submitted the RMP for the Tujunga Wells facility in June 1999.  This RMP is the five year update of the June 1999 RMP.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates t"

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe DWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station is located at 8801 Arleta Avenue in Sun Valley, California.  The facility is located approximately one-quarter mile east of the Hollywood Freeway (State 170) and immediately south of the Tujunga Wash River. This facility is a groundwater well field and pumping station complex.  The facility injects chlorine into a collector pipeline before entering or after leaving a 3-million gallon water contact tank.  The station consists of a chlorine storage room, a chlorination room, a chlorine control room, a chemical feed\\tool room, and a chlorine scrubber.  The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  A maximum of nine one-ton chlorine containers is stored at the Tujunga Wells chlorine building.  Six of these containers can be connected to "

The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms, which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Tujunga Wells facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nIn normal operation, four 1-ton chlorine containers are manifolded in two banks of two containers to supply chlorine.  These four containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and will close the valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  The facility has existing connections, without Halogen actuators, for one additional ton container to connect to each of the two banks.  These six containers rest on load cell scales, which allows the operators to monitor the chlorine weight in the containers.  There is also space for the storage of three additional ton chlorine containers, which can be used as spares, but are rarely used. \n\nChlorine gas is withdrawn from a bank of containers through pigtails, which are attached to the ton container gas valves.  The chlorine flows under pressure to a chlorine header to the pressure-sensitive automatic switchover valves.  The switchover valves are triggered by the rise in vacuum pressure in the chlorine feed line between the switchover valve and the chlorinator.  The rise in vacuum occurs when the chlorine container pressure approaches zero, which happens when the container is empty.  If this occurs, the switchover valve will open the al"

The chlorine gas then leaves the switchover valve under vacuum to the chlorinators in the adjacent room.  From the chlorinators, the gaseous chlorine then travels under vacuum to three chlorine injectors in an underground vault outside the station.  At the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high-pressure water supply to form a chlorine solution, which then travels to diffuser tubes located in the pipelines.\n\nResidual chlorine analyzers monitor residual chlorine downstream of the diffusers and provide feedback control for subsequent chlorine dosing.\nMultiple chlorine leak detectors have been installed inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar. \n\nThe Tujunga Wells site has also installed a caustic solution scrubber actuated by the chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm that can neutralize up to 2,500 lb of chlorine. \n\nA backup generator is provided for the scrubber.  All other chlorine alarms, communication systems, mitigation devices, and facility controls have backup power supplies or batteries that would allow them to operate if normal electrical power was interrupted. \n\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily. A response team coordinated from DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms, which may occur. Access to the facility is through gates, which are kept locked all the time.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n* Comprehensive safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\n* Comprehensive preventive maintenance pr"
