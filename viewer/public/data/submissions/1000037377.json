Should any accidental release occur,  North Central Farmers Elevator is prepared to work with our Local Emergency Management, local Fire and Ambulance Departments, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n    The primary activity at North Central Farmers Elevator West Bowdle Agronomy is the storage of liquid fertilizers for sale to farmers.  No Anhydrous Ammonia is stored at North Central Farmers Elevator West Bowdle.  One railcar of Anhydrous Ammonia and three railcars of Superphosphoric Acid are received and North Central Farmers Elevator hires Mears Incorporated to complete the conversion process.  No North Central Farmers Elevator employees are involved with the conversion process and no North Central Farmers Elevator Equipment is used.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia that Mears would handle would be 156000 pounds during the 15 hour conversion process.  \n\n\n\n   The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the railcar released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 156000 pounds, which represents the volume of the one railcar.  The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 5.6 miles.\n\n\n\n    The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a small release from a pressure valve.  The distance to endpoint(point of dispersion to 220pm) is 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\n     Accidental releases over the last five years are zero.  During the past five years no deaths, injuries or significant property damage has occurred at our facility due to accidental releases.  No offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage has o"
