Hill Brothers Chemical Company staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these chemicals.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has an Emergency Response Plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal RMP and OSHA PSM.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company trains its employees at this facility to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Hill Brothers Chemical Company will contact the Phoenix Fire Department to respond.  A designated emergency contact for the plant initiates emergency notifications.  All employees are trained in the proper procedures and their appropriate role in an emergency.

The facility also fills chlorine cylinders and manufactures bleach.  In addition, chlorine, ammonia and sulfur dioxide cylinders are stored and distributed to customers.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has a PSM/RMP program in place to manage the handling of the regulated substances in each covered process, which complies with Federal RMP and PSM requirements.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  The management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company prevention program emphas thorough training for its employees in hazard communication, proper handling, transfer, usage and storage methods, and emergency response procedures.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company standard operating procedures include diligent observation of process vessels, valves, and other equipment, and safe movement and storage of vessels.

Each metal cylinder and ton container has a steel valve protection cap, which covers the vessel valve or valves.  These steel protective caps are never removed from a container unless the container is being filled.  The warehouse where the chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are stored is a concrete building with a metal roof.  A fire suppression system is present in the building, which consists of automatic sprinklers that are activated in case of a fire.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (September 2006 to September 2011) for the Hill Brothers Chemical Company Phoenix Facility reveals that there were no reportable accidents during this period.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Hill Brothers Chemical Company Phoenix facility is continually evaluating ways to improve safety at the site.  Several studies have been conducted recently to examine mitigation measures and additional steps to further ensure public safety at the Hill Brothers Chemical Company Phoenix Facility.  The changes primarily include detailed reviews and updates of formal operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures to address comments and recommended actions identified through various analyses.  All recommended changes from the Process Hazard Analysis have been reviewed.\n"
