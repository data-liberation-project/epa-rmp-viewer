Schreiber has more than 30 manufacturing\n\nand distribution facilities globally in the United States, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France,\n\nGermany, India, Mexico, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain.\n\n\n\nThe SFI - Fairview Plant employs approximately 619 people. The SFI plant uses anhydrous\n\nammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage as well as for cooling of manufacturing process\n\nlines. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk\n\nManagement of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM)\n\nregulations, SFI has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our employees\n\nand the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility\n\ncompleted an initial process hazards analyses (PHAs) for ammonia using the industry standard\n\nWhat-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe most recent PHA revalidations were completed in 2016 using the HAZOP methodology which includes all situations evaluated in the IIAR's What-If?/Checklist Analysis. The original and revalidation PHAs were completed using technical and operations staff from the Fairview Plant as well as experienced facilitators. \n\n\n\nThe PHAs reviewed operational, human factors, and facility siting issues relative to the design of the\n\nrefrigeration system, and recommendations were made, as appropriate, to address these concerns.\n\nSFI's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia\n\nand measures that can be used to redu"
