Ammonia at the facility is kept entirely within the\r\nrefrigeration system, much as the refrigerant in your car air-conditioner. The SFI - Fairview\r\nPlant has not experienced a reportable release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents in the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nSFI is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the\r\nFairview Plant. Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of\r\nthe system. SFI employees at all levels have been involved in the development of the PSM and\r\nRMP programs.

Findings from the audits are reported to the facility, which then must correct the findings and provide written documentation of resolution of the findings to SFI's Safety Director.\r\n\r\nThe PSM written program incorporates the Plant's emergency response plan and places\r\nspecial emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of\r\nemergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\r\nMany of SFI's refrigeration and maintenance personnel have completed 24-hour HAZWOPER\r\nHAZMAT technician level training program. This training includes topics such as classification\r\nsystems and hazards identification; ammonia spill control and containment; respiratory protection; air\r\nmonitoring instrumentation; proper personal protective equipment; medical monitoring; and proper\r\ntermination procedures for emergency response activities. The facility conducts annual\r\nHAZWOPER refresher training to keep employees current and comfortable with their responsibilities\r\nunder the plan using classroom discussion and response to mock emergency scenarios. The facility\r\nalso conducts quarterly drills during which the emergency response team practices implementation\r\nof the incident command system to respond to mock emergency situations.\r\n\r\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SFI undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of\r\nthe accidental release of the largest vessel in the sy"
