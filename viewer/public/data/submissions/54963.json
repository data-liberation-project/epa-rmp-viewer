Sherwood Food Distributors requires that each facility develop and maintain accident prevention programs, applicable safety training, Crisis Management, continunity of operations, and emergency response plans appropriate to the installation. Each installation is also responsible for govermental regulatory compliance issues apply to the site. Sherwood Food Distributors Corporate Safety and Risk Office, and the Atlanta Division Risk Management Coordinator provide assistance in training for Atlanta Division employees, as well as procurement of safety and training needs.\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\nThe Atlanta Division Distribution Center is located at 5400 Fulton Industrial Boulevard in the southwest corner of the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia. The facility consists of areas for dry, cooler, and freezer storage of perishable and non-perishable items for distribution to customers.\n\nThe Atlanta Distribution Center has an ammonia refrigeration system that exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity. The ammonia refrigeration systems equipment is located in the compressor room in the southeast area of the building, except for the high pressure receiver (HPR). The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system capable of holding approximately 4,590 lbs. of ammonia. The HPR is located outside of the Distribution Center next to the southeast property boundary. \n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity in the ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Atlanta Distribution Centers refrigeration proces"

Atlanta Distribution Center will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program for ammonia. \n\nThe Atlanta Distribution Center has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. The PSM Program was re-engineered in 1998 for the ammonia process, and was revised in April 2008, and updated in June of 2009.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan; which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced. This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment. In developing the PSM Program, the Atlanta Distribution Center also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration processes. These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices. These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained. Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely. Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found. These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed. To ensure that the Atlanta Distribution Center refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify uns"

Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies. The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Five-year accident History\n\nThe Atlanta Distribution Center has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Atlanta Distribution Center has an Emergency Response Program in place. The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38. The site also has some internal emergency response capability, and has developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120. The current plan has been coordinated with the Fulton County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the State Emergency Response Commission. Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying the Georgia State Warning Point at (800) 241-4113 or (404) 656-6905.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNo changes are specifically identified but regular training sessions and compliance audits will be conducted. If deficiencies are noted in the compliance audits, then an action plan will be developed and areas of improvement will be abated in a timely manner."
