TVA exhibits progressive environmental leadership in managing its unified river and power system for\nmultiple public benefits, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power. TVA is committed to\nsetting the standard for environmental excellence among utilities and federal agencies, and to making the\nTennessee Valley a model in sustainable energy, resource, and economic development and management. TVA\nassures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, use effective environmental\nprocesses, and are held accountable for performance.\n\nTVA management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental\nrequirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties. We will assure\nenvironmental protection and reduce risks to our employees and communities in which we operate through\nproper environmental review of new developments and through safe technologies, operating procedures, and\nemergency preparedness. All activities will be conducted in accordance with current environmental and health\nand safety regulatory requirements.\n\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe affected facility consists of an anhydrous ammonia storage facility including two 30,000 gallon storage\ntanks with supporting unloading equipment, liquid transfer pumps, piping to convey the liquid ammonia,\nvaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a vapor, an ammonia vapor transport line, and a gas dilution and\ninjection system to inject ammonia into a selective catalytic reduction emission control system.\n\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility ? anhydrous ammonia. With two 30,000 gallon storage\ntanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any time is 266,700 pounds and\nthe ma"

TVA maintains documentation of safety information concerning chemical hazards,\noperating parameters, and equipment designs and specifications associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis ? TVA conducted comprehensive analyses of the process to ensure that hazards\nassociated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The Hazardous and Operability Study\n(HAZOP) analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was\nconducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process\noperations. Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed. The HAZOP analysis was conducted on\nJanuary 15-17, 2002 and a pre-startup HAZOP review was conducted on March 31, 2004.\n\nOperating Procedures ? TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting activities within\nour covered process. The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal startup,\nnormal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a\nturnaround or emergency shutdown. The information is readily available to operators and maintenance\npersonnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\nTraining ? TVA?s training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in\nthe operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the\nprocess and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process. The personnel are provided with refresher training\nat least every three years or more often if needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity ? TVA conducts well documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\nsafe and reliable operations. All process equipment routinely chec"

All maintenance operations conducted on the covered process are performed by qualified\npersonnel who have had proper training. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are\ncorrected promptly and safely.\n\nManagement of Change ? TVA maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process equipment,\nprocedures and monitoring technology which assures that any changes meet regulatory requirements.\nPersonnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the\nmodification and provided training to address the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Review ? A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new process.\nEstablished pre-startup safety review procedures assured that construction and installation of covered process\nequipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment\ninto operation and all elements of the RMP are in place.\n\nCompliance Audits ? TVA conducts environmental and safety audits on a regular basis and will determine\nwhether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The audits will be conducted at\nleast every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely\nimplemented.\n\nIncident Investigations ? Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a\nregulated substance is promptly investigated. Procedures ensure that investigations are undertaken to identify\nthe circumstances leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the situation surrounding\nthe release does not reoccur. All reports will be retained for at least 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation ? TVA believes in a team approach to process safety management and accident\nprevention. Employe"

In addition, our employees have access to all information developed through\nimplementation of the RMP, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors ? TVA develops partnerships with contractors to effectively conduct business and operate\ngeneration facilities, especially in maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, TVA\nevaluates the qualifications of the contractor including their safety performance. Procedures are in place to\nensure that contractors are properly informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and\nthe process involved, including the emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release of a\nregulated substance.\n\nV. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents associated with the anhydrous ammonia system since it was installed in 2004.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Plan\n\nTVA has an emergency response plan in place to respond to accidental releases of hazardous materials. The\nplan includes all aspects of emergency response plan requirements including adequate first aid and medical\ntreatment, safe shelter-in-place locations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public,\nand qualified contractor responder for post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan will be\npromptly updated to address any pertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the\nemergency response plan. In addition, periodic emergency response drills are conducted to keep employees,\ncontractors, and local responders familiar with the plan.\n\nVII. Five Year Update\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plans for TVA facilities are reviewed in detail prior to the five-year anniversary of the original submittal.  An audit was conducted April 2, 2009 for the purpose of revalidating the Bull Run "
