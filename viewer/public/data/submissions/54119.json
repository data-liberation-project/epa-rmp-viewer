TVA exhibits progressive environmental leadership in managing its unified river and power system for\nmultiple public benefits, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power. TVA is committed to\nsetting the standard for environmental excellence among utilities and federal agencies, and to making the\nTennessee Valley a model in sustainable energy, resource, and economic development and management. TVA\nassures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, use effective environmental\nprocesses, and are held accountable for performance.\n\nTVA management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental\nrequirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties. We will assure\nenvironmental protection and reduce risks to our employees and communities in which we operate through\nproper environmental review of new developments and through safe technologies, operating procedures, and\nemergency preparedness.

The Hazardous and Operability Study\n(HAZOP) analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was\nconducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process\noperations. Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed. The HAZOP analysis was conducted on\nJanuary 15-17, 2002 and a pre-startup HAZOP review was conducted on March 31, 2004.\n\nOperating Procedures \u00bf TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting activities within\nour covered process. The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal startup,\nnormal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a\nturnaround or emergency shutdown. The information is readily available to operators and maintenance\npersonnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\nTraining \u00bf TVA\u00bfs training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in\nthe operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the\nprocess and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.

Prior to selecting a contractor, TVA\nevaluates the qualifications of the contractor including their safety performance. Procedures are in place to\nensure that contractors are properly informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00bfs work and\nthe process involved, including the emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release of a\nregulated substance.\n\nV. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents associated with the anhydrous ammonia system since it was installed in 2004.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Plan\n\nTVA has an emergency response plan in place to respond to accidental releases of hazardous materials. The\nplan includes all aspects of emergency response plan requirements including adequate first aid and medical\ntreatment, safe shelter-in-place locations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public,\nand qualified contractor responder for post-incident decontamination of affected areas.
