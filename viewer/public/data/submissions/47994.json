A combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs are used to ensure the safety of our employees, the public as well as the environment. This document will provide a brief overview of all of the comprehensive risk management activities that Louisville Packaging has designed and implemented. Our site blends and packages a variety of refrigerant gases. We use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release, i.e., Difluoroethane and Propane.  A number of accident prevention programs are maintained at Louisville Packaging which implement chemical specific prevention steps in order to ensure a safe operation of all processes. These programs in place are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule along with EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  The following chemical-specific steps have been implemented as part of our prevention efforts: Maintain up-to-date technical standards; System designs that meet or exceed industry standards; Difluoroethane and propane meet the Corporate Safety Technology standards; Materials installed pass the Quality Assurance inspection process; Louisville Packaging performs Process Hazard Analyses on all new and installed systems; Offsite Consequence Analysis is performed where appropriate to include layers of protection; All new and/or modified processes are started up under a Test Authorization and each has a Pre-Startup Safety Inspection performed; All processes are inspected on a routine basis for mechanical integrity; Operators are trained on processes prior to startup; Mechanics and operators have individual training plans/classes for attaining and maintai"

Each of these individual elements combined make up our Prevention Program and each element works together to prevent any type of accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the high standard that these management systems set forth as the way we do business; and, we have specific accountabilities and controls in place to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. As a result of these high standards, Louisville Packaging has had no accidents in the past five (5) years with potential to cause a significant onsite or offsite effect. Louisville Packaging maintains a highly integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our programs provide the essential planning and training, which involves active drills to include follow-up for all emergency response drills and activities to ensure that workers, the public and the environment are effectively protected during any type of emergency situation.  Additionally, we coordinate our plan with the following local agencies: Louisville/Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (KY - Metro); Fairldale Fire Department; Kentucky Emergency Response Plan; Environmental Protection Agency IV; Municipal Sewer Distric; Jefferson County (Metro) Health Department; and Louisville Jefferson (Metro) County Emergency Management Agency.
