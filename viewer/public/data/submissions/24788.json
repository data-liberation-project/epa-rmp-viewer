Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Farmer's Cooperative Elevator Company located in Kingsley, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the site is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to local farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. the maximum quantity stored would be about 273,000 pounds in one (1) - 26,000 gallon storage tank and 37 - 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios:  A) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be about 112,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 % capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is about 2.4 miles. B) The Alternate Case Scenario, based on the five year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be about 26,640 pounds. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storag"

(ANSI) and the standards of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA Standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, peoperty damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency response Program:  The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
