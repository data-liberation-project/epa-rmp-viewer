(FC) accidental release prevention policy involves, but is not limited to technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the Iowa Fertilizer Law are adhered to. The emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n2. The FC facility at Latimer is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer. The location includes anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, nurse tank filling risers, electrical panels, lighting, and anhydrous ammonia safety equipment. The facility is manned only during the spring and fall ammonia season during normal business hours.\n\n3. FC's accidental release prevention plan is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Annual training of all personnel required to handle ammonia and what to do in an emergency\n\n* Facilities constructed and maintained according to the Iowa Fertilizer Law\n\n* Use of usual anhydrous ammonia safety equipment\n\n* Use of effective operating procedures according to Agricom's anhydrous ammonia safety procedures handbook and training videos\n\n* Annual inspections by IDALS of storage tanks, piping for leaks, nurse tanks, applicators, transfer risers, riser hoses, safety equipment, pressure relief valve records, etc.\n\n* FC site inspections by safety committee members at least twice a year\n\n4. No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n5. This facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Latimer Fire Department, which is a member of the North Central Regional Emergency Planning District (LEPC) in Iowa. This program includes response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency"
