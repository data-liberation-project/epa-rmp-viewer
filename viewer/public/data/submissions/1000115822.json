The worst-case scenario is far less probable than natural\ncatastrophes such as tornadoes that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury.

Tonawanda Terminal, hereafter referred to as the Facility, is a refined petroleum product storage and distribution facility in Tonawanda, NY.\n\nThe Facility handles and stores butane and various refined products.  The Facility has a fixed inventory of butane. Butane is received by truck and stored in one (1) 59,786-gallon pressurized storage vessel and subsequently injected into regular and premium gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck loading rack. The butane process has been assessed as RMP Program Level 3 and therefore meets or exceeds the accidental release and risk prevention requirements laid out in 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D. The Facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan and coordinates emergency response with the local LEPC and responders.\n\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Facility:\n\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.\n\nEnergy Transfer is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for neighbors in the community. Energy Transfer has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the Facility and community-wide and coordinates with the Erie County LEPC and local Fire Departments.\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Facility is to act as a flammable liquid storage and distribution facility. Due to\nthe flammable effects associated with butane; it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human\nexposure, to"
