The facility pipes butane off-site for blending into distillates.\n\n\n\nAt Texon, LP - Glenpool Terminal, hereafter referred to as the Glenpool Terminal or Facility, management and employees are committed to operating and maintaining this process in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Glenpool Terminal believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding safety and environmental performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which it operates. Texon, LP promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\n\nB. An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\n\nD. An overview of the emergency response program\n\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe primary function of Glenpool Terminal, located in Jenks, Oklahoma is to act as a Butane Blending (offload and storage) facility. The butane process has been classified as Program level 3. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances are identified. By virtue of its flammable effects, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handli"

Texon, LP is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Facility.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains 9 x 90,000 horizontal, storage vessels. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded via truck tanker to the vessels and then pumped off-site for injection. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 Degrees Fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail-safe), emergency shut-off devices on the system, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding devices. Access to Glenpool Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, authorized contractors/visitors and tenants.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\n\nPREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nTexon, LP accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning programs provide for effective management of the hazards posed by regulated substances to Facility employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP (40 CFR Part 68), as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR1910.119). The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Glenpool Terminal:\n\n\n\n1) Employee Participation\n\n2) Process Safety Information\n\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\n4) Standard Operating Procedures\n\n5) Operator and Contractor Training\n\n6) Contractors\n\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n\n9) Safe Work Permits\n\n10) Management of Change\n\n11) Accident or Potential Catast"

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release does occur, an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) is in place for the Facility with response activities being coordinated with the Glenpool Fire Department and Tulsa Area EMA.\n\n\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nTexon, LP has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Facility maintains records for all significant accidental chemical releases. This is a new process with no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nResponse actions are coordinated with the Glenpool Fire Department. An ERAP is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.38, and SARA Title III. The Glenpool ERAP provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Contained in these Plans are written procedures that outline the actions to occur for various types of emergencies that could occur at the Facility. These emergencies include: releases of chemical substances, fires, explosions, and medical events. The Programs address all aspects of emergency actions including:\n\n\n\n- Roles and responsibilities of personnel in the event of an incident;\n\n- Procedures for notifying employees that a release has occurred;\n\n- Procedures for evacuatio"

This equipment includes portable fire extinguisher and first aid equipment. An inspection, testing and maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment. Fire extinguishers are inspected monthly and receive annual maintenance per the International Fire Code and NFPA. Inspection reports for emergency response equipment are filed on-site. Three wet hydrants are also located on-site for fire department use.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Glenpool Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Glenpool Fire Department and request their assistance. The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire capability. The Facility's emergency action plans are coordinated with the Fire Department and EMA. The Glenpool Fire Department is aware of the Facility's butane system, facility access and water sources. Glenpool Terminal maintains a vegetation control program to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the butane systems.\n\n\n\nTexon, LP maintains a relationship with the Glenpool Fire Department. Tours and drills with members of local emergency response organizations are held routinely. These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the Facility.\n\n\n\nE.
