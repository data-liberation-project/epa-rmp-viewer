The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Southwest Landmark, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as fertilizer for crop production nutrients.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage And Handling Of Anhydrous Ammonia?.  The facility has also complied with the ?Regulations For Storing And Handling Fertilizer Anhydrous Ammonia? as regulated by the Ohio Department of Agriculture.\n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nWe have had one accidental release in the past five years.  No one offsite was injured.  Two homes were evacuated as a precaution and several homes were notified of the release.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n-a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n-a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n6. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nSafety impro"
