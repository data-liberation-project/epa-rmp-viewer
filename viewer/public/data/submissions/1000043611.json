The facility handles a variety of Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG) that are considered hazardous by federal regulations.  These are flammable gases, so it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent accidents which may result in exposure to both workers and the nearby community.  Aeropres Corporation adheres to all Federal, State and Local rules and regulations pertaining to the handling and management of these chemicals and emergency response planning.  Safety at this facility depends primarily on:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe manner in which we handle these products,\r\n\u00bf\tThe safety devices inherent in the design of the facility and our processes,\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintenance procedures, and\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee training.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program details employee responsibilities, actions, and includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and the local LEPC to notify potentially affected neighbors. \r\n\r\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nAeropres Corporation produces aerosol propellants for the aerosol industry.  The facility in Morris, IL was built in 1993 in Grundy County, in accordance with all Federal, State and Local requirements, and with strict compliance to NFPA #58, #70 and #15 specifications.  The LPG handled at the facility which are above RMP threshold values include propane, isobutene, butane, difluoroethane, methyl ether, butane, pentane, isopentane and propylene.   \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe facility receives raw LPG by rail and by trucks. We process this material to remove trace contaminants and impurities.  The products are then blended to customer specification, and stored in tanks for shipment by rail and trucks. We also receive into our plant Dimethyl Eth"

All employees are thoroughly trained on the characteristics and safe handling of LPG.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no reported accidents at this facility in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nOur emergency response plan is coordinated with the local LEPC, who also coordinates with the local fire and police departments. Our personnel are trained to react to any emergency situation that may develop in the handling of our products. Should there be any accidental release we have a program in place to alert all emergency responders and the public.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety at our plant will include the updating of any new or improved safety and mitigation devices required by NFPA #58, which governs our facility. We will also update the training of our employees to insure their safety awareness."
