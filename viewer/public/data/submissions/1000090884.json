Currently Chlorine Gas and sulfur dioxide are the only hazardous substances covered under RMP at the facility. Subject materials are received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound and 2000 pound gas cylinders. These chemicals are not used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility. Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors. This process\n\nis subject to RMP Program Level 3.\n\n\n\nHarcros has a long standing commitment to safety and protection of the environment. We take a\n\nsystematic and proactive approach to preventing the accidental release of hazardous chemicals. We are proud to not have a reportable release at this site in the past 5 years. As members of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) we adhere to the principals of Responsible Distribution and are committed to continuous improvement.\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are several action items related to a 11/12/2020 PHA related to procedures and\n\ndocumentation that will be implemented in a timely manner.\n\n"
