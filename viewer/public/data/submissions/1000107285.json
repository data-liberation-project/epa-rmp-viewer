There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the facility.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Cuero West Dehy Facility does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the facility does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure for flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  The Ethane-Propane-Butane-Pentane Mix was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of the entire inventory in the largest storage vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would not have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the EPA's RMP* Comp &trade; dispersion modeling\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantaneously released.

The Cuero West Dehy Facility has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the facility processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by several people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  The MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent similar incidents, and forwards these results to management for further action. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are fully implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the Risk Management Program is functioning properly, the Cuero West Dehy Facility periodically conducts audits to verify that the policies, procedures and practices required by the Risk Management Program are being implemented properly and fully, to evaluate the effectiveness of the program, and to develop ideas for improving the program.  These audits are independent, site-specific, and methodical.  Compliance audits are conducted every 3 years.  The findings of the audit are forwarded by the audit team to facility management for priority resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained for future review.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPEC"

The following is a description of existing safety features in place to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe Risk Management Program summarized above is applied throughout the Cuero West Dehy Facility.  \n\nCollectively, these prevention program activities work to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Cuero West Dehy Facility has safety features throughout the facility to: \n\n* Contain/control a release.\n* Quickly detect a release.\n* Reduce the consequences of a release in the unlikely event of an accidental release.\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the facility's processes:\nRelease Detection, including:\n\n* Hydrocarbon gas detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control, including:\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare system to contain and incinerate releases.\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure or temperature);\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system); and\n6. Pressure safety relief devices.\n\nRelease Mitigation, including:\n\n1. Emergency Shut-Down (ESD) System to immediately isolate and shut down the process to minimize the release\n2. Immediate access to and communication with local emergency response organizations, including the fire department, police, and other local emergency response organizations.\n3. Emergency Response Plan, which is a detailed emergency action plan that includes detailed procedures for responding to accidental releases; and\n4. Incident Response"

The plan consists of detailed procedures for responding to accidental releases, as well as procedures for responding to fires that might occur in the unlikely event of a release of a flammable substance. These response procedures address the following aspects of emergency response, and more:\n\n* Proper first aid and treatment for any exposures.\n* Evacuation plans which include provisions for accounting for all personnel (employees, contractors, and visitors) after an evacuation.\n* Notification to appropriate emergency response agencies; and\n* Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \n\nThe facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of incident response equipment intended to ensure that the equipment will work as designed in the event of an emergency.  Training is conducted to ensure the proper use of emergency response equipment, such as fire-fighting equipment. \n\nThe overall incident response program for the Cuero West Dehy Facility is coordinated with the Karnes County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry represe"

The Cuero West Dehy Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a method for notifying the public in the event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Cuero West Dehy Facility conducts periodic emergency response drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRather than implement improvements in an ad hoc manner, the Cuero West Dehy Facility has processes in place that are employed to improve safety on a continuing and ongoing basis, to ensure that the safety programs are continuously improved.  These processes include the following:\n\n* Safety teams.\n* Incident response drills involving off-site emergency responders.\n* Process Hazards Analysis revalidations.\n* Management of change.\n* Mechanical Integrity & Quality Assurance.\n* Compliance audits.\n* Continued focus on the \"The Goal is Zero\" for injuries and incidents.\n\nSAFETY IS A JOB REQUIREMENT FOR ALL EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS.\n\nAT CONOCOPHILLIPS, OUR WORK IS NEVER SO URGENT OR IMPORTANT THAT WE CANNOT TAKE THE TIME TO DO IT SAFELY."
