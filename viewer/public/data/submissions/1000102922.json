AFCO is a full-service partner throughout all areas of the client facilities and their process management. Working alongside our clients AFCO delivers expertise and hands-on support to help meet sanitation, compliance, and operational needs efficiently and cost-effectively.\nThe 360,000 square foot Kingman facility serves as a site for the manufacturing, packaging, and distribution of AFCO products. The facility is divided into two sections. Section One is used for manufacturing and distribution of Peracetic Acid (PAA) and is 105,000 square feet. Section Two is used for the distribution of other AFCO cleaning, sanitation, and maintenance products. The Kingman facility became fully operational in early 2022.   \n\nPAA is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Risk Management Planning (RMP) listed chemical and is produced at the Kingman facility by mixing glacial acetic acid (GAA), hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid, and de-ionized (DI) water from bulk storage tanks located on site, along with the manual addition of other chemicals. The PAA is mixed in two 3,000-gallon mixing tanks. The PAA is pumped from the mixing tank into 330-gallon totes primarily, and in some cases into 55-gallon drums. There is a 3,200-gallon PAA storage tank. The warehouse has the capacity to store 350, 330-gallon totes of PAA.  The Kingman facility will ship products to other AFCO facilities and directly to customers. \n\nBased on the materials handled, and offsite consequence analysis, the Kingman facility is characterized as a Program 2 facility. \n\nRMP Program Level Determination\n\nPeracetic Acid (PAA) [Ethaneperoxoic Acid] (CAS 79-21-0) is listed in 40 CFR 68.130 \u0096 List of Substances.
