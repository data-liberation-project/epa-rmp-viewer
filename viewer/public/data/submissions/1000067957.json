      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe AmeriGas Reno terminal is propane storage and distribution facility. It is spread across the north side and the south side. The north side includes four (4) above-ground storage tanks which each have a 30,000 gallon capacity. It also has two (2) Compressors used to unload the rails cars and has two (2), Liquid Pumps. Liquid propane is loaded to transports using the liquid pumps. Additionally, there is a condenser in the north side that is used during vapor recovery to liquefy propane gas and route liquid propane to the Storage Tanks.\n\nThe south side has four propane tanks with the following capacity; one 30,000 Gallons capacity, one 18,000 Gallons capacity, one 17,500 Gallons capacity and one 10,500 Gallons Capacity. The south side has two Corken Compressors and 1 Ingresol Rand Compressor. On the south side, one pump is used to load transport.\n\nThe terminal has four rail towers designed to hook to rail cars and unload product to storage tanks using a system of compressors. Compressors withdraw propane vapors from the storage tanks and compress them or increase their pressure and discharge into the rail cars to be unloaded. This process slightly decreases the pressure in the bulk storage tanks and increases the pressure in the rail cars. As a result, liquid propane flows from rail car to the bulk storage tanks.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy \n\n\n\nThe same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our operations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. The Facility has Logistics Managers and a Terminal Operations Supervisor who are able to immediately respon"

AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country.  The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario \n\nFor flammables, vapor cloud explosion is specified as worst case scenario. Worst case scenario is analyzed by estimating distance to an overpressure endpoint of 1 psi resulting from vapor cloud explosion of a cloud containing largest quantity of regulated substance from a vessel or process pipe failure. Per CFR 68.25.b.1, \"For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\" is the worst case scenario.\n\nThe greatest amount of propane held is 30,000 Gallons or 110,000 lbs. The total quantity released was 110,000 lbs. The propane was assumed to disperse in the flammable range, encounter areas of sufficient congestion and confinement and result in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nUsing EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst case distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.4 miles.\n\nAssumption\n\nRMP Comp was used as a tool to calculate distance to endpoints of 1 psi overpressure. RMP assumes meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario of atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour). Ambient air temperature assumed is 25 deg C (77 deg F). TNT-equivalent model is used which assumes a yield factor of 10 percent.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nFor alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was considered. The active mitigation devices were assumed to work "

      "SummaryText": "as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. Using equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis), the calculated distance to 1 psi over pressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\n\nBroken or burst propane loading hoses were determined to be the most common failure. Pumps and Compressors were also considered. Maintenance and mitigation devices are in place that would mitigate the risks. Vessel overfilling is mitigated administratively. The storage tanks are filled only to a maximum of  85 %  of the total capacity to allow expansion of the product.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations. \n\nNotification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel. If an actual incident occurs, the plan gives guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site. Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required. \n\nThe plans are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain up-to-date, reflecting current activities on site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility has no plans at the present time to make any changes.\n\n"
