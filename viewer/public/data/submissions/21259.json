All refinery process units are currently managed under the PSM standard. Therefore these processes are, in effect, being managed as RMP Program Level 3 processes. The refinery has a thoroughly-trained, experienced, safety-motivated workforce that has achieved an outstanding safety record. The refinery is in full compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nWilliams Refining has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the time, money, and effort invested in training personnel and promoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Safety tools include engineering controls, real time process monitoring, level, pressure, and temperature alarms, leak detection systems, and automatic and manual mitigation systems. If a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond quickly and effectively to control and contain the release. \n\nTo comply with the RMP standard we have focused upon the following: \n\n* Maintaining the management system established by PSM\n* Adapting the PSM management system to address RMP\n* Performing the hazard assessments\n* Compiling the data elements\n* Communicating with the public concerning RMP issues \n\nPublic Communication of RMP\n\nWilliams Refining assumed a leadership role in organizing a community-wide RMP Symposium that took place April 13, 1999 at the Agricenter International.

Expert speakers, emergency response equipment, and live demonstrations of Shelter-in-Place and HAZMAT response were also featured. We estimate that 600 people attended the symposium.\n\nThe refinery has been working with our Community Advisory Panel (CAP) to identify effective means for communicating RMP/safety information to our immediate neighboring community. CAP members have provided many helpful suggestions, and have offered to distribute our RMP-related printed materials at various venues in the community. Williams Refining and the CAP members agree that RMP/safety communication should be an ongoing effort.\n\nHazard Assessment Results - Identification of Scenarios\n\nRelease scenario results were estimated using the RMPlanner software published by JBF Associates. The software calculates estimated distances to endpoint based on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Lookup Tables. Hydrofluoric (HF) acid is the only covered toxic that is present in the refinery in a threshold quantity. All HF in the refinery is in the Alkylation Unit. The largest inventory of RMP flammables is in the LPG spheres.\n\nHydrofluoric Acid Release Scenarios and Off Site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe EPA-defined toxic worst case scenario (WCS) at the refinery is a catastrophic loss of containment of the largest possible inventory of HF. All of our prevention and mitigation systems must be assumed to fail in this scenario.

The estimated maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this WCS is 1.8 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases, no credit for prevention measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe flammable ARS at the refinery is a VCE resulting from a 10-minute venting of B/B Mix through the 4-inch pressure relief valve atop the storage sphere. This pressure relief valve is set at 280 psi. In 10 minutes about 430,000 lbs. of B/B Mix could escape. The estimated maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.27 miles (1400 ft). The venting would be stopped by diverting process flow to a different LPG tank, or by opening a valve to another LPG tank.\n\nB/B Mix was chosen as the worst case flammable because this mixture has the greatest explosive energy of the LPG mixtures stored on site. Other LPG mixtures contain propane, propylene, butane, isobutane, and butylenes in varying ratios.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nWilliams Refining has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. No incident has resulted in off site effects (deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, shelter-in-place, or environmental damage) as defined by EPA's RMP guidelines (RMP-covered process and RMP-covered chemical).

The Safety and PSM Department is responsible for implementing the training program.\n\nContractors\n\nWilliams Refining has developed a Contractor Safety Program to satisfy and exceed PSM guidelines by extending plant safety requirements to non-Williams employees working within the refinery. The Program is intended to maintain a plant-wide, consistent level of safe work performance. The Safety and PSM Department is responsible for enforcing the Contractor Safety Program. Such enforcement involves not only the contractor's responsibilities, but also Williams Refining's obligations under paragraph (h) of the PSM standard. The Contractor Safety Program includes the following:\n\n* Requires contract bidders to provide information on accident rates and the contractor's safety program.\n* Requires the contractor to verify each employee's knowledge of job safety, craft skills, and equipment operation before assignment to onsite work.\n* Restricts bid requests to those contractors who have satisfied minimum requirements. Those requirements include a documented drug screening program, a comprehensive Safety Action Plan, and English fluency for employees performing safety-sensitive work.\n* Establishes pre-job meetings, pre-job safety orientation confer"

These measures include written maintenance procedures, training in maintenance activities, an inspection and testing program, safe and timely correction of equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance in fabrication, installation, and spare parts. The Maintenance and Engineering Departments are responsible for the administration of the mechanical integrity program of the Memphis Refinery. Responsibility for specific aspects of mechanical integrity rests with the appropriate group - mechanical, instrument/controls, or inspection. The Memphis Refinery's mechanical integrity program accomplishes the following:\n\n* Establishes responsibility for various aspects of the mechanical integrity program, divided among three groups - mechanical, instrumentation/controls, and inspection.\n* Requires procedures for the management of each of the three mechanical integrity groups. The procedures must include a description of the group organization, standards for the development of procedures, a description of quality assurance measures, a written description of employee and contract employee training, a description of document controls, and requirements for periodic compliance audits.\n* Sets general operation and maintenance training requirements for maintenance employees.\n* Sets guidelines for the conduct and documentation of process equipment inspection and testing.\n* Requires safe and timely correction of equipment deficiencies.\n* Assures integrity and quality in the suitability, installation, and maintenance of equipment.\n\nWork is performed under the supervision of a maintenance craft foreman. Operations and Safety Department personnel provide support to ensure that work is carried out safely. Technical support is provided by Process Engineering and the Engineering Project Group.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nWilliams Refining has longstanding safe hot work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

Safety responsibility covers maintaining safe work conditions, control of unsafe acts, holding safety meetings, and accident investigation.\n* Requires periodic audits to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their responsibilities under OSHA 1910.119.\n* Establishes access control (card access system) for the process areas.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nWilliams Refining conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) any time new equipment or modifications to existing equipment change the associated process safety information. The review is intended to verify and document that all aspects of the equipment's design, construction and operation have been evaluated, and to certify that the equipment can safely be placed in operation. The PSSR team uses checklists and field verification of construction to examine  all aspects of readiness. The PSSR is the final step in the construction or installation of new or modified equipment before the equipment is placed in service. The review addresses 1) design and construction, 2) maintenance and inspection, 3) procedures, and 4)training.\n\nUnder most circumstances, the lead engineer on the project is responsible for arranging and facilitating the PSSR, although any employee involved with the project may conduct the review. Participation in the PSSR depends upon the extent and complexity of the project. For large projects, process units for example, the PSSR team is composed of representatives from all involved departments. For small projects, such as the replacement of noncritical valves or pumps, an individual may conduct and document the review.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n1910.119 (j) requires employers to take specific measures to maintain the ongoing integr"
