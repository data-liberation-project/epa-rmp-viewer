The quantity of formaldehyde released was minimized by considering a deluge system.\n?  Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of propylene with off-site consequences.  No mitigation factors were considered.     \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code.  \n\n? The Caprolactam plant is equipped with many safety features to minimize oleum release potential.  Automatic shut-offs and relief devices accommodate fluctuations in temperature and pressure.  Warning alarms, video monitoring, regular equipment inspections, and pressure monitoring in pipes and vessels provide advance notice of potential operational upsets.   Specialized oil and foam spill blanket systems and a scrubber system provide a protective barrier in the event of a spill.          \n? As with other chemicals of concern, ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic shut-off and relief devices to handle fluctuations in temperature and pressure.  Warning alarms, leak detectors, regular equipment inspections, and pressure monitoring in pipes and vessels provide layers of protection for employees and the community.\n? The formaldehyde storage tank is equipped with a spill pit to contain the contents of any accidental liquid releases.  The tank is also equipped with a water-fog system to control vapor releases.

Systems are in place to quickly relocate or dispose of flammables in emergency situations.  Continuous monitoring of pipe and vessel pressure identify potential leaks for further protection.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThis facility has had one accidental release from a covered process over the past five years, which meets the reporting criteria under 40 ?CFR 68.42(a).  The release reulted from an adjacent non-covered process which impacted the covered process. No on site injuries or deaths occurred as a result of the release.  There was significant on site property damage caused by an explosion and fire in the non-covered process.  The release resulted in no offsite injuries, deaths or environmental damage. Although the release did not leave the industrial boundary, offsite residents were advised to shelter in place as a precaution.  Additionally, limited property damage occurred offsite as a result of the pressure wave caused by an explosion in the non-covered process.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nEmergency response programs are in place for both internal preparation and coordination with the community.  The Freeport site plan is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure community safety.  Annual drills are coordinated with the community and the community warning sirens are tested weekly.  In the event of an incident, information is transmitted over a local radio station.  BASF participates in the Industrial CAER program (Community Awareness and Emergency Response), which operates a hotline for communication with the community.  In addition to the site plan, each operating unit has a block specific emergency plan.  These plans contain information specific to chemicals within that unit.  Incident commander training is conducted annually and two drills are stag"
