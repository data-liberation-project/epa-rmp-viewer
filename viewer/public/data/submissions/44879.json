WRS operates a number of water and wastewater treatment facilities throughout unincoportated Hillsborough County. Allpllicable procedures of the United State Environmental Protection Agency  are ahered to . WRS emergency response policy involoves the preparation of response plans specific for eacg facility.  Each facility is in compliance with the EPA emegency program requirements.\n\nThe Northwest Regional Decholorination facility is located at 9320 West Water Avenue. Dechlorination is necessary priot psurface discharge of highly treated wastewater.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two releas scenarios, idenfied as \"worst case scenario\" and \" alternative scenario\"/ The first scenario is defined by the EPA which states that the \"owner or operator\" shall assume that the \u00bf maximum quanitity in the largest vessel \u00bf is released as a gas over 10 mnutes.\" due to unspecified failure. The alternative scenarios is identified as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\"\n\nAtmoshperhic modeling has to be performed to determin the distance traveled by the hazardous chemical before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" as selected by the EPA. For sulfur dioxide, the extremeley hazardous substance utilized at the Northwest Regional Dechlorination Facility, EPA has determined 3 ppm to be the toxic endpoint. This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which would impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a circle with a  radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance"

      "SummaryText": "has to be defined to \"estimate the population potentially affected.\" \n\nThe worst case scenario at the Northwest Regional Dechlorination Facility involves the unspecified failyre of a single one-tone sulfue dioxide container. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis was performed for two sets of conditions. The first set followed conditions specified by the EPA. The EPA conditions assume the release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of one-hour ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the popluation residing wihtin a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these guidelines to facilitiate the performacne of offsite consequence analysis. WRS believes the EPA assumptions to be unrealistic because:\n\nA. Only a fraction fo the compressed liquified sulfur dioxide released to the atmosphere flashes as a vapor. The remaining liquid forms liquid droplet aerosols. This reults in the formation of a vary dense chemical consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristics significantly different than for a cloud of only sulfur dioxide gas.\n\nB. Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwinde of the releae point is potentially affected. The plume area, or footprint, can reasonably be expected to be no more than approximately 6% of the area of the full circle.\n\nEPA mandated meterological conditions, Stablit F, wind speed of 1.5 m/second, hightes daily maximum temperature and average humidty were used for the modeling. \n\nMitigation systems to be considered include the sulfur dioxide leak detection system and the vacuum piping. The system is a vacuum system. This type of system is in use and can be expected to significantly reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide released in case of apigtail or piping failure. \n\nRelease Prevention Program is based on several key elements:\n\n1. High level of training of operators and maintenance staff.\n2. Preventative maintenance program.  \n3.n State of the art"
