      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nSouthcross owns and operates a natural gas processing plant (Woodsboro Plant), NAICS Code 211112, located near Woodsboro in Refugio County, Texas.  The facility is designed and operated in manner that minimizes the potential for accidental releases.  Southcross has established systems to ensure the safe operation of the facility.  These systems include the risk management program (RMP) to assure compliance with the EPA requirements found in 40 CFR Part 68.  This submission is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements associated with an RMP Program 1 facility.\n\n\n\na.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nThe Woodsboro Plant utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, trained employees take actions to contain, mitigate, monitor and stop releases.  Local responders are prepared for accidental releases through regular communications and meetings.\n\n\n\nThe Sr. Vice President, Operations, with the assistance of the Director, EHS&T, is responsible for the overall implementation of RMP and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) activities.  The Director, Regional Operations, with the assistance of the Plant Superintendent, is responsible for RMP and PSM implementation and integration at the plant.  The Plant Superintendent is responsible for local coordination with emergency responders.  Overall, Southcross makes it the responsibility of all employees to carry out their duties in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nb.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Woodsboro Plant is a 200 MMSCFD natural gas processing plant, which receives gas through pipelines.  The plant processes are designed to remove entrained carbon dioxide and water from raw natural gas, through amine and glycol dehydration systems.  A cryogenic system separates methane from heavier natural gas liquids (NGL).  Methane is routed through compressors and transported out of the plant th"

      "SummaryText": "rough a pipeline.  NGL is also, primarily, transported out of the plant through pipelines.  \n\n\n\nAn intermediate step in the process includes a 60,000 gallon NGL storage tank. The NGL components include ethane, propane, isobutene, isopentane, and pentane.  These flammable substances are listed in the RMP regulations and are found in quantities that trigger the RMP requirements.  Among other process controls, administrative controls are in place to keep the quantity of the tank at or below 50%.\n\n\n\nc.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe RMP Program 1 requirements are applicable to the Woodsboro Plant.  Program 1 applicability was determined through a scenario based study conducted by Providence Engineering and Environmental during June 2012.  No changes have occurred which would alter the scenario or change the Program 1 applicability.  While a prevention program is not required for an RMP Program 1 facility, Woodsboro does maintain a PSM program.  The PSM program contains elements that are similar to an RMP Prevention Program. \n\n \n\nd.    Five Year Accident history\n\n\n\nThe Woodsboro Plant has not experienced any accidental releases that resulted in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\ne.    Emergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nA local emergency response plan has been implemented at the plant.  The plan was updated in 2016 and represents the current operations at the plant.  Plant and corporate personnel communicate with local response agencies to assure safe response activities.  During the first quarter of 2016 several local response agencies and governmental officials participated in a meeting at the plant to review operations and emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n \n\nf. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Woodsboro Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews and a program soliciting safety suggestions from employees.\n\n"
