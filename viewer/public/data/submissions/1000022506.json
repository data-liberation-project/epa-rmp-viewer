All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.  This process is a program level 3 as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40CFR68). \r\n\r\nThe system is continuously monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is inspected periodically for proper operation 24 hours per day.  Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\r\n\r\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, ammonia detectors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with a shutdown system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room.  The system shutdown can be manually operated using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\r\n \r\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic drills.  The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in any onsite or offsite injuries or any offsite environmental damages.\r\n\r\nHillshire Brands, Haltom City Texas Plant has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EP"
