The Condensate Storage Vessel is surrounded by a berm that will limit that area impacted by a release by minimizing the surface area of the liquid. \n\nSJFM operators inspect the Condensate Storage Vessel at least once per day.  While at the facility, the operator's duties include inspection of pipelines, vessels, chemical containers and other equipment for leaks. Additionally, SJFM periodically leak tests the threaded connections, valves, flanges, and other connectors under requirements issued by the San Joaquin Valley unified Air Pollution Control District.\n\nSJFM has established the following emergency response policy. In the event of a release of a regulated materials employees have been directed to contact either the Vice President or Operations Manager of SJFM who will then notify local emergency responders and the Office of Emergency Services (OES).  If they are not readily available the employee is to contact local emergency services and the OES. \n\nOn-site employees will be notified of the release and leave by the nearest direct and safe route to an off-site location.  Employees will assemble at a safe location on Panama Lane for a head count.  All employees are provided radios for use during normal operations.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSJFM operates the Ten Section Oil Production Lease located within the Ten Section Oil Field in Kern County, California.  The primary activity of this site is oil production.  Associated natural gas is treate"

      "SummaryText": "d at the Ten Section Gas Plant to remove water and condensable hydrocarbons (condensate).  Treated natural gas is transferred via pipeline to the Southern California Gas Company.  The condensate is stored in a 30,000 gallon horizontal vessel prior to sale.  The Condensate Storage Vessel contains greater than 10,000 pounds of a regulated flammable substance, therefore this vessel is subject to the requirements of California's Accidental Release Program (Cal-ARP) and the Federal Risk Management Program. The Gas Plant is also subject to the provisions of Cal-ARP due to the hard-pipe connection between the Gas Plant and the Condensate Storage Vessel. \n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nA release of the entire contents of the Condensate Storage Vessel was modeled to determine the worst-case release scenario.  The Distance to Endpoint for a release of flammable substances from this vessel was calculated using the Offsite Consequence Analysis procedure issued by U. S. EPA.  The Distance to Endpoint is 0.42 miles.\n\nAdministrative controls and mitigation measures for the Worst-Case scenario are not required.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSJFM periodically provides chemical hazard awareness training to all employees.  Employees are informed of the hazards of all chemicals produced and stored at the facility.  Employees are trained to notify responding agencies in the event of a release of a regulated substance or other hazardous chemical. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSJFM acquired the Ten Section facility from Texaco, Inc. in December of 1998.  A search of facility records and EPA databases does not reveal any accidental releases of a regulated substance during the past five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSJFM has a written emergency response program for each facility.  In the event of a release of a regulated substance or other regulated materials employees are directed to contact either the Vice-president or Operat"
