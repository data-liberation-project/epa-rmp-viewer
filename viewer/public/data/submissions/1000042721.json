This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. The objective of risk management is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, the Chemical Plant's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nExxonMobil Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing a set of structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS). In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against an international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to the requirements of ISO 14001. After an extensive review, which included a number of audits of various ExxonMobil Corporation facilities, Lloyd's concluded that the \"environmental components of the OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the\n\nrequirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard.\" They went on to say, \"We further believe ExxonMobil Corporation to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Chemical Plant, located in Baytown, Texas, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce a variety of petrochemical products such as Butyl Rubber, polypropylene plastic, and a number of chemical intermediate feedstocks. Several regulated flammable substances and flammable mixtures and toxic substances are contained"

EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP).  Some processes at the Chemical Plant are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe hazard assessments were done using EPA's RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  This Guidance covers all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both Worst Case (WCS) and Alternate Release (ARS) scenarios.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chemical Plant. This section addresses the following elements:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training,\n\nContractors, Pre-startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Changes, Incident Investigation and Compliance Audits.  The accident prevention program at the Chemical Plant equally covers all individually listed regulated substances, flammable mixtures, and toxic substances.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Chemical Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to information created as part of the Chemical Plant accident prevention program, which is documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Chemical Plant. In addition, the Chemical Plant has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives "

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific groups within the Chemical Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the Chemical Plant has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions. The Chemical Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these safe limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems).\n\n\n\nThe Chemical Plant also maintains numerous documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. These documents include information such as materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Chemical Plant primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique.  These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated. The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards on the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Mitigation options are identified and evaluated.  Selected mitigation options are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution and completion of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls are consistent with design safety features, the Chemical Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews, hazard reviews are also performed during the design stage of new facilities and for facilities undergoing significant modification.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Chemical Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as;\n\n(1)    initial startup;\n\n(2)    normal operations;\n\n(3)    temporary operations;\n\n(4)    emergency shutdown;\n\n(5)     emergency operations;\n\n(6)    normal shutdown; and,\n\n(7)     start-up following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.\n\n"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chemical Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in Chemical Plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstrations) they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operations technicians periodically receive refresher training on key operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted monthly. Each key procedure is refreshed at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nTraining is also provided for each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment.
