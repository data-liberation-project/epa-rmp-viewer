The Facility Policy.\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any othe chemical that is stored at this facility. The Great Bend Coop is a Agri Alliance's AG 21 member (Farmland Industries). With this program the Great Bend Coop strives to go beyond industry standard for employee, patron and enviromental safety.\n2. Facility information.\nThe NH3 plant is located on the north east side of Albert Kansas, the facility is located in the city limits. The old 18,000 gal tank has been replaced with a 30,000 gal tank. The old tank has been sold and will be removed after EPA and State Agriculture compliance.\n3. The worst case and alternate case release scenario..\nBoth scenarios come from the RMP*Comp. Worst case involves a release of the total amount of product stored at the facility of 140,196 pounds in a ten minute period, with 14,000 pound per minute, toxic endpoint would be 4.4 miles effecting about 250 people. Alternate release would be an overfill of 100 pound or 10 pounds per minute over a period of ten minutes. Toxic endpoint would be less than .1 mile efecting about 25 people.\n4. Accidental release prevention program.\nThe Coop reconizes all safety procedures required by State and Federal Requlations. The Coop also complies with recomendation from the AG-21 program. The most common release would be overfilling nurse trailers, policy states not to fill above 85 percent, however on a cool morning a tank could be filled to 85% and release in the warm after noon. \n5. Five year Accidient History.\nThe facility has not had a reportable release withen the past five years.\n6. Emergency response program\nThe Coop has an Emergency Action Plan, Emergency Response Plan, an active Safety Committee. All areas have worked with the County, city of Albert, and the Coop's insurance company to develope these plans. Rod Cushenbery is the Branch Manager, he is also the Mayor"
