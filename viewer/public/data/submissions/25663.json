Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the handling and compression of natural gas.  As part of the facility operation, natural gas liquid (NGL) is separated from the natural gas stream, stored under pressure on site, and sold to a petroleum refiner.  The NGL is the regulated flammable mixture at the facility and contains methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, pentane and isopentane.  These regulated flammable chemicals have a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds each.  The maximum stored quantity of the flammable mixture at the facility is approximately 57,000 pounds stored in one 12,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum fill level of the tank is 90% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a pressure regulator and pressure relief valves.  The facility is normally unoccupied.      \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon"

      "SummaryText": "storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The maximum quantity of NGL released would be approximately 57,000 pounds.  Using the RMP-Comp model, the distance to a 1 pound per square inch overpressure level resulting from the explosion of the vapor cloud is 0.3 miles.  The resulting distance (0.3 miles) extends offsite; however, the facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, and there are no public or environmental receptors within the distance to the endpoint.  The nearest public receptor is located approximately 0.35 miles from the facility.  There was one administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the storage tank is not filled more than 90% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario (e.g., blast wall).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The NGL system was designed and installed and is maintained in accordance with applicable State and Federal requirements.  Employees that may work at the facility participate in a safety training program that includes annual refresher training. \n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There has been no accidental releases of NGL that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.  Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of NGL except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to p"

This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  The facility Emergency Action Plan is reviewed periodically and updated as necessary.\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  There are no specific safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the safety of equipment and procedures."
