      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for National Starch and Chemical Company\nNorth Kansas City - Starch\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nNational Starch and Chemical Company is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass processing corn to manufacture food grade and industrial starch.  We have one regulated substance present at our facilty.  This is propylene oxide.  Propylene Oxide is used as a reactant to modify food grade starches.  The maximum inventory of propylene oxide is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 184,000 pounds.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\nThe Environmental Protection Agency's criteria for worst case scenarios does not allow for active mitigation and requires failure of all safety systems.  To perform the required worst case offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the instantaneous failure of the railcar storage of propylene oxide.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.59 parts per million based on the failure of the railcar  is 1.8 miles.  The affected distance extends beyond our property boundaries and includes residences, schools, hospitals and major office and industrial areas.\n\nThe alternate scenario for Propylene Oxide is a leaking flange on the discharge of the pump.  The leak is detected by the combustible detector after 10 minutes and the system is shut down.  The offsite impact is 0.02 miles and would not impact any residential area.  It could possibly impact a warehouse that is at the fringe of the property boundary.\n\nThe General Accidental Releas"

      "SummaryText": "e Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nNational Starch & Chemical Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazard, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and efficiently controlled.   The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a Hazards Operability Study (HAZOPS).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in safety engineering process chemistry and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.   Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safety conducting activities within our covered processes, National Starch & Chemical Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various models of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  Our facility is ISO certified and the procedures are reviewed as part of the recertification process.\n\nTraining\nNational Starch & Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who operate processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these procedures.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical In"

Process equipment examined during these checks include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at National Starch & Chemical Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at National Starch & Chemical Company.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audit\nNational Starch & Chemical Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nNational Starch & Chemical Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as "

All reports are retained for the life of the process.\n\nEmployee Participation\nNational Starch & Chemical Company believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOur company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  National Starch & Chemical Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazardous related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emeregency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nNational Starch & Chemical Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nNational Starch & Chemical Company has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental release of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAll recommended changes are or improvements documented as a r"
