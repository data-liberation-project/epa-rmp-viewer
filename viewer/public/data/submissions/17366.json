THE FACILITY POLICY: The owners, management and the employees of the Rocky Ford\nGrowers Cooperative Association are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of\nanhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with\nthe local fire company or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION: The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of\nfertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nA. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.\n\nB. The maximum quantity stored would be 84,000 lbs. in our 18,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3. WORST CASE SCENARIO: The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total\ncontents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released\nwould be 84,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent\ncapacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200\nppm is 0.83 miles.)\n\nA. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a\nbreak in a transfer hose. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm is 0.22\nmiles.)\n\n\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:\nThe facility has implemented the previsions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61.1\", published       ~!\n\nby the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the\nstandards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA), 29 CFR,1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n     5. THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:           \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nA. have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor\n\nB. to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations,"

Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and Community Right-To-Know\ninformation as required under\n\n     SARA Title III (EPCRA).  \n\n     7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:   \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.\nPeriodic evaluation are performed to assess the maintenance\nof safe conditions.
