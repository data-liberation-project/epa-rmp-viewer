      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nUnivar Solutions USA LLC, located at 8500 W 68th St, Bedford Park, IL 60501-1844 (0913 Warehouse), is submitting this update to reflect recent changes in facility management personnel and responsibilities.\n\nUnivar Solutions USA LLC, is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a broad range of U.S. industries. Established in 1924, we supply essential chemical raw materials and support services across multiple sectors, including food processing, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas, electronics, and coatings.\n\nThe facility is subject to Federal RMP regulations, and due to the quantities of formaldehyde stored onsite, it is also subject to OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119. The storage and handling of both formaldehyde and cyclohexylamine are managed as part of a Program 3 process. Although formaldehyde qualifies for an exclusion under 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1), Univar has chosen to maintain RMP coverage.\n\nThe RMP and PSM programs are closely aligned to ensure consistency in managing highly hazardous chemicals, enhancing the overall safety and integrity of our operations.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nUnivar\u0092s accidental release prevention program covers all aspects of design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the 0913 Warehouse. This comprehensive approach demonstrates our commitment to minimizing the risk of accidental releases. Additionally, our emergency response procedures have been updated to reflect industry best practices, ensuring effective incident management.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe 0913 Warehouse stores industrial chemicals, including formaldehyde (37% or less by weight) and cyclohexylamine, in 55-gallon containers meeting UN specifications. All storage is indoors, ensuring compliance with safety standards.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC"
