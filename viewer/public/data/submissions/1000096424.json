Communication systems include audible plant alarms, two-way radios, pagers and cellular phones.\r\n\r\nThe facility is a member of the Salt Lake Refiners Mutual Aid organization, which allows each company to borrow resources, such as firefighting apparatus and foam, during an emergency. The facility emergency response teams periodically conduct drills and training exercises with members of the Mutual Aid organization as well as local fire departments.\r\n\r\nThe facility sponsors a CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response) Committee, which is comprised of local city officials and fire, police and sheriff representatives. The CAER Committee meets bi-monthly to discuss citizen concerns about the facility, emergency response efforts and other common community issues. The Davis County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) chairman is a member of the CAER committee.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nWoods Cross Operating LLC will continue to seek improvement in safety for the facility and surrounding community.

The program, which is included in the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), consists of procedures for responding to various emergencies, including chemical releases, fires and explosions. The ICP is designed to manage an emergency situation by setting up effective communications, establishing a management plan, coordinating necessary resources and allowing coordination with any municipal/state/federal emergency response agency that may respond to an emergency at the facility.\r\n\r\nThere are four emergency response teams maintained at the refinery, which consist of volunteer employees: 1) Fire Brigade, 2) Hazmat Team, 3) Technical Rescue Team, and 4) First Responders (medical first aid).

The review and authorization process makes provisions for reviewing the change from several aspects, including the potential hazards, safety and health effects, procedural updates and training requirements. The pre-startup safety review provides a final safety review of the change prior to startup.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity programs are necessary to provide for the on-going integrity of process equipment and instrumentation. Experienced employees and qualified contractors perform maintenance work on the equipment and instrumentation. Inspection and tests are performed in accordance with plant and industry standards and quality assurance is incorporated in new construction and maintenance activities.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigations are valuable learning tools in determining facts regarding incidents and in developing corrective actions to prevent recurrence. The refinery has personnel trained in incident investigation techniques and they are assigned as required to form teams, investigate incidents and report on the findings. The report and any recommendations are then acted on to improve the safety of the unit and the facility\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices at Woods Cross are long-standing practices to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. These are periodically reviewed and updated.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits have been conducted at Woods Cross every three years since completion of the units and are viewed as a way of evaluating the various elements of th"

Some of the more significant opportunities for active participation are Process Hazard Analysis studies, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Incident Investigation, Operating Procedures and Training.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is an important aspect in the operation of a petroleum refinery and Process Safety Information is maintained for safety and operational reasons. The information regarding chemicals, process chemistry and refinery equipment is extensive and is continuously being verified and updated.\r\n\r\nIdentifying potential hazards is a critical element of the safety process at Woods Cross. Process Hazard Analysis studies have been performed on all covered processes at the refinery and are revalidated or redone on a 5 year schedule. Hazard analysis is also performed on changes through the Management of Change process. Recommendations resulting from the studies are addressed and actions taken to address the recommendations are documented.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures have been developed to provide instructions for safely operating the process units. These procedures serve as a consistent basis for training new operators and for reference by experienced operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed, are considered in the management of change process and are annually certified as current and accurate.\r\n\r\nOperator Training is conducted in coordination with the operating procedures. New employees receive foundational training on refinery operations and unit specific training. All operators receive refresher training to ensure operating skills and knowledge are maintained and enhanced. Training requirements are also considered when changes are made to the individual units.\r\n\r\nThe facility uses Contractors to supplement its workforce and because this work is often on or near process equipment, there are specific requireme"
