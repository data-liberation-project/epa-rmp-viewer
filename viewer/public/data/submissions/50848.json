Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is part of Brenntag North America Inc.  Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is an advanced distribution company providing customers worldwide with products, chemicals and advanced materials.  Our major operations are located in the Midwest and employ approximately 240 people.\n\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC (Brenntag) facility, located in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is a chemical distribution facility with an NAICS code of 42469.  Two of the chemicals handled at the facility trigger RMP threshold values.  These chemicals include Toluene Diisocyanate ? Mixed Isomers (TDI) and Cyclohexylamine.  The TDI storage process was previously reported to be a Program Level 1 process.  Cyclohexylamine is being reported in this Risk Management Plan submittal as a Program Level 2 process.  A release of Cyclohexylamine has been determined to be the worst-case release scenario.  An alternative release scenario is also included in this submittal for Cyclohexylamine.\n\nIt is the worldwide policy of Brenntag to design, blend and distribute its products, and to manage those products throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.  This facility participates in the Responsible Distribution Process program of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  The Distribution Process program brings chemical distribution plants and local communities together through communication and cooperative emergency planning.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. \n\nBrenntag safety programs are designed to prevent fires, explosions, and accidental chemical releases.  The program requires safety audits, inspection, maintenance programs, and safety training for empl"

The manuals also include emergency action plans, emergency response plans, and transportation emergency plans.  The facility is in compliance with OSHA regulations.\n\nBrenntag has coordinated emergency response procedures with the Waukesha County - Division of Emergency Management.  These coordination efforts include both RMP chemicals; TDI and Cyclohexylamine.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP Submit Users Manual 2004, the following elements and their descriptions have been included in this Executive Summary:\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBrenntag is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as; design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the various processes at the facility.  It is Brenntag's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Brenntag has thoroughly coordinated response efforts with the Menomonee Falls Fire Dept., which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Brenntag facility?s primary activities encompass distribution of chemical products.  There are currently two regulated substances present at the facility.  These substances include Toluene Diisocyanate ? Mixed Isomers (TDI), and Cyclohexylamine.  The TDI "

Five-year Accident History\nBrenntag has had zero accident releases in five years at this facility, with the exception of a TDI release/injury that occurred in April of 2007.  A Brenntag employee was completing maintenance on an empty TDI cylinder that still had remaining residue inside.  After forgetting to relieve any built up pressure from the cylinder, the employee opened the bottom plug and was sprayed in the face with TDI residue.  The employee had forgotten to wear his full face respirator that was supplied to him, which he had used on a regular basis during maintenance of these cylinders.  The injury that occurred included irritation to his eyes and respiratory system.  The employee immediately washed his eyes in the company eye wash station.  Eye washing continued in the ambulance and at the hospital.  Oxygen was also administered at the hospital where he was kept overnight for observation.   \n\n5.    Emergency Response Plan\nBrenntag has a written emergency response plan in place to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes that take place within the processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan has been reviewed, coordinated and verified with Waukesha County - Division of Emergency Management, which is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n6.
