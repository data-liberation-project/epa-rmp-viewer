      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Foremost Farms USA Cooperative approaches chemical hazards seriously, devoting staff and management at the plant, as well as the corporate level.  Foremost Farms is committed to safety for employees, the public, and the environment and strives to meet all appropriate federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations.    \n\nForemost Farm Appleton facility is located at 1815 West Spencer Street, Appleton, Wisconsin.  The facility manufactures dairy products including cheese and whey products.  Raw milk is trucked to the facility and stored in silos.  The milk and finished cheese products are refrigerated using an ammonia refrigeration system (ARS).  Anhydrous ammonia has been used as a refrigerant by the food industry for decades.  An ARS contains ammonia in various states including liquid, vapor, and gas in various vessels, compressors, condensers, pipes, and evaporators.  \n\nOn June 26, 1996, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68).  The intent of the Rule is to prevent accidental releases of toxic substances and to identify potential impacts to public and environmental receptors.  This Rule requires that covered facilities develop and implement a Risk Management Program.  40 CFR 68 regulates anhydrous ammonia when used in a process at amounts greater than the threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the ARS was calculated at 9,760 pounds, slightly less than the 10,000-lb. threshold quantity (TQ) that triggers the regulatory compliance requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  Since the quantity in the ARS is an estimate subject to many variables and there are nearby public receptors, Foremost Farms voluntarily decided to implement OSHA PSM elements and comply with EPA Risk Management Program.  No other processes or regulated substances at the Facility are covered under OSHA PSM or EPA Risk Man"

      "SummaryText": "agement Program. \n\nForemost Farms has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and is part of the community-wide Emergency Response (ER) Plan.  These programs are designed to meet the requirements of the following:\n\n? 29 CFR 1910.119 (n) - Emergency Planning and Response\n\n? 29 CFR 1910.38   (a) - Emergency Action Plan\n\n? 29 CFR 1910.38   (b) - Fire Prevention Plan\n\n? 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) - Emergency Response to Hazardous Substances\n\nThe Risk Management Program rule requires that a covered facility evaluate two ammonia release scenarios, the \"worst-case\" release and an \"alternative\" release.  The worst-case release for the Foremost Farms plant is the loss of the ammonia in the high pressure receiver vessel at maximum capacity.  The alternative release scenario is a cracked coil.  Given the safety precautions at the plant and state of the art ARS equipment, both releases are unlikely.  If a release occurred , however, the alternative scenario would be more likely.  Both ammonia releases were modeled with EPAs RMP Comp software(version 1.06) and Ammonia Guidances.  Both the worst case and alternative releases result in off-site impacts.  \n\nAs mentioned above, releases from the ARS are unlikely.    Foremost Farms complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (the PSM Standard) to reduce the possibility of accidental release of highly hazardous chemicals. The PSM standard  (29 CFR 1910.119) is designed to protect employees by preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Facilities using a regulated substance (i.e. ammonia) in excess of a regulated (TQ) are required to develop and implement a PSM program. The OSHA PSM standard can be used to satisfy the prevention program element of EPA's Risk Management Program.  The PSM standard addresses the following 12 areas of the prevention program: \n  \n? Employee Participation\n? Process"
