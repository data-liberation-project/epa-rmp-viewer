      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHEP Javelina Company, LLC has demonstrated in its 32 years of operation a commitment to safety and compliance as related to plant personnel, neighbors, and environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources that are invested in facility maintenance and capital improvements, accident prevention, personnel training, and emergency response preparedness. Safety is of prime consideration in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of all processes and equipment. Javelina's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and to be prepared to respond quickly and effectively to any releases which may occur.   Detailed procedures designed to fulfill this policy are found in the following documents:\n\n-    Javelina Plant Emergency Action Plan\n\n-    HEP Process Safety Management Manual\n\n-    HEP Safety Procedures Manual\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nJavelina is a refinery off-gas (ROG) processing facility. Refinery off-gas is produced as a by-product of several refining processes and is typically burned as fuel gas or flared. Javelina recycles the more valuable components of the gas while returning a methane rich fuel gas to the refineries. Javelina produces purity hydrocarbon products, hydrogen used by refineries to treat fuel products to meet required sulfur specifications, and olefins used in downstream chemical and plastics manufacturing. Each of the six refineries in the Corpus Christi area produce off-gas, but not in sufficient volumes at each refinery to economically justify individual ROG facilities like Javelina. In addition to economic benefits, the Javelina plant adds stability to operations and reduces emissions from all the Corpus Christi refineries by providing a steady heating value fuel gas that has a reduced olefin and sulfur content.  \n\n\n\nJavelina is capable of processing approximately 140"

Javelinas product streams are hydrogen, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butane/natural gasoline. \n\n\n\nThe Javelina facility does not contain any toxic chemicals listed in 40 CFR A?68 above the threshold quantities. The facility does not store large quantities of regulated flammable substances, but the processing equipment does contain several of the regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantities listed in Table 3 of A?68.130. These substances include butane (mixture of n- butane and isobutane), ethylene, propylene, ethane, propane, hydrogen, and methane.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario at the Javelina facility involves the release of a mixture of ethane and ethylene from the C2 Splitter. The C2 Splitter is a fractionation tower designed to separate ethylene from ethane. It is 276 feet tall, 12? feet in diameter, and contains approximately 280,000 lbs of an ethane/ethylene mixture (30% ethylene, 70% ethane) at maximum liquid height. For the worst case analysis, this entire quantity was assumed to be released as a vapor over a ten minute period, with a resulting vapor cloud explosion.\n\n\n\nUsing the equations from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (equation C-1), the distance to 1 psi overpressure is calculated as 2,800 feet (0.53 miles) from the source.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected for the Javelina facility involves an ethylene leak due to a flange separation on the suction side of the ethylene product pumps. This leak was assumed to release 16,500 pounds of ethylene over a ten-minute period. Although the ethylene in the plant is a liquid at this point, it was assumed to instantly vaporize for the purposes of this analysis. The resulting vapor cloud was assumed to ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nThe distance to 1 psi overpressure for this scenario was al"

The distance to a 1 psi overpressure is calculated as 735 feet (0.14 miles) from the source.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Javelina accident prevention programs encompass four different areas: design, operation,\n\nmaintenance, and auditing. The facility is subject to the OSHA PSM regulations and has developed  a program to maintain compliance with those regulations. Some of the elements of the Javelina accident prevention program are outlined below.\n\nDesigning for Safety\n\n-    Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity\n\n-    Flammable gas and Hydrogen Sulfide monitors provide early warning in case of leaks\n\n-    Vessels are equipped with level, pressure, and temperature alarms\n\n-    Pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves to prevent overpressure\n\nOperating Safely\n\n-    Operators are trained, tested, and qualified according to Occupational Safety & Health     \n\nAdministration standards\n\n-    The process is continually monitored by computerized control systems and operators\n\n-    Operational procedures are based on Process Hazards Analyses\n\n-    Operators follow approved procedures\n\n-    Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted before starting new or significantly modified equipment\n\n\n\nMaintaining the Plant\n\n-    Maintenance personnel are trained, experienced, and qualified\n\n-    Maintenance personnel are an important part of the plant safety programs\n\n-    A work order and permit system is used to control maintenance work on process equipment\n\n-    Preventative inspection and testing of critical equipment is performed on a scheduled basis\n\nAuditing Operations\n\n-    Safety audits are conducted periodically\n\n-    Safety meetings are conducted at least monthly\n\n-    Safety equipment is inspected monthly\n\n-    Accidents are investigated and correc"

Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Javelina emergency response program can be divided into two components: preparation and response. The elements of each of those components are briefly described below.\n\nTraining and Preparation\n\n-    Plant emergency response plan is in place and updated as necessary\n\n-    All employees are trained for their role in the emergency response plan\n\n-    The City of Corpus Christi Fire Department provides primary response capabilities for the facility\n\n-    Refinery Terminal Fire Company will respond if required to back up Fire Department personnel\n\n-    Drills are conducted periodically and critiqued\n\nResponse\n\n-    Sensors detect the leak and notify control room personnel\n\n-    In-plant emergency alarms are activated by personnel in the control room\n\n-    Video cameras covering all process areas allow assessment of leak without personnel exposure\n\n-    Operations personnel will assess the situation and request assistance from Corpus Christi Fire Department and/or Refinery Terminal Fire Company if the situation warrants\n\n-    Operations personnel will notify public safety providers and local emergency management who will inform citizens by various means.\n\n-    Operations personnel will attempt to isolate the source of the release and with perform a plantwide emergency shutdown if isolation cannot be safely achieved\n\n-    If outside assistance has been requested, operations personnel will establish a command center upon arrival of the fire department\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Javelina accident prevention policies currently in place include provisions to continually review and update those policies as new information becomes ava"

Information sources include PHA revalidations, accident (and near-miss) investigations, new regulations, review of incidents at other facilities, etc. No major changes are currently planned for Javelina's safety policies, but the policies will be continually fine-tuned to minimize the risk to employees and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\n-    The Javelina facility underwent a thorough inspection-driven turnaround in 2019. The approximately $20MM effort included complete replacement of all cryogenic aluminum heat exchangers, internal inspection of several pressure vessels and exchangers, functional testing of all plant shutdowns, and a large piping replacement scope.\n\n-    A complete upgrade of plant control systems is planned for 2022-2024 at an estimated cost of $5MM. The original DCS control and PLC systems including those that control process sequences, interlocks, and shutdowns will be replaced with modern equipment. This effort includes major controls design improvement and alarm management efforts expected to improve operability and process safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
