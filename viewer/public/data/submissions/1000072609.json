This commitment is demonstrated by the resources that are invested in facility maintenance and capital improvements, accident prevention, personnel training, and emergency response preparedness. Safety is of prime consideration in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of all processes and equipment. Javelina's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and to be prepared to respond quickly and effectively to any releases which may occur.   Detailed procedures designed to fulfill this policy are found in the following documents:\r\n-\tJavelina Plant Emergency Action Plan\r\n-\tHEP Process Safety Management Manual\r\n-\tHEP Safety Procedures Manual\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nJavelina is a refinery off-gas (ROG) processing facility. Refinery off-gas is produced as a by-product of several refining processes and is typically burned as fuel gas or flared. Javelina recycles the more valuable components of the gas while returning a methane rich fuel gas to the refineries. Javelina produces purity hydrocarbon products, hydrogen used by refineries to treat fuel products to meet required sulfur specifications, and olefins used in downstream chemical and plastics manufacturing. Each of the six refineries in the Corpus Christi area produce off-gas, but not in sufficient volumes at each refinery to economically justify individual ROG facilities like Javelina. In addition to economic benefits, the Javelina plant adds stability to operations and reduces emissions from all the Corpus Christi refineries by providing a steady heating value fuel gas that has a reduced olefin and sulfur content.  \r\n\r\nJavelina is capable of processing approximately 140"

Javelinas product streams are hydrogen, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butane/natural gasoline. \r\n\r\nThe Javelina facility does not contain any toxic chemicals listed in 40 CFR A\u00a768 above the threshold quantities. The facility does not store large quantities of regulated flammable substances, but the processing equipment does contain several of the regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantities listed in Table 3 of A\u00a768.130. These substances include butane (mixture of n- butane and isobutane), ethylene, propylene, ethane, propane, hydrogen, and methane.\r\nWorst Case Scenario\r\nThe worst case scenario at the Javelina facility involves the release of a mixture of ethane and ethylene from the C2 Splitter. The C2 Splitter is a fractionation tower designed to separate ethylene from ethane. It is 276 feet tall, 12\u00bd feet in diameter, and contains approximately 280,000 lbs of an ethane/ethylene mixture (30% ethylene, 70% ethane) at maximum liquid height. For the worst case analysis, this entire quantity was assumed to be released as a vapor over a ten minute period, with a resulting vapor cloud explosion.\r\n\r\nUsing the equations from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (equation C-1), the distance to 1 psi overpressure is calculated as 2,800 feet (0.53 miles) from the source.\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nThe alternative release scenario selected for the Javelina facility involves an ethylene leak due to a flange separation on the suction side of the ethylene product pumps. This leak was assumed to release 16,500 pounds of ethylene over a ten-minute period. Although the ethylene in the plant is a liquid at this point, it was assumed to instantly vaporize for the purposes of this analysis. The resulting vapor cloud was assumed to ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.\r\nThe distance to 1 psi overpressure for this scenario was al"

The facility is subject to the OSHA PSM regulations and has developed  a program to maintain compliance with those regulations. Some of the elements of the Javelina accident prevention program are outlined below.\r\nDesigning for Safety\r\n-\tMaterials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity\r\n-\tFlammable gas and Hydrogen Sulfide monitors provide early warning in case of leaks\r\n-\tVessels are equipped with level, pressure, and temperature alarms\r\n-\tPressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves to prevent overpressure\r\nOperating Safely\r\n-\tOperators are trained, tested, and qualified according to Occupational Safety & Health     \r\nAdministration standards\r\n-\tThe process is continually monitored by computerized control systems and operators\r\n-\tOperational procedures are based on Process Hazards Analyses\r\n-\tOperators follow approved procedures\r\n-\tPre-startup safety reviews are conducted before starting new or significantly modified equipment\r\n\r\nMaintaining the Plant\r\n-\tMaintenance personnel are trained, experienced, and qualified\r\n-\tMaintenance personnel are an important part of the plant safety programs\r\n-\tA work order and permit system is used to control maintenance work on process equipment\r\n-\tPreventative inspection and testing of critical equipment is performed on a scheduled basis\r\nAuditing Operations\r\n-\tSafety audits are conducted periodically\r\n-\tSafety meetings are conducted at least monthly\r\n-\tSafety equipment is inspected monthly\r\n-\tAccidents are investigated and correc"
