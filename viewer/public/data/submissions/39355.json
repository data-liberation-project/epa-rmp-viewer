The mixture is used as a propellant for aerosol paint cans.\n\nFinished goods are transferred to the warehouse for interim storage.  Mixtures of propellant, flammable liquids, and paint solids are stored in 12- or 18-ounce cans.  Approximately 1,000,000 pounds of propellant may be stored in the well-protected warehouse at any one time.\n\nPropellant is a flammable and potentially explosive gas.  The propellant is not inherently toxic.\n\n2.0 POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n2.1 WORST-CASE SCENARIO\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, a worst-case release from the largest single container was analyzed to assess the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint.  This facility only stores 12- and 18-ounce cans of finished goods and has no associated process piping or vessels, therefore the worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios would be the same.  The release scenarios analyzed and the endpoints evaluated are based on the guidance contained in the USEPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities (the \u00bfPropane Guidance\u00bf), dated March 4, 1999, and the USEPA\u00bfs Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (\u00bfOCAG\u00bf), dated April 1999.\n\n3.0 ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of propellant at the Rust-Oleum Pleasant Prairie warehouse in the last 5 years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site; or off-site death, injury, property damage, evacuation , sheltering in place, or environmental damage.\n\n4.0 PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAlthough a formal, documented prevent"

      "SummaryText": "ion program is not required by the RMP rule for Program 1 processes, a number of design and operational controls are in place to decrease the severity or prevent the occurrence of a fire or explosion.  The most significant controls are described below:\n\n  The warehouse is designed as an aerosol warehouse in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products code (NFPA 30B).\n\n  Aerosol storage is limited to two pallets high within the warehouse.\n\n  All electrical equipment meets the requirements of the National Electric Code (NFPA 70).\n\n  The warehouse is fully sprinklered using an early suppression fast response system.\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Rust-Oleum, Pleasant Prairie facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, including incidents related to a release of propellant.\n\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for plant employees, coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of personnel in the facility.  The EAP identifies specific individuals and their responsibilities, and identifies procedures for emergency medical care.\n\nAdditionally, the Rust-Oleum manufacturing facility, located near the off-site warehouse, has a trained and well-equipped hazardous material response team that would also respond to a hazardous material situation at the warehouse."
