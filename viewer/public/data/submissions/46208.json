      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nRMP program for Marlboro Paper Mill\nWeyerhaeuser Co., Marlboro County, S.C.\n\n1.0  Facility Background\n\nWeyerhaeuser Co. owns and operates a fully integrated pulp and paper mill located in Marlboro County along the Great Pee Dee River about five miles west of Bennettsville, SC.  The location of the mill is in a rural, agricultural setting with a low population density..  The topography of the surrounding countryside is generally flat.  The largest nearby town is Bennettsville, SC located five miles east of the mill.  Bennettsville has a population of about 10,000.  The paper mill is called the Marlboro Paper Mill \"Marlboro Mill\"). \n\nThe mill employs both technically advanced processes as well as a non-traditional, highly educated, non-union work system.  In most ways, the mill is considered to be state of the art.  The mill produces different grades of hardwood and softwood market pulps as well as various grades of printing, copier, and writing papers.   \n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWeyerhaeuser is committed to the safety of the Marlboro Mill employees and the general public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Marlboro Mill utilizes reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, Marlboro Mill controls and contains, to the extent possible, releases in a manner that emphasizes safety for employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  In addition, the Marlboro Mill will investigate incidents soon after they occur to determine the root cause(s) for the incident and develop plans to ensure that the incident does not occur again. \n\n3.0  RMP Applicability\n\nThe Marlboro Paper Mill incorporates three processes that contain or use chemicals in a stored volume that causes those processes to be covered under the RMP program, 40 cfr 68 (and O"

      "SummaryText": "SHA's PSM program as well).  The three processes include a  a Sterling R-10 process that manufactures ClO2, and two raw water Cl2 treatment processes.  The Sterling R-10 system  supports the bleaching operations of the pulp mill, while the two raw water treatment processes serve to disinfect incoming river water from the Great Pee Dee River.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It is important to note that since the mill's start up in 1990, two past RMP processes have been retired and are no longer listed as active systems.  One, the Lurgi ClO2 system was shuttered in early 2006 because it was no longer economically feasible to operate this system.  The two Lurgi ClO2 storage tanks are now piped into the Sterling ClO2 system and are included with the Sterling  covered process.  The actual Lurgi process is now shut down.  In addition, the chlorine unloading and distribution system has been de-listed since the mill no longer receives chlorine railcars.  High volume chlorine shipments (i.e., railcars) were required since chlorine was a component of the Lurgi process. The chlorine unloading system included railcars, vaporizers and distribution piping.\n\n4.0 Overview of Covered Processes and Off-Site Consequence Analyses\n\nThe mill has completed off-site consequence analyses as required by the regulation.  However, due to regulatory changes enacted in 2004, there are no specific or detailed discussions of OCAs in this section other than to acknowledge completion of the OCA.  \n\n5.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWillamette's Marlboro Mill takes a proactive view of preventing incidents related to releases of hazardous chemicals.

The policy manual is reviewed and revised as necessary to ensure that the mill complies with both rules.\n\n\n5.1 Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information consists of many different types of information related to hazardous chemicals and the processes that contain them.  Types of information that are available to all employees and contractors include MSDSs, Chemical Control Information, PSM/RMP files,  Engineering files, process specific safety information, and Willamette Engineering standards.  \n\nMSDSs are available in hard copy in one central mill location, but available to all mill employees through a software system called Dolphin.  This ensures quick and efficient retrieval of relevant MSDSs.  Hard copie of the MSDSs are also located locally in Bennettsville at the Fire Department, LEPC, Hospital, and local company Doctor.  MSDSs are updated periodically.    In addition, information from MSDSs is entered in a chemical control spreadsheet where all pertinent safety, hazard, and disposal information is kept.  The chemical control information is located in the Technical Services Department. Special designated PSM/RMP files have been established to house all relevant information regarding PSM/RMP.

All engineering files and vendor equipment files and information is located in a central mill engineering library.  The library is accessible by all mill personnel.  In addition, Weyerhaeuser has corporate engineering standards to be used during the design phase of projects. \n\n5.2  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nPHAs are conducted on all covered RMP/PSM processes at least every five years.  All covered systems in the mill have had at least one PHA completed.  The Hazard and Operability (HazOp) technique is used to complete the PHA.  The teams which comprise PHA teams meet the requirements of PSM/RMP both in terms of quality and quantity of personnel.  PHAs are filed in the mill PSM/RMP file system.\n\n5.3 Standard Operating Procedures\n\nThe mill has implemented SOPs in every operating area, including the three RMP covered processes.  In every way, SOPs are a part of the Marlboro Mill culture and not just part of RMP.  SOPs consider the correct operating procedures and techniques for equipment and processes, consider safety risks and precautions, include  job safety analyses (JSAs), establish normal operating ranges and targets, incorporate start up and shut down procedures, and are established for maintenance activities.  SOPs are routinely updated through the Technician review process.  This frequent review results in SOP continual improvement.  Knowledge and demonstration of skills required by SOPs is a part of a Technician's promotion process.  Many  SOPs consider safe work practices such as fall protection, hot work permit requirements, confined space entry requirements, lock out/ tag out procedures, and hole watch responsibilities.  \n\n5.4  Training\n\nAll new Marlboro Mill employees go through PSM/RMP training as part of their new employee training process.

In addition, training for all affected teams occurs after an incident investigation is completed in their business unit.  The objective is to ensure that all teams receive and understand the outcome of the incident investigation.  All training events are documented and filed with the mill's training coordinator who then archives all training activities.  In addition, written tests are generally given for the annual and every three year training events.  This ensures employees retain information presented during the training sessions.\n\n5.5  Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Marlboro Mill uses a computer based maintenance system, called SAP, to manage maintenance and mechanical integrity activities.  All response maintenance work orders as well as preventive maintenance inspection work orders are entered through SAP.  In addition, after the work order is completed, the results of the work, particularly for PM inspections, can be stored in the SAP system.  This allows for a good mechanical integrity history to be compiled for all equipemnt.  In addition, the SAP system is able to rate the priority of work requests by the priority rating which has been assigned to each process.  By using this system, all PSM/RMP covered processes receive the highest rating allowing prompt response to mechanical and maintenance issues as they arise.  Last, the SAP system is able to generate inspection work orders for covered processes based on  a predetermined frequency.  This allows for vendor required routine inspections to take place on the prescribed frequency.\n\n5.6 Management of Change (MOC)\n\nThe Marlboro Mill has implemented an MOC system for all covered processes such that any proposed change or modification to a covered process must first be reviewed for process safety considerations.

All MOC requests are documented and filed in the RMP/PSM file system.   In addition, any PSI or engineering documentation change required because of an approved MOC are noted on the MOC form for follow up.\n\n5.7  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nPSSRs are conducted for any startup of projects that occur within the boundary of a covered process or after a major maintenance outage.  The PSSR is conducted by operating, maintenance, engineering, and process controls personnel to ensure that all systems are verified safe prior to starting up.  PSSR forms are used to facilitate the PSSR as well as document the PSSR.  PSSR will verify that the physical system is as engineering drawings indicate, that valving and physical controls are set according to SOPs, and that process controls are operating per the design.\n\n5.8  Compliance Audits\n\nFormal compliance audits are conducted on an every three year basis per the requirements of PSM and RMP.  These audits can be third party audits and are used to uncover and correct program deficiencies.  The last third party audit was conducted in 2006.  Recommendations stemming from the audit are categorized, prioritized, and assigned to individuals to complete.  In addition, internal audits are conducted periodically to uncover soft spots in the program.   \n\n5.9  Incident Investigation\n\nAfter each incident or near miss in a covered process, a formal incident investigation will occur.  The incident investigation uses a team approach where a technical facilitator (the Tech Services Manager or designee) will facilitate a group of persons investigating the incident.  The group will always include operating technicians and managers associated with the incident, process controls personnel, process and project engineers, and maintenance personnel.  \n\nThe investigation objective is to identify incident root cause(s) as well as surface c"

In addition, the investigation and results are shared with each operating team in the affected business unit (training) with the meeting being documented.  \n\n5.10  Employee Participation\n\nActive employee participation is essential to the success of the RMP program.  Employee participation minimizes the consequences of releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Communication is encouraged between and among all levels of the organization.  To promote and incorporate safety as a part of our business culture, at a minimum, monthly safety meetings are required for all mill employees.  These safety meetings are documented for each employee.  In adddition, the mill has implemented a central safety committee with millwide representation to set goals for safety performance as well as implement safety initiatives.  Next, each mill business unit has its own safety committee which develops safety goals and expectations for that business unit.  The business unit's safety goals support the mill's goals while tailored to meet specific department needs.    In addition, daily safety meetings and discussions are held within each operating and support team in the mill on a daily basis.  Millwide goals and safety results are communicated on a broad and frequent basis ensuring that all employees are aware of mill and department safety results.                                                                                                      \nThe mill also employs a PSM/RMP steering team to review and manage PSM/RMP program activities.
