ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWe at the Seneca Foods Facility in Glencoe, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, emergency shut downs, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of an incidental release.  We also notify and coordinate response efforts with the Glencoe Fire Department providing emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Seneca Foods'Glencoe facility is a seasonal vegetable plant.  We process canned and frozen peas and corn. Ammonia is refrigerant used to process and store these vegatables.  We have approvimately 86,000 pounds of ammonia on site to handle processing and cold storage.\n\n\n3.  WORST CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWe utilized [ALOHA(R)] for the worst case release and alternative scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  \n\n\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary step to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention progrom this is in place at our facility.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION- The Seneca Foods' Glencoe facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operatiing parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.  This can be found in this facilities Process Safety Management.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANLAYSIS-  Our facility condu"

Areas covered include preventive maintenance, trouble shooting, theory, safety, design, standards, operating levels, to name a few. \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY-  Mechanical integrity begins in the planning and design process of any portion the system. This is to make sure that sizing of piping, vessels, electronic components and controls, safeguards (relief valves, cutouts, structural barriers...), building construction and design, ventilation are correct for any type or specific application in the system. This includes documentation of the previously mentioned areas including certifications where applicable. The maintenance and preventative maintenance programs used to ensure that all potential concerns of safety and operation are addressed and corrected in a very timely manner.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE-   Written procedures are in place at this facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.
