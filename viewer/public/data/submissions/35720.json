      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION:\nThe Peace River/Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority (herein referred to as Authority) operates a water treatment plant located in the southwestern part of DeSoto County.  The plant provides potable water to commercial and domestic customers, as well as water for use in fire protection.  \n\nChlorine gas is used as a disinfection agent at the facility due to its disinfection qualities, ease of use, and low operating costs.  The Authority stores up to 22,000 lbs of chlorine at the facility at any one time.  It is stored in two (2) locations at the facility.  The first is a semi-enclosed area, which has been used for many years.  The actual injection of the chlorine from this storage area takes place within a sealed building at the facility, which services approximately 50% of the facility's treatment capacity.  The second storage area is an enclosed building, where injection also takes place, and services the remaining 50% of the facility's treatment capacity.  A security fence surrounds the entire facility and individual fences surround the chlorine storage areas.  Plant operations involving the use of chlorine are handled by personnel trained in the use and handling of chlorine and chlorine containers.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & POLICIES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM & POLICIES:\nResponsible storage, use, and handling of chlorine and chlorine containers drive the Authority's policy on handling the substance.  Established chlorine procedures minimize the exposure risk to employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  Facility managers mandate a team concept consisting of at least two employees, to instill a safety first mindset at the facility.  In part, many of the facility's procedures are derived on the most stringent requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management rule. \n\nThe facility's accidental release prevention program minimizes the likelihood and impact of accidental releases.  Elements include"

      "SummaryText": "regular reviews of operations and maintenance procedures as they pertain to the handling and use of chlorine, compliance reviews, hands-on employee training, management of change, and an extensive safety program.  \n\nRecent updates to the facility's Emergency Response Plan were made recently as a result of the facility's Vulnerability Assessment.  The plan outlines various emergency procedures based on several emergency scenarios.  The plan has been coordinated with DeSoto County (DC) emergency officials, and DC Fire Rescue and Sheriff's Office are the designated first responders to all emergency calls from the facility.  Mutual aid agreements are also in place with the Charlotte County Fire Rescue Department should they become necessary.  The response team performs coordination of response, public communication, recovery and cleanup activities. \n\nThe emergency response program is designed to ensure a prompt response and mitigation in the event of an emergency situation.  Elements include regular communication and interaction with first responders and emergency officials, plan and program reviews, as well as exercises to evaluate response capabilities.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nOver the last five (5) years, the facility has not experienced an accidental release of chlorine. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nDue to the facility's excellent safety record with respect to the handling and use of chlorine, no changes to improve safety have been identified.  The facility continues to maintain a vigilant stance through continual process review and safety procedures to keep employees and the surrounding community safe from chlorine exposure."
