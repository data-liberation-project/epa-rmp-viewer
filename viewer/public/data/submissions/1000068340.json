Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at George's, Inc. Further Processing Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Poultry further processing.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for our refrigeration process.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario to perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used RMP*Comp.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the RMP regulations promulgated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency the facility determined that its worst-case release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration system would be the loss of the contents of its largest liquid ammonia containing vessel, which is a high pressure receiver located outside of the processing plant.  Under normal operating conditions, this receiver contains a liquid level of approximately 25%.  However, during pump-downs, which occur approximately 0-2 times per year for system maintenance and repair, the high pressure receiver can hold up to 100% liquid, an amount that is limited by administrative controls.  Using the parameters set forth in the RMP regulations, and using RMP*C"

      "SummaryText": "omp the worst-case release toxic end point would travel 2.6 miles off-site and potentially reach nearby receptors.  The worst-case release scenario takes into account that the release would occur outside but assumes that no active mitigation measures are taken.\n\n\n\nAn alternative release, most likely release, was also examined and is documented in the plan.\n\n\n\nGeorge's Further Processing alternative release scenario, defined in the RMP regulations as a scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario and which will reach a toxic endpoint off-site assumes a release from ruptured liquid inlet flanges to a spiral freezer coils leading to an airborne release of ammonia liquid and vaporization.  Under normal operating conditions and average weather conditions (wind at 3 m/s from the east south east) and for the urban topography where the facility is located, the predicted endpoint is 0.1 miles.  There are zero public receptors located with the distance to toxic endpoint which could be affected by a release.  These calculations were determined by process knowledge, system understanding, industry release history, system design information, and MARPLOT.  The alternative release scenario takes into account that the release would be inside of the building.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nGeorge's, Inc. Further Processing Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes."

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a \"What If\" scenario.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations. The program is examined and changed as necessary.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, George's, Inc. Further Processing Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nGeorge's, Inc. Further Processing Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMaintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations are documented.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at George's, Inc.
