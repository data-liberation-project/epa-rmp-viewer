      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATE\nCITY OF LYNNWOOD WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\nEPA FACILITY ID #: 1000 0016 6223\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\na) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) having more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine on site is required to have a Risk Management Plan.  Chlorine is an integral part of the WWTP disinfection system, being necessary for public sanitation and for protection of the waterway (Puget Sound) into which the treated effluent is discharged.  At the same time, the properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in order to prevent any threat to WWTP personnel and the nearby residences of Lynnwood's service area.  It is the policy of the City of Lynnwood to adhere to all applicable federal, state, county and local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which WWTP staff handle chlorine, the secure devices in the design of the chlorine handling system, and the on-going safety training of the WWTP personnel.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) was prepared by Prezant Associates in conjunction with the Lynnwood Fire Department, and WWTP personnel.  HDR Engineering developed the Chlorine System Process Safety Management Plan (PSM).  Both plans have been reviewed and updated by Lynnwood Engineering Staff and WWTP personnel.\n\nb) Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nThe Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Plant is responsible for domestic and commercial wastewater collection, treatment and disposal within the service boundaries.  The treatment facilities are intended to protect the public health and the beneficial uses of the waters in the area.  The facility reduces the suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the influent sewage.  The wastewater passes through several processes to remove these pollutants; chlorination is utilized to reduce the disease-causing constituents of the sewage.  T"

      "SummaryText": "he treated wastewater is discharged into Puget Sound while the resulting sludge is disposed of by incineration.\n\nA maximum of 12,000 pounds, (6 one-ton cylinders), of chlorine can be stored at the Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nc) Release Scenarios\n\n* Worst-Case:  The EPA has defined the worst-case scenario as the total loss of the largest container on site in a ten minute period, with an atmospheric stability F, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.  For the Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Plant a 2000 pound cylinder is used, there are no passive controls, and the terrain is urban.\n\n* Alternative Scenario:  A more likely scenario would be for the 3/8\" steel line connecting the ton cylinders to the header pipe to break.  This would allow chlorine gas to escape into the atmosphere until the valve at the tank was shut off by plant personnel or the Haz-Mat team from the Fire Department.  For this scenario it is assumed that the pipe breaks letting chlorine gas escape, it takes the Fire Department one hour to shut the valve.  An atmospheric stability D, wind speed of 3 meters per second, urban terrain, and temperature of 25(C were assumed.  The leak is in an enclosed room.\n\n* Controls and Mitigation:\n\n1) All Chlorine cylinders are located inside of a locked chlorine storage room.  No cylinders are stored outside.  All handling of the one ton cylinders is done directly between the delivery truck and trunnions upon which the cylinders lie.\n\n2) An overhead I-Beam and trolley system is used to move the cylinders from the delivery truck to the trunnions.  The I-Beam and trolley system are inspected and tested regularly.\n\n3) The chlorine cylinders are strapped down to prevent movement in the event of an earthquake.\n\n4) The chlorine storage room has continuous air monitoring with a chlorine leak alarm that sounds at 2.0 ppm.  The alarm is tested monthly.\n\n5) In the event of a chlorine alarm, the Lynnwood Fire Department Haz-Mat Team "

They also have the ability to spray a curtain of water protecting from gaseous chlorine.  Additionally in conjunction with the Lynnwood and Edmonds Police Departments they have a plan to notify the surrounding affected neighborhoods.\n\n6) There is a large window in the chlorine room delivery doors that allows for continuous visual inspection of the chlorine cylinders.\n\nd) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis program is covered under separate regulation, Process Safety Management (PSM) which was developed by HDR Engineering for the City of Lynnwood.  Hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and compliance audits are all covered in this program.  The program was reviewed and updated by City Engineering and WWTP personnel.\n\ne) Five Year Accident History:\n\nThe Lynnwood Wastewater Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine.\n\nf) Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an Emergency Response Plan for several years with the most recent revision done in December 2001.  The response plan for a chlorine leak depends upon the severity of the leak.  Trained WWTP personnel are responsible for containing miniscule leaks.  Response to a large leak or an uncontrolled leak becomes the responsibility of the Lynnwood Fire Department.  New WWTP employees are not allowed to work on processes involving chlorine until they have had adequate training.\n\nAll operations and maintenance personnel shall receive annual chlorine handling and emergency response plan refresher training.  Classroom and/or hands-on training session duration is listed below.\n\n\nChlorine emergency response procedures                        2 hours"

The alarm warns plant personnel to evacuate.  The chlorine alarm sends a signal to Washington Alarm, an off-site monitoring company, who contacts the Lynnwood Fire Department.\n\ng) Planned Changes To Improve Safety:\n\nReplaced overhead crane in June 2009."
