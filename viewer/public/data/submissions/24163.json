Reactions with bromine, chlorine, fluorine, iodine, gold, silver or mercury can form potentialy explosive mixtures.  Ammonia bulk storage tanks are stored where the tanks are not directly adjacent to other chemicals.  Concrete pylons have been placed around the tanks to prevent them from being accidentally struck.  A physical safety inspection is conducted monthly.  If corrosion is noted, valves are replaced.  Tanks are painted as scheduled.  Two tanks are in place although only one is utilized.  The tank is only filed to 85% capacity and if aproblem should occur with one tank, the chemical can be transferred to the adjacent empty tank.  Sensors are in place in the ammonia feed area to monitor alarms.  Employees can be notified of a leak via audible alarms, panic pager and control panel through the S.C.A.D.A. system.",

      "SummaryText": "Kentucky-American Water Company operates two water treatment plants in Fayette County, Kentucky. The water treatment plant at the Kentucky River Station uses chlorine and ammonia along with some other less hazardous chemicals to disinfect and to produce 45 million gallons of water per day. The maximum quantity of chlorine that is stored at the Kentucky River Station is 28,000 pounds, with an average quantity of 20,000.  We have the ability to store a maximum quantity 55,000 pounds of ammonia, with an average quantity of 23,000. The distance to endpoint before the chemicals would be dispersed would be three miles for chlorine and four miles for ammonia.   It is the intent of Kentucky-American Water Company (KAWC) to protect its associates as well as the communities it serves from the dangers that are associated with hazardous chemicals.  In order to achieve this goal at KAWC, specific controls, policies and procedures are in place to prevent and/or to minimize the risk to the community.  The Company communicates its goals and provides the local emergency planning committee and the fire department with information pertaining to the chemicals that it uses.  Fire department personnel and employees from the City of Lexington, Division of Environmental and Emergency Management periodically visit the treatment plants to become familiar with the processes and the chemicals used, in order to respond to chemical emergencies.  During 2000 the Water Company completed the installation of a chlorine scrubber at the Kentucky River Station plant.  The scrubber is designed to contain a leak of liquid chlorine to prevent the release and exposure to the Company's associates as well as to the general public.  In the event of a release, Water Company personnel would attempt to close valves and take other steps in accordance with the established Company policies and procedures.  If a leak cannot be contained, personnel will begin a notification process, which would include the notificati"
