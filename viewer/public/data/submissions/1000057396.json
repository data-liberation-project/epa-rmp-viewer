Use of these chemicals is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management (RM) Planning regulations (40 CFR, Part 68) herein referred to as the RM regulations.  Under the CAAA and the RM regulations, this facility is considered to be a stationary source.\n\n\n\nThere are 3 processes within the Golden Brewery Business Unit that require a Risk Management Program:\n\n1.    Brewery ammonia refrigeration process - 473,810 pounds on site\n\n2.    Water plant chlorine disinfection process - 8,000 pounds on site\n\n3.    Golden Distribution Center ammonia refrigeration process - 18,500 pounds on site\n\n\n\nThis document addresses the five EPA regulatory requirements for a RM Plan, which form the basis of the RM program for the Golden facilities.  EPA's five key regulatory requirements for a RM program are:\n\n\n\n1.    Management Plan\n\n2.    Hazard Assessment\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n4.    Emergency Response\n\n5.    Risk Management (RM) Plan and Data Elements\n\n\n\nThis RM plan is summarized below.\n\n\n\nRequirement 1.  Management Plan\n\nThe facility has a program in place to manage the implementation of the RM program elements.  The program is under continuous review and improvement with the objective to reduce release risk.  The program engages operations personnel through the employee participation process described in the PSM Program Manual.  All changes are subject to rigorous review prior to approval and implementation following the Management of Change Process also described in the PSM Program Manual.  Compliance with program elements is subject to auditing processes.  Corrective actions are implemented to address audit findings. \n\n\n\nRequirement 2.  Hazard Assessment\n\nPotential accidental releases of ammonia and chlorin"

Modeling procedures followed EPA guidance to identify worst case release scenarios (WCS) and alternate case release scenarios (ACS) as defined by the RM regulations to determine toxic endpoints for the three processes.  The toxic endpoint for each scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp.  The estimate of impacted populations within the area of the toxic endpoint was modeled using Marplot.  Both of the modeling programs are supplied by the US EPA.

Security sends a trained officer to the scene to assess the situation, act as the initial Incident Commander, and engage the proper internal and external emergency response personnel and equipment in accordance with National Incident Management System (NIMS) requirements and guidelines.  When external emergency responders are needed, a joint command is then established which is led by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) and supported by MC personnel.  The AHJ can call additional external emergency response resources to the scene including City of Golden Fire Department, Fairmont Fire Department, West Metro Fire Department, the Jefferson County Sheriff, Colorado State Patrol, Jefferson/Adams County HAZMAT Team, and other agencies, as needed.\n\n\n\nRequirement 5.  RM Plan and Data Elements\n\nThe specific data elements required to be electronically reported to EPA are included in Section 5.0.  The data elements are supported by this RM plan which documents and provides additional details for each RM regulatory requirement.  Section 5 consists of a complete printout from EPA's RMP Submit software.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Improvements\n\n\n\nAmmonia utilization is being reduced.  As a result, equipment no longer required to be used is being isolated and piping is cut and capped. \n\n"
