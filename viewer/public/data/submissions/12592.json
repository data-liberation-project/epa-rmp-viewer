      "SummaryText": "King County West Point Treatment Plant\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nThis summary describes the Risk Management Plan for the King County West Point Treatment Plant, a publicly owned wastewater treatment facility.  The plan was prepared to meet federal EPA requirements stated in Section 112r of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 68 which is commonly known as the Risk Management Program.  It describes the chemical systems that fall within this regulation, and explains King County's policy and procedures for preventing chemical accidents and preparing to respond to accidents in order to protect our employees, community and environment.\n\nBackground\nThe West Point Treatment Plant is a wastewater treatment facility located in Seattle, Washington.  It is owned and operated by the King County Wastewater Treatment Division.  The plant was originally built by Metro (Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle), began operating in 1966, and became part of King County in 1996 when Metro and King County were merged.  The plant serves 700,000 residents within a 280-square mile service area that is located on the west side of Lake Washington extending from South Snohomish County to South King County.\n\nThe West Point Treatment Plant is charged with transporting and treating the area's wastewater in order to protect the public health of the community and to preserve the water quality of Lake Washington and Puget Sound.  It accomplishes this by collecting the area's wastewater, removing pollutants contained in it, and disinfecting the clarified wastewater prior to discharge into Puget Sound.\n\nWastewater Treatment Process and Chemicals \nWastewater collected from the service area enters the West Point Treatment Plant and is progressively cleaned by going through three stages of treatment.  The first two stages, called preliminary treatment and primary treatment, are physical processes that remove floating material, heavy solid material such as sand, and about two-thirds of the organic material.

      "SummaryText": "tewater then moves on to secondary treatment, a biological process that uses naturally occurring microorganisms to remove organic pollutants from the wastewater.  After this biological step, the wastewater is clarified, disinfected, and discharged.  The entire treatment process is designed and operated to meet EPA's water quality requirements for discharge into Puget Sound.\n\nSolid materials removed from the primary and secondary treatment processes are transferred into an enclosed tank and combined with another set of naturally occurring microorganisms that break down or digest the solid matter.  The digestion process produces a by-product called \"digester gas.\"  Digester gas is mostly composed of methane, a gas similar to natural gas.\n\nThree chemicals at this treatment plant are listed in the Risk Management Program.  The first chemical, chlorine, is used to disinfect the wastewater prior to discharging it into Puget Sound.  Chlorine is also occasionally used in small amounts to control odors generated at the treatment plant.  Methane, a component of digester gas, is the second chemical.  Digester gas is collected from the digestion process and is used at the treatment plant as a fuel to run boilers and wastewater pumps.  Digester gas is also used to run generators which produce supplemental electricity on-site.  Propane, the third chemical, is stored in a 30,000 gallon tank as a backup fuel and is used when there is insufficient digester gas to run critical pumps and boilers.\n\nThe West Point Treatment Plant recently completed a major construction project to expand its capacity and improve its systems.  The construction included replacing the old  chlorine and propane systems with new, state-of-the-art equipment, and significantly improving the digester gas system.\n\nRisk Management Program\nThe Risk Management Program requires that hypothetical worst-case and alternative release scenarios be prepared for each listed chemical.  The regulation defines the worst-case s"

The worst-case scenario assumes that the following occurs simultaneously:  the entire quantity of the largest container in a system is quickly released;  weather conditions are at its worst-case;  electronic control systems and active chemical scrubbing systems are not operating;  and response procedures are not used to prevent or minimize the release.  For the chlorine system, the worst-case scenario is considered to be the release of the entire contents of a single one-ton cylinder.  The liquid spill and vaporization release would be lessened or mitigated by the building that encloses the chlorine system.  This release could potentially reach areas outside the plant.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a hypothetical and virtually impossible chain of events.  Our chemical systems normally have multiple and redundant safety systems such as containment structures, control systems, neutralizing systems and emergency procedures to prevent or minimize the extent of accidents.  Further, the laws of physics would prevent such rapid evaporation and release rates.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is also a hypothetical situation, though it is based on more realistic circumstances where the nature of the accident is selected from analyzing the system, weather conditions are typical for the facility's location, and automatic control systems and safety systems operate as intended to minimize damage if there is an accident.  For the chlorine system, the alternative release scenario is considered to be the failure of a fuseable plug in a one-ton chlorine cylinder which could cause up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine to leak out of the cylinder.  The scenario also assumes that the chlorine building's active chlorine scrubber isn't operating, however, the chlorine building enclosure would mitigate the leak.  This release could potentially reach areas outside the plant.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for propane is consid"

This release could reach areas outside this facility.  An alternative release scenario for propane would involve a release of the same quantity of propane and ignition of the plume, which could also affect areas outside this facility.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the digester gas process (a flammable mixture) is considered to involve a release and vapor cloud explosion of 6,700 pounds of methane, the maximum quantity of methane contained in the digester blend tank.  This release could potentially affect areas outside this plant.\n\n20 Years of Safety\nThe West Point Treatment Plant has been operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week since 1966.  It has had no reportable accidents in the past five years and no major accidents of chlorine, digester gas or propane in over 20 years of operation.  We are proud of this safety record and attribute it to a multi-pronged accident prevention approach which includes a well-designed facility, well-trained and knowledgeable employees, and a philosophy to continually improve our operations.\n\nKing County's policy is to meet or exceed all regulations that apply to our wastewater treatment facilities;  this policy extends to the Risk Management Program.  Our systems are designed and operated according to regulations, industry standards, and sound engineering practices.  Multiple levels of protection are designed into our systems to prevent accidents and minimize effects in case of an accident.  These layers of protection typically include a combination of the following:  equipment and piping that are designed with safety factors to safeguard against material failure;  monitoring and alarm systems to warn plant operators and automatically startup safety systems if there is a problem; systems such as isolation valves, and scrubbers to neutralize chemical releases;  and contain"

The chlorine scenarios described earlier assumed that the chlorine scrubber wasn't operational.  Under normal conditions, the chlorine scrubber is on standby and ready to operate at any time.  Any chlorine leak would cause the scrubber to start up and neutralize the leak so that it is unlikely that chlorine would be released into the environment.  The digester gas system has a sophisticated control system and sensitive audio and visual gas detection alarms to notify plant operators if there is a gas leak.  The propane system also has an automatic control system, alarms, gas leak detectors, and a deluge system to rapidly douse the tank in case of an accident.  The plant has a scheduled preventive maintenance program, and our maintenance employees are trained and skilled to keep all equipment operating properly.\n\nThe best way to assure safe operations is to have well-trained, knowledgeable employees.  All of our plant operators are licensed and certified by the State of Washington.  All other plant employees such as the maintenance, laboratory and process control staff are trained to perform their work in a safe manner.  Training and refresher classes are taught regularly to keep skills updated.  Employee safety is a top priority at the King County's treatment plants, and the plant's philosophy is to continually improve safety in operations.
