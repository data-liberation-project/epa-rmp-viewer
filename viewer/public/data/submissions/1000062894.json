The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:  \n\nThe Linde Gas North America, LLC facility located in Blythewood, SC, complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency accidental release was to occur involving our propane or acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Blythewood Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency. In addition, each employee is trained monthly on safety policies and procedures. Employees also participate in Quarterly Safety Committee meetings for the facility. Hazards identified during the meetings are corrected accordingly.\n\n\n\n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Linde Gas facility manufactures and stores acetylene. Acetylene is put into storage cylinders of various sizes  \n\nbefore they are sold and shipped from the facility. The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process\n\nconsists of chemical acetylene trailers, a medium pressure acetylene generator, and a high pressure cylinder\n\nfilling area.\n\nAcetylene is compressed using chemical acetylene stored on trailers that have acetylene cylinders manifolded\n\ntogether. The piping from the manifold runs underground to the northwest corner of the plant, and then\n\nruns above ground to the generator and compressor room. The supply lines are equipped with pull away\n\nprotection, flow reducing pressure regulators, 1.2\" orifice plates, large flash arrestor, and check valves to\n\nprotect against reverse flow.\n\nThe generator is piped to the compressors which are housed in the same room as the generator.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Linde Gas facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and\n\nlocal codes and regulations.
