There are also water monitors surrounding the drums that would be used to knock down vapors from any spill.\n\n-    As with other chemicals of concern, ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic shut-off and relief devices to handle fluctuations in temperature and pressure.  Warning alarms, regular equipment inspections and pressure monitoring in pipes and vessels provide layers of protection for employees and the community.\n\n-    The formaldehyde storage tank is equipped with a spill pit to contain the contents of any accidental liquid releases.  A monitor nozzle is in place to control vapor releases from the tank.  Automatic shut-off devices, relief valves and safety alarms proved additional protection.\n\n-    Chemical flammability is a great concern for BASF, and many steps are taken to prevent accidental releases.  Thermal relief and automatic shut-off system are incorporated into process designs.  Systems are in place to quickly relocate or dispose of propylene in emergency situations.  Continuous monitoring of pipe and vessel pressure identifies potential leaks for further protection.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases over the past five years which meet the reporting criteria.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEmergency response programs are in place for both internal preparation and coordination with the community. The Freeport Site plan is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure community safety. Drills are coordinated with the community and the community warning sirens "

      "SummaryText": "are tested weekly.  In the event of an incident, information is transmitted over a local radio station. BASF participates in the Industrial CAER program (Community Awareness and Emergency Response), which operates a hotline for communication with the community.  In addition to the site plan, each operating unit has a block specific emergency plan.  These plans contain information specific to chemicals within the unit.  Incident commander training is conducted annually. Information on emergency health care is incorporated into the emergency plan. BASF also maintains a corporate-wide Emergency Response Team that is expertly trained in emergency mitigation techniques for transportation and off-site incidents.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, etc.\n\n"
