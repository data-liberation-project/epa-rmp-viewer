They are based on the U.S. EPA RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, which defines the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint that serious injury from short-term exposure will no longer occur.  \nHydrogen Chloride (HCl) is received in anhydrous bulk form via truck.  The HCl is contained in seven separate pressurize tubes with each tube containing 3000lbs.  The IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) value for HCl is 50ppm and was used as the value to calculate the endpoint for the rupture of one of the tubes.  Other parameters utilized in the worst-case scenario analysis are in the following table.\n\nParameter\tValue\nRelease duration (min)\t10\nStability class\tF\nWind speed (m/s)\t1.5\nAnemometer height (m)\t10\nAmbient temp (oF)\t109\nRelative humidity (%)\t65\nSurface roughness (m)\t0.3\nReceptor height (m)\t0\n  \nThe distance to the endpoint in this scenario is 1,573 meters, which has off site impact and is indicated on the supplied map.   Using the EPA\u00bfs \u00bflevel of concern\u00bf (LOC) value of 0.03 mg/liter for HCl which equates to 20ppm the end point for the release would be between 3,900 and 5,500 meters.  \nAn alternative toxic scenario for HCl was performed using the 500 lb \u00bfY\u00bf cylinder.  The \u00bfY\u00bf cylinder is used as the HCl source during change out of the tube trailer.  Besides the amount of HCl released, the other input parameters changed were stability class from F to D and wind speed from 1.5 to 3 m/s.  The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 485 meters, which also has off site impact.  (see map) \nTrichlorosilane (TCS) is also received in bulk form via truck.  The TCS is in liquid form and is contained in a 3800gallon (43,000lbs) ISO container.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nGLOBITECH INC.\nSHERMAN TEXAS\nJULY 2003\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\tGlobiTech Incorporated is a 120,000-square-foot semiconductor facility located in Sherman Texas.  Sherman is located 60 miles north of Dallas Texas in Grayson County.  Construction began in February 2000 and the plant was occupied in July 2001.  The facility consists of a two level administration area located between two wafer fabs.  The fabs are made up of three levels.  The first level contains the chemical delivery systems and related support equipment for the process tools.  The middle level of the wafer fab is an 8000-square-foot class 1 clean room environment containing the manufacturing process equipment. The third level houses the air handling system for the facility.  Behind the administrative area on the first level is more support equipment such as chiller, boiler, and deionized water manufacturing.  Behind the administrative area on the second level is the main frame computer room and wafer stock room.  Located outside are storage tanks for the deionization water process, Acid Waste Neutralization system, hydrogen, and nitrogen storage tanks (both cryogenic).  Also located outside are the bulk supply and distribution systems for anhydrous hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane.  Both of these chemicals are scheduled to be located on site in quantities above threshold limits thus prompting implementation of OSHA\u00bfs PSM and EPA\u00bfs RMP.  At this writing, Fab 1 has been completely facilitated and is in production status to approximately 30% volume capability.  Fab 2 is built to the basic structure level (iron and concrete) but no clean room construction, support equipment, or air handling equipment is in place.  The product is epitaxial deposited silicon wafers.  Production began in late 4Q2001.  \n\n\nProcess Description\n\tA thin (2-30 micron) single crystal layer of silicon is deposited on a silicon wafer.  The end product is an ultra pure starting substrate for use by integrated de"

      "SummaryText": "vice manufacturers called wafer fabs to build integrated circuits commonly referred to as chips.  Trichlorosilane is the source material for the \nsilicon deposition.  The deposition process takes place at elevated temperatures high enough to separate the silicon atoms from the chlorine atoms contained in trichlorosilane. The process takes place in what is known as an epi reactor.  Hydrogen chloride is used on a periodic basis to remove silicon that has deposited on equipment piece parts during the reaction. Hydrogen chloride is the major byproduct of the deposition process and the periodic cleaning.  It must be scrubbed (treated) to state mandated levels before emission into the atmosphere.   An air permit from the state regulatory body, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), was obtained prior to construction of the facility (permit 42019).  GlobiTech is labeled a \u00bfminor source\u00bf in regard to emissions due to the very small amount of HCl emitted after scrubbing.   Other processes associated with the deposition are wet cleaning of the wafers and parameter measurement such as electrical resistivity and thickness. \n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nAnhydrous hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane will be the regulated chemicals handled on this site.  Hydrogen chloride in quantities above threshold limits will not be present onsite until all PSM and RMP elements are completely in place.  This is anticipated to be 3Q2003.  Trichlorosilane (TCS) is not anticipated to be onsite until 4Q2003 at the earliest.  However, all program elements of PSM and RMP are being implemented in anticipation of both chemicals being present. \n\n\nWorst Case Disaster Scenario \n\tWorst-case disaster scenarios for both hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane have been performed. An independent environmental consulting firm with extensive expertise in dispersion modeling performed the analysis.  The techniques used were consistent with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and The U.S."
