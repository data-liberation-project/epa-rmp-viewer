We have written procedures for changing chlorine cylinders, loading and unloading chlorine cylinders, and a emergency responce plan.  All personnel are trained in the proper handling of chlorine and any unsafe actions are not tollerated.  Plant management personnel are commited to having a safe environment, any equipment problems are immediatley fixed.  The chlorine system is inspected thoroughly on a monthly basis and is visually inspected daily. Our facility is a municipal waste water treatment plant. Waste water arrives at our plant through a sewer line, it is then distributed into two equal aeration basins where biological treatment takes place.  The treated sewage then goes to a water clarifier where the solids and liquid are seperated. The solids are disposed of and the water goes on to final treatment. Final treatment of the water includes clorination.  Chlorine gas is mixed with water, this sollutionis then injected into a basin with the clean water from the clarifier.  The chlorine solution mixes with the water for approximately 30 minutes to destroy any bacteria.  The chlorinated water is then discharged into Dye Creek.  \n     Our facility is located in a rural area.  According to the OSHA guidelines using the RMP Comp, the worst case scenario with offsite impact would be as follows; a 2000lb cylinder leaking 200lb per minute for 10 minutes would have a toxic end point of 3 miles.\n     Steps have been taken for general accidental release prevention.  We have gone through Process Safety Management and our employees are trained in the safe handling of chlorine.  The chlorine is stored in an area that is safe from vandalism and exposure to extreme heat.  The chlorine feed system is based on a vacuum principle which stops the release of chlorine in case of a line break.  The chlorine hoist system is inspected monthly and the chlorine feed equipment is serviced only by qualified con"

A Police, Fire, and  Hazmat team will be dispatched by the 911 system.  If community evacuation is needed it will be handled by qualified professionals.\n     We plan to have the complete chlorine feed system replaced by 7-01-99.  We feel that replacing our current equipment with new technology will improve safety and efficency."
