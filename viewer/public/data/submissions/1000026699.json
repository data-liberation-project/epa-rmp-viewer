There are three products at this location which fall under the risk management plan requirements. These products are methyl chloride, ethyl chloride and ethylene. The toxic and flammable characteristics of these products make it necessary to observe certain precautions when handling these products. There are three different processes, yet the safe prevention practices are similar in nature. Overall, the prevention of exposures and reducing the threat to associates personal health as well as reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations. It is Airgas Specialty Gases policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which products are handled and re-packaged, combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided to all personnel responsible for the use of the systems. Associates conduct proper start-up procedures for these processes. The gas systems must start with the proper setting and securing of trailers utilizing wheel chocks, warning signs, and grounding equipment. Once this is accomplished, they can hook-up all items necessary to off-load gases at the facility. Visual tanker checks including but not limited to tare weight, ownership stamp, valve threadings, etc. are completed prior to use. Written policies and procedures for all gases are followed each day. Maintenance if necessary is contracted out to pre-qualified companies who have trained personnel in the proper maintenance of these systems. The mechanical integrity of the systems is maintained in accordance with all good engineering practices. Contractors have access to the O&M manuals for all systems. This facility has a Process Safety Management plan which is being incorporated int"

They also have a Safety Management System in place that includes items such as Lock-out/Tag-out, Hazard Communication, Contractor Safety, etc. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan in place to aid in the prevention of accidental releases and natural disasters that may affect the facility. The Harris County-South Houston LEPC and the Houston Fire Department have been provided copies of this plan. If a release were to occur at this location, associates would be notified of the release by activation of the audible alarm and muster at the evacuation point for a head count and notify the Houston Fire Department if necessary.  If the operator of the system in question is unable to mitigate the release using manual valves, the emergency shutdown system will be utilized to turn off all electricity to the pumps and components of the systems to prevent any further operation of pumping equipment. If the release cannot be mitigated safely notification shall be made to the Houston Fire Department by calling 911. The Houston Fire Department will respond to a release at this location and are trained in Haz Mat operations. This facility has a toxic and flammable worst case scenario. The toxic worst case scenario for a toxic release would be the failure of the vessel storing methyl chloride. This release, if the vessel were full, would have a release of 40,000 pounds of methyl chloride. Active mitigation was considered for this release, including excess flow valves, and manual shutoffs. Passive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. The distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 1.3 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered urban (Industrial). This release scenario could impact approximately 4,532 persons in a 5.3 square mile radius.

Active mitigation was considered for this release, including excess flow valves and manual shutoffs.  No passive mitigation was considered.  The distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 0.3 miles.  The area surrounding the facility is considered to be urban (industrial).  This release scenario could impact approximately zero persons in a 0.3 square mile area.  This information was determined using RMP*Comp and Landview 6 software. An alternate toxic release of methyl chloride from a transfer hose would be the most probable release for this location. The transfer hoses at this location are stainless steel. Over time the hoses could begin to wear, which could lead to a small hole in the transfer hose. If this were to happen with the methyl chloride, an estimated release rate would be approximately 40 pounds per minute for 10 minutes. This 400 pound release would have a toxic distance to endpoint of less than 0.1 miles. Within this small area there would be approximately 0 persons affected. There are no residences in this area so the numbers would be the surrounding office/manufacturing facilities. An alternative flammable release of ethylene from a PRD (pressure relief device) would be the most probable release for this location.  Ethylene is filled into DOT approved high pressure steel vessels equipped with DOT approved valves and PRDs (pressure relief devices). Cylinder/tube trailer valve PRD's generally are the weakest point of the package and if there was a release it most likely would occur at the PRD. If this were to occur an estimated release would be approximately 32 pounds per minute.  This release would have a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.  Within the area there would be approximately zero persons affected.  There are no residences in this area and the surrounding area is comprised of off"
