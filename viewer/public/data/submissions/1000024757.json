      "SummaryText": "GENERAL\n\nLion Copolymer Geismar, LLC (Lion Copolymer) manufactures EPDM rubber (Royalene and Trilene) as well as chemical foaming agents (CELOGEN OT and AZ).  The facility began operations in 1962, and Lion Copolymer purchased the facility in June 2007.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe facility has been a member of the Ascension Parish CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response) program since 1985.  This organization is part of an on-going effort to maintain communications between industry and the general public with the appropriate law enforcement, emergency response personnel, and environmental agencies. This program integrates well with the existing Geismar Plant Emergency Response Procedures, which are contained in the Geismar Policy Manual and include:\n\n     Bomb Threat,\n\n     Disaster Notification,\n\n     Release Reporting Procedures,\n\n     Incident Command/Planning and Response,\n\n     Assistance and Notification for Serious Injury,\n\n     Electrical Power Curtailment,\n\n     Gas Release Procedure,\n\n     Hurricane Preparedness,\n\n     Geismar Mutual Aid,\n\n     Plant Fire Brigade,\n\n     Riot and Civil Disturbances,\n\n     Steam Usage Curtailment,\n\n     Tornadoes,\n\n     Community Inquiry,\n\n     Security Reporting,\n\n     HAZWOPER Safety and Health Plan, and\n\n     Unusual Incident Reporting.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Geismar Facility handles five RMP chemicals (three toxic and two flammable) with quantities above the regulation threshold.  Whenever possible, chemicals are handled by pipeline to reduce the impact in the event of a leak rather than stock-piling large amounts in storage tanks.  The RMP covered processes are Program 3 PSM processes that include raw material receiving, storage and handling and as such are controlled by all of the above-mentioned \"prevention\" and \"emergency response\" programs.  The chemicals of concern are discussed below.\n\n\n\nTOXIC:  Anhydr"

      "SummaryText": "ous Ammonia and Hydrazine (as Hydrazine Hydrate) are unloaded into storage tanks and are used in the manufacture of chemical foaming agents which produce foaming action in sponge products and agricultural products.  In the ROYALENE production process, the facility also utilizes  Alkyl Aluminum, which is regulated under the LDEQ Supplemental List of the Louisiana RMP regulation.  The RMP eSubmit Program does not allow this chemical to be entered; therefore it is not included in the submittal file.  This chemical is associated with a Program 3 PSM process and is included in the Executive Summary for documentation. \n\n\n\nFLAMMABLE:  Propylene is used as a refrigerant in the ROYALENE production units.  A flammable mixture comprised of propylene, ethylene, propane, and ethane is contained in the ROYALENE and TRILENE production units.  Propylene and ethylene are used as raw materials and are delivered to the facility via pipeline.  Ethane and propane are generated during the reaction process from the ethylene and propylene.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe requirements in the RMP regulation to prevent accidental releases are being met at the Geismar facility by established programs which include:\n\n     Operator training and certification,\n\n     Work Permits,\n\n     Hazard Communications,\n\n     Management of Change for Process and Equipment,\n\n     Process Hazard Analysis,\n\n     Reports of Unsafe Conditions,\n\n     Safety Orientations,\n\n     Emergency response training,\n\n     Routinely updated operating procedures,\n\n     Computers and computerized control systems,\n\n     Emergency control / shutdown devices / interlocks,\n\n     Equipment / piping safety controls,\n\n     Warning alarms,\n\n     Regular safety checks, and\n\n     Equipment inspections.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nLion has not had an accidental release in the last five years that has resulted in an onsite death, injury or significant property damage, or an "

      "SummaryText": "offsite death, injury, evacuation, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency situation, the Geismar plant has a certified team of medical first responders and onsite response tools to handle an environmental situation as per 1910.120(q).  Also, on site, is a fully equipped exterior, industrial fire brigade, a confined space/high angle rescue team, a HAZMAT/Incident Command team and trained Incident Commanders.  These teams are regularly drilled to handle fire fighting situations, confined space extractions and chemical release containment.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Geismar Plant is registered to the ISO 14001 international environmental management standard and is also an OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star facility.  As part of these programs, the facility has committed to continual improvement of its environmental health & safety programs.  As an example, this RMP Plan submittal is being updated in 2011 to account for removal of an RMP regulated substance from the site, which has eliminated a toxic alternative case scenario.  Lion Copolymer's position has been and continues to be one of maintaining the safety of its employees and the general public.  \n\n"
