Statement of Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this Plan is to identify those incidents, such as fire, explosion, spills or air pollution releases that would effect the surrounding community and guide the response to any such occurrence.  Plant personnel are trained properly to deal with specific emergency response situations.  This Plan is written in compliance with the Risk management Programs under Clean Air Action Section 112(e)(7).  This location is covered by this regulation because Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) is stored and processed at the Resin plant.\n\nThis Plan is designed for the employees of Glidden, Emergency Responders and the general public, and contains details of specific response actions and reporting procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency.  This Plan is the primary source of information necessary to notify local, State and Federal agencies for offsite releases of Vinyl Acetate Monomer.\n\nThis plan is supported of various procedures contained in the Glidden SPCC Plan, Health and Safety Operating Manual, Emergency Response Team Manual, Emergency Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan, the Plant Process Safety Program and various other plant operations manuals.\n\nB.Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nVAM is delivered to the site on railcars which may be up to 30,000 gallons in capacity.  It is stored in two 15,000 gallon tanks prior to being pumped to the Resin plant for processing.  VAM is pumped from the storage tank into a weight tank or reactor vessel inside the plant.  The reaction converts all the monomer into a non-hazardous polymer (latex).\n\nC.Worst Case Scenarios\n\nOnsite locations (\"processes\") involving VAM include:\n\n\n\n1.An outside rail siding for 30,000-gallon tank"

      "SummaryText": " car shipments, approximately 600 feet from the nearest offsite building, and 300 feet from the nearest (west) fence line.\n\n2.Two outside 15,000-gallon storage tanks, in a diked area just north of the rail siding, approximately 330 feet from the nearest (west) fence line.\n\n3.A 6,000-gallon reactor inside a process building.\n\n4.A 2,000-gallon weigh tank inside a process building.\n\n5.A 20-foot high, 4-inch transfer pipeline, almost 400 feet from the nearest offsite building, and 300 feet from the nearest fence line.\n\nA worst case release is defined as instantaneous loss of the largest full vessel in each affected process onsite.  For RMP purposes, only that release resulting in the largest offsite Area of Concern needs to be considered (i.e., the worst of the worst).  Administrative controls such as plant policies limiting vessels to partial filling may be used to reduce release volumes, but active mitigation systems such as control valves may not.  By examination of the site plan, it is clear that the RMP Worst Case Scenario is the loss of a full railcar, which would instantaneously release 30,000 gallons (234,360 pounds) of VAM.  A railcar is the largest single vessel, there are no administrative controls in place that would prohibit a full car, and the cars are typically spotted at least as close to the nearest fence line as any other vessel.\n\nThe RMP Guidance specifies that atmospheric release (evaporation) rates must be calculated  assuming that the released material spreads to an unconfined depth of 1.0 cm, unless passive mitigation such as diking limits the area covered by the release.  Since the railcar area is unconfined, this assumption was adopted.  The evaporation rate at 25 C is then calculated as a function of vapor pressure (114 mmHg), release area, and windspeed, which for subsequent dispersion modeling is set at 1.5 m/sec (3.4 mph).\n\nThese values are directly input to the vapor dispersion algorithms in each respective model.  Per the RMP Guidance, wor"

Per the AFTOX User manual, the ground was assumed to be wet, which is supposed to increase dispersion distances; and surface roughness was set at 10 cm, which is appropriate for essentially open, flat terrain with scattered small trees and buildings.  The distance to the endpoint concentration of 260 mg/m3 is 6,758 feet.\n\n\n\nD.Accident Release Prevention Program\nThe facility achieves compliance with the accidental release prevention requirement through our OSHA PSM process.  Critical components of the process are as follows:\n\nPART 1910.119(c)  EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe facility has had a Process Safety Management Employee Participation Policy in place since April 1993.  The policy discusses employee participation in such areas as: hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, incident/accident investigation, emergency planning and response, safety and health committees and I.Q. teams.\n\nPART 1910.119(d)  PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe requirement to maintain information pertaining to the hazards of highly hazardous chemicals is met through the use of MSDSs.  Per the standard this is an acceptable practice provided certain information is contained in the MSDS.  Information pertaining to the technology of the process can be found in the reactor procedures for the Resin Plant and the batch slip for the Specialty Coatings Plant.  Additionally, to meet this requirement the facility conducts Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS) to determine the consequences of deviations, including safety and health concerns.  Information pertaining to the equipment in the process is maintained by the Plant Engineer.  P&IDs exist for all regulated processes in the Resin and Specialty Coatings Plants. Additionally, there are individual dossiers on all pieces of critical equipme"

Maintenance of critical pieces of equipment is monitored through theMP2 System.\n\nPART 1910.119(e)  PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe facility has conducted an initial process hazard analysis of the Resin Plant, excluding the thermal oxidizer, in September 1993.  The Specialty Coatings Plant was completed in the second quarter of 1996.  The facility uses HAZOP methodologies in conducting the hazard analysis.  The hazard analysis is conducted by a team of employees with expertise in engineering and process operations and the team leader has had formal hazard analysis training.  As a result of the study, a list of recommendations are developed.  The recommendations are sent to the appropriate Plant Superintendent and are followed up on by the Safety and Health Supervisor.  Documentation of the hazard analysis and recommendations are kept on file in the SHE Department.\n\n\n\nPART 1910.119(f)  OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Resin Plant has a complete set of operating procedures for processes regulated under the standard.  The operating procedures contain sections on steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems.  In the Resin Plant these procedures are kept in the Control Room for Operators and in the lunchroom for Assistant Operators and Material Handlers.  In addition to the operating procedure the facility maintains a set of Safety and Health operating procedures that address such issues as: Lockout/Tagout; Confined Space Entry, Security, Laboratory Operations and Contractor employees.\n\nPART 1910.119(g)  TRAINING\n\nAll employees who work in areas covered by the standard have been provided with initial and refresher training.
