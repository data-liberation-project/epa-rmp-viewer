Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Our facilities have written emergency response plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation on many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility is a methanol production process.  The regulated substance handled is methane.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario does not affect off-site public receptors, therefore, this facility is classified as Program One.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. \n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with writt"
