      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nReal Alloy has implemented a Risk Management Program in accordance with the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. In the event of an emergency, Real Alloy has\n\ncoordinated emergency response efforts with the Coldwater Fire Department and the City of Coldwater's Local\n\nEmergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nReal Alloy manufactures aluminum sows and molten aluminum in crucibles from various types of recycled aluminum scrap. At the time of this submittal, Real Alloy is subject to the requirements under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions since the facility maintains chlorine on-site in a quantity greater than the 2,500 pounds threshold. Chlorine is used at the facility to remove impurities from the recycled aluminum.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTo meet the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, Real Alloy has implemented the RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nReal Alloy has developed an emergency response plan in accordance with the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. Additionally, Real Alloy has coordinated emergency response with both the Coldwater Fire Department and the City of Coldwater's LEPC. In the event of an emergency, Real Alloy will follow the procedures outlined in the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nReal Alloy is currently evaluating and processing recommendations from the recent process hazard analysis performed for the chlorine operation.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History \n\nThere have not been any accidents involving chlorine at the facility. \n\n"
