This facility is one of eight other Aluminum recycling plants in the United States owned by Connell Ltd.  As a manufacturer of aluminum ingots its products are sold globally under its corporate company, Connell, Ltd, 1 International Place, Fort Hill Square, Boston Massachusetts.\nSite Description:\n\tThe Wabash Alloys facility is located at 6223 Thompson Road, Syracuse, New York.  The site is approximately 20 acres in size.  The site is serviced with electricity, water, natural gas, and sewer lines.  \n\tThe surrounding vicinity consists generally of residential structures.  \nA 90-ton chlorine tanker car is stationed on the north side of the property.  Access to the property is to the east side with the employee parking lot to the southwest.  The entire site is fenced.\nOperation Description\n\tThe site process involves the sorting, grading, processing (removing organics via a rotary kiln), melting, and alloying of metals for sale.  As part of the sorting process, large aluminum scrap is shredded or crushed, and ferrous metals are removed using a maseparation process.  A dryer with a secondary combustion unit and baghouse is used to remove impurities from the aluminum scrap such as moisture, paints and resins.\n\tThe sorted aluminum is charged into one of four furnaces where the metal is melted.  Once melted, various additives are used to modify the composition and hence the physical characteristics of the metal.  The metal is degassed by bubbling nitrogen through the molten metal.   Magnesium is removed by bubbling chlorine through the melt to form magnesium chloride.  Materials kept on-site for the process are aluminum, magnesium, zinc, copper, silicon, sodium, beryllium, and strontium.  Approximately 8,000,000 pounds of these materials are on-site at any given time.\n\tOnce the molten product is prepared, the melt is either poured and cooled as ingots or sows, or is transferred to heated crucibles fo"

The emissions from the dryer are treated first using a secondary combustion unit, and then with a baghouse.  Emissions from melters, ingot and sow molding processes, and dross cooling operations are controlled using a baghouse.\nChlorine is receives in a 90-ton tanker car via Conrail on the Carrier Spur.  The tanker comes in on the Carrier Spur and must be pulled onto a neighbor's property - Oberdorfer/Citation.  Wabash Alloys has a formal agreement with them.  Delivery is made once every month.  \tWabash Maintenance personnel connect the tanker to a transfer station.  Assess to the connection area is by stairs to a platform.  The connection is made by flexible piping.  The tanker is padded with nitrogen continuously during the transfer.\nThe chlorine is transferred from the tanker car through pipes over the driveway going from North to the South side to a vaporizer room.  A new vaporizer was installed in January 1999.  At each particular furnace the chlorine gas passes a shut off valve, then through another flowmeter, and then through a needle valve where its flow is regulated by the furnace operator to the molten metal pump.  Each inlet line has a pressure sensitive valve which automatically closes if pressure on the gas side decreases.  Also, the nitrogen line is automatically opened to purge the line.  Close to the needle valve is the tubing connection that connects to a carbon lance, which feeds the gas to the pump housing.  Here the chlorine reacts with magnesium and aluminum to demag and clean the aluminum alloy.\nOperation - Connecting 90 ton tanker\n    (1)  Receipt of Chlorine\n     Wabash Alloys receives Chlorine by rail.

This development included a thorough assessment of the process in an attempt to assess the age and present integrity of the component parts.  This assessment included the identification of the component parts for comparison with the manufacturer's specification for maintenance and replacement with like in-kind components on a scheduled basis.

Also, the facility was visity by the Department of Environmental Conservation in 1992..  Health and safety audits are conducted annually by a Wabash Division and the Connell LTD audit team.\nSource Prevention & Emergency Response Approach\n\tDue to the receipt, usage, and storage of Chlorine in large quantities, Wabash Alloys takes a proactive approach to the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment.

The primary methods used by this facility are a part of the Process Safety Management Program as follows:\n\tA.  Written Plan of Action - Process Safety Information.\n\tThis part of the program is one of the most involved and included the development of a written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program.  In accordance with a specific schedule outlined by the standard, as per 29 CFR 1910.119, Wabash Alloys has completed a compilation of written process safety information concerning the process and operations involved with Chlorine of these standards of operating procedures.

      "SummaryText": "nder this program, the use of Chlorine in the demagging system has been considered a process, whereas a production or usage system/function is considered an operation.   By identifying each functional operation, a team was able to ascertain the potential and develop preparation plans in the case of a release.  This compilation of information is to enable Wabash Alloys and the employees involved in the operations related to Chlorine to identify and understand the hazards posed by these processes.  This process safety information includes information pertaining to the toxicological and physical hazards of the chemical listed.\n\tB.  Hazard Analyses/Abatement Schedule.\n\tThis analysis is the heart of Wabash Alloys ' process safety management or Risk Management release prevention program.  The safety and health staff, engineering and maintenance personnel, and certain operational personnel performed an initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) on each operation within the chlorine process.  The analysis was completed by a team with expertise in the operations.  The team included employees who have experience and knowledge specific to the operations of handling and using the chemicals at each of the process operations.  A system was developed and is maintained to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations by the formation of a PSM/RMP committee.  Also, a written schedule of when these actions were to be completed has been developed, indicating by whom and when.  The hazard analyses will be updated as needed and at least every five (5) years.  With the recent changes to the system a hazard analysis was completed.\n\tThis analyses involved a review of each operation of the process to address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  The assessment also included information concerning the emergency action plans related to the process; development and implementation of s"
