The chlorine process is located at the Pre-Treatment Building, which is separate from the treatment plant.\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored in steel one-ton containers in the Chlorine Storage Room, within the Pre-Treatment Building, which is of sound masonry construction.Ventilation is provided at the Pretreatment facility, in both the Apparatus room, and the Chlorine storage room.The fan draws air through the outside air intake louvers.\n\n\n\nThe City of Newark has maintained an \"approved\" Risk Management Plan Program under the New Jersey TCPA regulations for the chlorine process since approximately 1988.  The current City of Newark program includes a complete chlorine safety program including extensive operator training, emergency response training, standard operating procedures and chlorine safety equipment.  The chlorine process includes chlorine monitors, alarms and controls.\n\n\n\nThe City of Newark's written Risk Management Program includes all necessary Prevention Program elements, meeting the requirements of EPA and OSHA Process Safety management.  The Prevention Program includes elements such as safety information, standard operating procedures, operator training, preventative maintenance, hot work permits, and other safety programs to ensure that the chlorine process meets the highest possible safety standards.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, the Pequannock Water Pretreatment facilities has not had any chlorine releases with outside impacts within the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nSodium Hypo on-site generation system is under construction and planned to be online by end of this year (2019).
