(SEUSA) Commerce City Refinery includes a brief description of the following items:\r\n\r\n- The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n- A description of this stationary source and the regulated substances handled\r\n- The five year accident history\r\n- The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\r\n- The emergency response program\r\n- Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nThis risk management plan re-submission for the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery complies with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR 68 as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119. The risk management and process safety management programs for this refining process are applied uniformly to each production unit in the process. This results in one refinery-wide accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nTwo goals for the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery include a 'Journey to Zero' incident mindset, and that we are a welcome business in the community. Preventing accidental releases is an essential component to achieve these goals. The SEUSA Commerce City Refinery uses a variety of activities, as described below in the general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps section, to reduce the chances of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nAn emergency response team of volunteer employees receives annual training in emergency response techniques. This training includes fire fighting techniques. The SEUSA Commerce City Refinery's goal is to be able to respond effectively to any emergencies within the refinery. The emergency response team also trains with other local emergency responders so that both groups are prepared to respond if an event exceeds the refinery's capabilities.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THIS STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nSuncor Energ"

      "SummaryText": "y Inc. is a Canadian company that specializes in mining and upgrading tar sands in the northern area of Alberta, Canada.  This submission treats the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery as a single stationary source process for the production of petroleum fuels.  The refinery produces multiple grades of gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, propane, butane, asphalt components, and sulfur. The refinery produces several regulated flammable substances as products. In addition, some of these materials are used in the various production units. The refinery also has some RMP listed toxic substances, with Hydrogen Sulfide being the only material to exceed threshold quantity specified in the regulation.  Practices are in place to protect employees, the community, and the environment from the flammables and the toxics.\r\n\r\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe RMP requires the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery to report all accidents that had specific on-site, community, or environmental impacts within the past 5 years. There have been no accidents that meet the reporting requirements for this resubmittal. This has been determined based upon the results of interviews with Suncor employees and a review of safety and environmental records covering the five year period prior to the submission date of the RMP.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental release prevention program elements in place at the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery and describes the systems that have been implemented to help prevent accidents.\r\n\r\nManagement Commitment\r\n\r\nSEUSA's Commerce City Refinery management recognizes the value of active, widespread employee participation in the effective application of process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention for the risk management program (RMP).\r\n\r\nEffective process safety management depends upon the knowledge and contribution of every employee involved with the operation"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.\r\n\r\nFor the technology and equipment of the process, written information is collected and validated by a variety of employees. The technology information includes the process chemistry, intended inventories, safe upper and lower limits for such items as temperatures, pressures, flows or compositions, and the consequences of deviation from the limits. The refinery maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, procedures, and protective instrument systems, such as automated shutdown systems.\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and design codes and standards. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to help ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe process hazards analysis is a systematic approach to help ensure that hazards associated with the various production units in the process are identified, evaluated, and controlled. The SEUSA Commerce City Refinery uses recognized methodologies to conduct the analysis, including the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique and a what-if/checklist methodology.

The management of change system includes written procedures that provide for the changes to be reviewed and authorized before being implemented. It includes various evaluation questions that help assess the impact of the change. The proposed change is reviewed by employees to understand the technical basis of the change and any possible impact on safety and health. Once the change is authorized, any affected process safety information (for example, chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information. or procedures) is updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary information or training on the change.\r\n \r\nIf a new process is constructed or if there is a change that requires a change in the process safety information, a review is performed prior to start-up. The purpose of this pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. There are checklists to assist the employees' verification of all aspects of readiness, including field verification of the construction and verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.
