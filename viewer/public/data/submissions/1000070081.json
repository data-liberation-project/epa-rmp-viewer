      "SummaryText": "Overview of Program:\n\n\n\nThe US Amines Portsmouth plant is subject to EPA RMP and OSHA Process Safety Regulations.  We comply with these regulations through our consolidated Process Safety Management Program. We use or produce the EPA-RMP regulated chemicals Ammonia, Ethylamine, and Allylamine at the Portsmouth, Virginia site. We manufacture several different chemicals in the family of amines.  Our products are used to produce agricultural chemicals, water treatment chemicals, engineering resins, and drugs.  We have about 12 company employees and 10 resident contractors.  \n\n\n\nAt US Amines, we are dedicated to being an industry leader in protecting the environment, the health, and safety of both our employees and the communities in which we operate.  Like our community neighbors, the people who work at the Portsmouth site want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why US Amines has a zero safety incident goal.  More details of our Process Safety Management (PSM) program are presented below.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled and Safety Measures:\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used as a raw material. The storage of ammonia and the operations that use ammonia fall under the site PSM program. Ammonia is stored as a liquefied gas. The storage, use, and transfer locations are covered by a selection of automatic and manual fire suppression systems.  Though ammonia is not typically considered flammable, the water systems could be used to dissolve the liquefied gas and absorb the vapors in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nEthylamine is used as a raw material. Operations of the storage locations and the operations that use Ethylamine fall under the site PSM program. The storage, use, and transfer locations are covered by a selection of automatic and manual fire suppression systems. The areas are curbed and surrounded by dikes that can hold the tank contents where spills could occur.  These areas can be pumped into containment tanks. \n\n\n\nAllylamine is "

The areas are curbed and surrounded by dikes that can hold the tank contents where spills could occur.  These areas can be pumped into containment tanks. \n\n\n\nGeneral Release Prevention Plant Safety Activities:\n\n\n\nThe site has a plant manager who oversees all plant activities.  The staff includes a production manager, maintenance manager, training coordinator, technical support, and a part-time nurse who oversees the plant medical program.  All plant employees must attend at least one safety meeting per month.  Safety meetings include training on regulatory requirements and plant specific issues.  The company also uses a Computer Based Training (CBT) program to help facilitate regulatory training.  Testing is conducted for all safety training to insure the information is understood.\n\n\n\nCompliance is the first step to insure process safety but we also do things that go beyond compliance to insure safety.  The Portsmouth Plant manages all plant processes per our Process Safety Management program.  Here are some of the key concepts in our process safety program:\n\n\n\nPeople - Our Most Valuable Safety Resource\n\n\n\n1. All plant operators are trained and certified in the jobs they do.\n\n2. All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n\n3. A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical processing, safety, and regulatory issues.\n\n\n\nEquipment - Maintained in Safe Condition\n\n\n\n1. All plant process equipment is subjected to mechanical integrity inspections to look for corrosion or wear.\n\n2. Safety devices such as pressure relief valves and shutdown systems are inspected and tested on a regular basis.\n\n3. The use of a thermo-gr"

      "SummaryText": "aphic camera allows us to check for temperature deviations in equipment, check for electrical faults, and verify levels.\n\n4. Glass level gauges have been replaced with metal, magnetically-coupled gauges or differential pressure gauges to eliminate the issue of glass breakage. \n\n5. Quarter-turn valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight handle valve open.\n\n\n\nSafety Systems - Layers of Protection\n\n\n\n1. All storage tanks and process vessels are protected against over-pressure by safety relief valves, much like the safety relief valve on your home water heater.\n\n2. Process safety systems are programmed in our process control computers. If a designated level, pressure, temperature, or other parameter goes out of range, the process will shut down automatically.\n\n3. Video cameras monitor key pieces of process equipment and the plant perimeter.\n\n4. All plant modifications and procedure changes undergo a management of change process that involves operations, maintenance, engineering, and management review.\n\n\n\nPlant 5-Year Accident History: \n\n\n\nRMP regulations require us to tell the public about accidents involving the listed chemicals. There were no RMP reportable accidents in: 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 year-to-date. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nPlant operators are members of the emergency response team.  They are trained in the specifics of incident command, emergency response, and medical response.  The plant conducts weekly tests of the plant alarm system and conducts emergency response drills with the local fire department.\n\n\n\nThe US Amines Portsmouth Plant participates in local community activities and works with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to promote safety in our operations.  This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\n\n\n\nHere are some more details:\n\n\n\n1.

The plant alarm system is tested weekly to ensure that employees know how to use it.\n\n5. Personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.\n\n\n\nPlan for Continual Improvement - What We do to Keep Our Plant Safe Now and in the Future:\n\n\n\nWe believe our Process Safety management Program promotes continual improvement in safety and helps guide our company to this safety commitment. The US Amines Portsmouth plant complies with RMP and OSHA Process Safety Regulations through our consolidated Process Safety Management Program.  The Portsmouth plant manages all plant processes per our Process Safety Management program.  We audit ourselves against these polices to help drive continual improvement.
