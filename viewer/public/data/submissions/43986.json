The facility is located at 401 North Grove, Richardson, Texas 75081.  The SIC code for the operation is 4222; the NAICS code is 49312.  The facility has approximately 15 full time employees.  The facility typically operates 12 hours per day, six days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 as their accidental release prevention program.  The system is continuously monitored by computer based controls that alert technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility?s PSM program.  The system is visually inspected periodically for proper operation daily.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.  Safe operation of the system will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures and providing appropriate training to employees.\n\nThis facility has developed and implemented a written Emergency Action Plan as defined in \n29 CFR 1910.38 as their emergency response program.  This facility will utilize outside agencies and/or organizations to perform emergency response measures in the event of a fire, explosion or hazardous material release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThis facility operates as a cold storage warehouse with approximately 60,000 square feet of refrigerated space.  The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to keep products at storage temperature and preserve food safety standards.  The major components of the ammonia "

The operating capacity of the system exceeds this threshold.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical ? Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility complies with the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68.  The facility?s PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work, practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/RMP management of change provisions stated in the facility?s plan.\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant fail safe devices, sensors, and overides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can?t be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with ammonia detectors that alarm and start local exhaust ventilation system when the presence of ammonia is sensed above set point levels in the engine room.  The system can be manually shutdown using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere is no reportable accident history since this is an initial startup.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has made arrangements wit"
