The RMP update was performed in accordance with the requirements stipulated in Final Rule of Risk Management Program Requirements Under Clean Air Act Section 112?(7); Amendments to the submission Schedule and Data Requirements; 69 FR 18819, April 9, 2004.  The submission of this update is done for the sole purpose of addressing administrative changes at the facility that have occurred since the 5-year RMP update submission.\n\nSince the last RMP submission on June 21, 2004, Valero Wilmington Refinery upgraded its HF Alkylation unit with the ReVAP (Reduce Volatile Alkylation Process) technology, an alkylation system that uses modified hydrogen fluoride, and installed a new process Unit 67, Alkylation Feed Dryer Unit.  The Alkylation Feed Dryer removes water from the olefin feed to the Unit 68 HF Alkylation Unit.  \n\nThe upgrade and new installation made in the facility have triggered a revised PHA and hazard review, and subsequently require a revised offsite consequence analysis.  Therefore, in accordance with the requirements stipulated in 40 CFR Part 68, Section 190(b)(5 and 6) [(?68.190(b)(5) and (?68.190(b)(6)), the facility is required to update its RMP within six months of the change.\n\nThis RMP was prepared according to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA RMP Rule, \"Accidental Prevention Requirements, Risk Management Programs under the Clear Air Act, Section 112? (7),\" June 20, 1996,  [CAA 112? (7)]. The analysis approach followed the guidelines contained in EPA?s General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68) and EPA?s RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, such as natural gas, propane and butane, from raw crude oil.

It must submit a single RMP for the entire refinery; because it handles several listed regulated substances that exceed RMP listed threshold quantities (TQ).\n\nIn complying with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP Program Level 3 requirements, the Refinery developed a Process Safety Risk Management System to address Accident Prevention and Emergency Response.  Refinery managers and supervisors in process engineering, project design engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety have primary responsibility for implementation and maintaining element compliance.  Mr. Michael Butler has the designated authority for integration and continuous audit of all RMP elements.\n \nFor the past 5-years, the Refinery has had no reportable accidents involve a part 68 regulated substances with offsite impacts.  Several minor accidental releases of hydrocarbons and toxic materials did occur.  However, neither injuries nor significant property damage occurred (on-site and off-site) due to the effectiveness of the Company's emergency response team. \nThe refinery handles regulated flammable materials in several processes.  The EPA regulated toxic materials handled are anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen sulfide, which are stored in quantities that exceed TQs.\n  \nThe Refinery maintains a Process Safety and Risk Management System (PSRM), which was developed during the implementation of OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).  It is focused on preventing and minimizing the consequences of releases of toxic, flammable and explosive chemicals.  Manager and Supervisor level responsibility for the PSRM system is divided into specific RMP Prevention Program element assignments.

Employee involvement is detailed in the Refinery?s ?Employee Participation and Information Accessibility Plan?. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery process safety management and accident prevention program through manuals and electronic media.  \nEmployee participation in RMP prevention program elements occurs through involvement, consultation and access to information.  As standard business practice employees participate in; PHA?s, procedure development, audits, routine Area Production Team meetings and the Health & Safety Committee process to monitor, evaluate and improve process safety.  \nFurther enhancing these systems, Valero employees have developed a Behavior Based Safety program which encourages job site observations and feedback to fellow employees regarding their safe work practices.  Finally, in May 2003, Valero Wilmington became an OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR site.  As of this writing Valero Wilmington Refinery fully expects the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR site recertification status to be expected in April 2008.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure safe operation of each process.  They address chemical properties and associated hazards, key process parameter limits and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \nHazardous chemical information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by reports that address corrosion and hazards of inadvertent chemical mixing.

Safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, and composition) is documented and used in process hazard reviews to evaluate the consequences of process deviations. \nThe Refinery maintains numerous technical documents that provide materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment and other information.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that process safety features are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Refinery maintains a comprehensive program to ensure that process hazards are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place.  The hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique is primarily used to perform these evaluations. It is conducted by a team of people with operating and engineering expertise to identify and evaluate process hazards and mitigation measures. \nPHA findings and recommendations are prioritized, recorded and tracked to resolution.  Production teams are responsible for addressing recommendations through procedural, hardware, software, and administrative control improvements.  The final resolution is documented and retained. \nTo ensure that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Refinery periodically updates and revalidates hazard analysis results.

These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and revised consistent with changes made through the ?Management of Change Process? and are annually reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  \nIn addition, Operating Limit and Consequences of Deviation documents are maintained, which specify response to exceeding upper or lower limits of process or equipment parameters.\n\nTraining\nThe Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all process employees. The program is described in the Refinery?s ?Training and Promotion Policy?.  New employees receive comprehensive new hire orientation and topic specific training on all aspects of refinery operations, including employee safety, environmental and safety compliance and basic process hazards overview.\nUpon successful completion of training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After demonstrating the ability to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner (e.g., through test, skills demonstration), an operator is allowed to work independently. All operators periodically receive refresher training, at least every 3 years.\n\nContractors\nRefinery procedures ensure contractors perform work in a safe manner, have appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of workplace hazards, understand what to do in an emergency, follow safety rules, and inform refinery personnel of hazards encountered during their work.
