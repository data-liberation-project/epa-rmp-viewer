The City Leaders believe in being proactive rather than reactive to emergencies of any type or size.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide system in the plant are housed in a fire-resistant concrete structure with a negative air pressure system that pulls air through a scrubber designed to scrub the worst-case scenario of a single tank rupture.  On-site training, planning, inspections and revisions are held frequently. Partnerships with City emergency responders as well as the local emergency planning committee has given us added confidence in our ability to coordinate in the event of an emergency involving chlorine and /or sulfur dioxide. Safety procedures, in case of an accidental release, have been outlined by plant personnel and are reviewed frequently. This document includes all procedures for plant personnel to follow including shutdown, repair, evacuation, contacts and notification of authorities."
