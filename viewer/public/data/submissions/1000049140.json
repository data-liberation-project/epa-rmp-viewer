      "SummaryText": "Penn Township takes pride in observing the required safety precautions in preventing hazards in the workplace and has an emergency response plan in effect in the event of accidental releases of regulated substances. The Penn Township wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) employs the latest technology in process controls and monitoring detection systems. Active and passive mitigation systems are designed to minimize the impacts of any accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Penn Township WWTP, owned and operated by Penn Township, provides sewer service to residential, commercial and industrial users located in Penn Township and in portions of Hanover Borough and Heidelberg and West Manheim Townships, York County. The Penn Township WWTP utilizes two (2) chemicals onsite which are subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention provisions found at 40 CFR Part 68 - Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide. However, only Chlorine exceeds the threshold quantities cited in 40 CFR Part 68. Chlorine is used for disinfection of the treated effluent wastewater prior to its discharge to Oil Creek. \n\n\n\nTypically, there are seven (7) one-ton cylinders of Chlorine present onsite at any given time. These cylinders are located in a block chemical storage room of the garage facility. The chlorine room has an intake vent and an exhaust vent equipped with a fan which vents to the outside atmosphere. The chlorination feed system has manual and automatic shutoffs. A remote alarm system is employed to notify employees of any releases of chlorine gas. This alarm system also ties into a security system which dials the telephone numbers of response personnel. Safety equipment is located nearby in the garage portion of the building. The facility is manned 8 hours per day, five days per week and 3 hours per day on the weekends. Gates to the facility are locked when personnel are not on duty. Therefore, the chlorination building is not accessible to the public. The door to the chlorine room is kept lock"

      "SummaryText": "ed at all times.\n\n\n\nA prevention program policy document was developed for the Penn Township WWTP in accordance with regulations found at 40 CFR A?A?68.48-68.60. The facility is classified as a Program 2 facility. The Penn Township Program 2 Prevention Program summarizes the pertinent safety information, hazard review procedures, operating procedures, training requirements, maintenance procedures, compliance audits and incident investigation policies. \n\n\n\nThe facility has standard operating procedures (SOPs) in effect for operation and maintenance of the chlorination system. These SOPs are readily accessible to the chlorine building. Safety precautions include, checking the chlorine detector before entering the chlorine cylinder storage room, use of a face mask or other appropriate personal protective equipment, and testing for leaks with ammonia solution. Training offered to plant employees includes confined space entry procedures, traffic control, and operator health and safety. Documentation of the training events for each employee is maintained in the employee personnel files.\n\n\n\nThe Penn Township WWTP has an Off-Site Emergency Response Plan which has been coordinated through the York County LEPC. The Plan provides notification procedures, emergency response procedures, reporting requirements, and coordination efforts of all involved parties. The plan is reviewed and revised periodically to ensure contact names and telephone numbers are correct. This Off-Site Emergency Response Plan was last revised on January 19, 2010."
