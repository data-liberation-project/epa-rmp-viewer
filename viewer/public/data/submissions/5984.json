This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (Tessenderlo Kerley) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n\tSUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tessenderlo Kerley Facility is located in south central Benton County southwest of Finley, Washington.  The plant occupies approximately five acres at the junction of Chemical Drive and the Northern Railroad tracks on the west bank of the Columbia River.\n\nThe Facility produces and distributes agricultural and industrial chemicals (specifically mining and pulp and paper) for the northwest market.  Production at the Facility consists of the manufacture of fertilizers, pesticides, chemicals used for metal extraction in the mining industry, and chemicals used in the kraft paper industry.  \n\nProducts at the Facility include the manufacture or storage of several agricultural products: two ammonium polysulfide (APS) products, ammonium thiosulfate (ATS), and potassium thiosulfate.  In addition to these agricultural products, the Facility produces the pesticides Vapam and Enzone, as well as the metal extractant, Kermet.  Batch production of flowable sulfur and emulsified aqueous sulfur solution (used in the kraft paper industry) is also conducted at the facility.\n\nThese chemicals utilize several regulated and non-regulated substances as raw materials. The large number of products and their raw materials require loading/unloading operations at the Facil"

Based on process knowledge, Tessenderlo Kerley identified two listed flammable substances and two regulated toxic substances kept on site.\n\nThe regulated flammable substances stored on site at the Facility are dimethylamine and monomethylamine (methylamine).  The regulated toxic substances stored onsite are anhydrous ammonia and carbon disulfide.  The chemicals, largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantity are presented in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nLargest Quantity of Regulated Substances\n\nRegulated Substances                   Largest Quantity On Site (lbs)              Threshold Quantity (lbs)\nDimethylamine                                            130,980                                                 10,000\nMethylamine                                               138,800                                                 10,000\nAmmonia (anhydrous)                               348,600                                                 10,000\nCarbon Disulfide                                        327,172                                                 20,000\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nListed substances, which are stored above threshold quantities at the Finley Facility, are dimethylamine, methylamine, anhydrous ammonia, and carbon disulfide.

Therefore, the process at the Finley Facility subject to the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program is classified as a Program 3 process under the program.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case releases of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psi), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion.

Passive mitigation, such as diked areas, may be taken into consideration.  Additionally, administrative controls that reduce actual storage capacity can be considered.\n\nThe distances to the respective endpoints for the worst-case release of the above threshold quantity toxic substances using the EPA equations are presented in Table 3.

Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fence line.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage. \n\nThe following other conditions may be considered for alternative release scenarios:\n\n7 Release rate dependent upon scenario;\n7 Consideration of active and passive mitigation systems; \n7 Actual release height; and\n7 Use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for dimethylamine as follows.  The two-inch line from the truck unloading station to the dimethylamine tank is sheered.  There is a 5 minute response time before the leak is isolated and the release stopped.

Each tank is supplied with an automatic excess flow shutoff valve.  The instant (one-second release duration) the line is sheered all the valves activate, preventing the entire tank contents from releasing. The alternative release scenario assumes that the total mass released will be equal to the amount that could theoretically be released from the tanks and piping for the one second release duration. A release rate of 319 pounds per minute (lbs/min.) was first developed.  This release rate represents an unmitigated release (no excess flow valves). An alternate release rate of 5.32 lbs/min. was developed which accounts for the mitigation of the excess flow valves and is presented in Table 5. \n\nCarbon disulfide\n\nThe more likely scenario for carbon disulfide assumes that a >-inch li"

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Hazardous Materials Team (HazMat Teams), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Finley Facility actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive technique such as what if/checklist and failure mode and effect or the deductive fault tree technique.  \n\nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.
