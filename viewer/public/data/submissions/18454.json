Accidental release prevention and  EmergencyREsponse Policies:\n\nThe  owners, management and employees of Central Grain Corporation (Site #3) are dedicated to the prevention of any accidental release of ammonia form aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur at the facility, employees and management have been trained and are prepared to work with the Perquimans County Fire Department,  Central Communications of Perquimans County and any surrounding authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the enviroment.\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nThe primary activity of the Site #3 facility of Central Grain Corporation is the blending and storage of fertilizer for sales to agricultural users (farmers).\n\nAqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia is received by tanker truck, stored, and used from the storage tanks in the production of mixed-grade liquid fertilizer for plant nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quanity of aqua ammonia stored at the facility would be 76,400 in 2 tanks, one 13,000 gallon tank and one 22,000 gallon tank, each of which are located in a 3700 sq. foot dike.  This would be 76,400 pounds of ammonia at the maximum of 30% ammonia content.\n\n3.   The worst-case release scenario and alternate release scenario:\n\na)   The worse-case scenario would be the release of the entire contents of  Aqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia from the 22,000 gallon storage tank in the diked area released as a liquid over a 366 minute period.  The maximum amount released would be 164,780 pounds of aqua ammonia whcih would contain  49,500 poundsa of ammonia at 30% maximum ammonia content.  The distance to an endpoinnt of 200 ppm of ammonia, as determined by The  Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degradis- and the passive mitigation of the 3700 sq. foot dike, is 0.54 miles.  The release would affedt 155 residents.  The possibility of this worse case release occuring is extremely unlikely"

The calculated quanity of Aqua Ammonia released would be 1500 pounds which is 450 pounds of ammonia, based on the  maximum of 30% content.  The distance to the end point of 200 ppm of ammonia as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model -Degradis-  is 0.07 miles.  This is 370 feet and would affect  3 residents.The possibility of this alternate release scenario occuring is unlikely as Central Grain Corporation's Site #3 personnel periodically inspect, repair and replace equipment according to industry standard procedures.\n\n4.   The General   Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Central Grain Corp. Site #3 facility has implemented the provisions of Aqua Ammonia supplier's recommendations for safe handling of Aqua Ammonia and appropriate OSHA regulations.  Additionally, periodic training in handling, storage, and use of Aqua Ammonia is conducted with personnel at this location.\n\n5.   The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release of Aqua Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or has resulted in any off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThis Facility has:\n\na.   A written Emergeny Response Plan which is incorporated in the written Community Emergency Response Plan of Perquimans County.\n\nb.   Provided State and Local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCPA).\nThis facilities Emergency Response Program has been discussed with and reviewed by the Perquimans Fire Department.\n\nb."
