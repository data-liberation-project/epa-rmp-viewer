With a strong Process Safety Management program in place, Grace combines both passive and active mitigation systems to prevent offsite consequences in the event of a spill of any hazardous material.  In addition, our highly trained Emergency Response team is always available to respond to any incident, and bring it quickly under control.  Emergency responders are trained annually, and a trained Incident Commander is on site at all times to coordinate emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History - There have been no offsite accidents at this location that had any adverse effects to neighboring industry or the community.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - Grace is committed to an ever improving safety program to maintain its rating in the top 5% in the chemical industry.  We conduct Process Hazards Analyses (PHA) of all chemical operations including lab safety audits for all bench scale processes for new projects.  We conduct Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to improve the quality of PHA studies to ensure thoroughness and effectiveness.  We also conduct reactive hazard evaluations on all processes, with the goal of identifying reactive hazards which might occur during normal or upset conditions.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Grace employs the latest technology in its process controls, monitoring, and mitigation systems to ensure that accidental releases are prevented or the risks associated with them are minimized.

      "SummaryText": "Grace Baton Rouge\r\n\r\n211377 LDEQ Facility ID Number\r\n\r\nThe Grace Baton Rouge facility produces pilot and commerical quantities of silica supported catalysts, single site Metallocene catalysts, and various catalyst activators, all of which utilize flammable solvents.  \r\n\r\nCurrently Grace Baton Rouge has one RMP covered flammable chemical (Diethyl Ether) handled above RMP threshold quantity and no toxic materials above RMP threshold quantities.  The Grace Baton Rouge RMP Process is considered to be a single process since only one RMP covered chemical is utilized but can be interconnected to multiple vessels via pipeline delivery.  The process involves unloading wet Diethyl Ether from a tank trailer at ~40,000 lbs per/trailer into a nominal 6,000 gal wet storage vessel and then periodically pressuring wet Diethyl Ether through a mole sieve drying column into a nominal 3,000 gal dry storage vessel.  The dry Diethyl Ether in then circulated through a loop through the MDU/South processing unit, where a manifold configuration allows dry Diethyl Ether to be transferred to one of five separate reactor vessels for use as a process solvent in similar themed catalyst production processes.  The circulation loop has one take off point that supplies Diethyl Ether to the east SPU scale area, where 250 and 430 gallon portable tanks are periodically filled for on-site process usage that requires absolute potential maximum controlled volume solvent charges at either the MDU/South process unit (covered under PSM/RMP) or the Pilot Plant Building , which not currently covered by PSM or RMP regulation.  The maximum on-site inventory of RMP covered Diethyl Ether is 56,290 lbs aggregately between the wet and dry storage vessels.  The maximum release RMP scenario assumes instantaneous release of the total aggregate inventory while the alternative RMP release scenarion is assumed to be a 1-1/2 flexible hose failure during tank trailer offload.
