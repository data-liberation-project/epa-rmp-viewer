      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\nAmericas Propane operates a LPG terminal located in Sinking Spring, PA that is used to receive, store, and distribute propane at ambient temperature conditions. The facility is situated in a light industrial area with a fuel storage terminal located adjacent to the property. \r\n\r\nThe Sinking Spring terminal has twenty-one (21) horizontal tanks, each with a nominal water capacity of 60,000 gallons. There are twelve (12) tanks in the lower field, normally segregated in banks of four. There are nine (9) tanks in the upper field normally segregated in banks of three. The normal maximum operating liquid level is 85% for each tank. \r\nThere are two truck transport loading spots at the lower end of the site available for loading and on very rare occasions, truck unloading. Propane transfers occur via dedicated loading lines and transfer pumps into transport trailers. Loading is normally automated utilizing totalizing meters located at the racks.  Ethyl mercaptan tank is stored at the terminal and is injected at the truck loading racks.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy \r\nThe same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our operations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. The Terminal has operations personnel appointed as Emergency Plan Manager and Emergency Plan Coordinator. They are able to provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. The ECC has the abil"

      "SummaryText": "ity to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\nWorst Case Scenario \r\nThe worst case scenario that was considered was catastrophic release of propane from a 60, 000 Gallons Tank. Using EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst case distance to 1 psi over pressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.5 miles. Ethyl Mercaptan tank release from 1850 Gallons tank was also considered but is not expected to be as severe as catastrophic release of propane from 60,000 Gallons Tank.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nFor alternative release scenario, release from rupture of 2 pipe at the facility was considered. Using equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis) and Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities (40 CFR 68), the calculated distance to 1 psi over pressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.2 miles.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The objective of the Plan is to facilitate prompt evacuation in case of fire or release of highly hazardous chemical products and to ensure safety of the employees in case of other emergencies like natural disasters. The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations. \r\nThe plans are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain up-to-date, reflecting current activities on site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt evacuation.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe facility has no plans at the present time to make any changes."
