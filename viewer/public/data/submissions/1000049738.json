Trend Gathering and Treating, LLC demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable goals to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Teague Plant, located near Teague, TX, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas.  Regulated flammables such as propane and butane are present but no regulated toxic substances are present at Teague.  Produced gas and liquids enter the plant at an approximate rate of 330MMCFD. The gas will flow through an MDEA (Methyl Diethanolamine) amine unit that will remove the CO2 and H2S. Rich amine will be flashed and the flash gas will be sent to the plants onsite fuel manifold and will be used as fuel for various fired processes in the plant. The rich amine liquid will flow to the amine regeneration unit (reboiler) where the CO2 and H2S will be driven off with heat. The lean amine will return to the amine unit and the overhead H2S and CO2 gas stream from the reboiler will go to the caustic contact tower where a caustic solution (typically sodium hydroxide) will absorb the H2S and flow to the sites closed loop H2S biological treatment unit (Paques Plant). The H2S in the caustic stream will be aerobically reduced with specialized bacteria and the lean caustic will return to the caustic contact tower. The CO2 will be vented. \n\n\n\nTrace amounts of H2S will be emitted from the Paques plant and spent biomass and"

There is no elemental sulfur recovery. \n\n\n\nThe sweetened overhead gas from the amine unit will go the EG (Ethylene Glycol) dehydration, refrigeration and stabilization units. Flash gas from the dehydration unit will be sent to the plant onsite fuel manifold and will be used as fuel for various fired processes in the plant.  Overhead gas from the condenser will be flared. \n\n\n\nNGL's will be extracted, stabilized and sent to atmospheric tanks for truck or pipeline sales. Remaining natural gas will be compressed and sent to pipeline sales. \n\n\n\nNumerous incidental small tanks are located onsite for waste oil, glycol, amine, and other material storage.\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the Whelan Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 10,500 gallons (44,100 lbs.).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.30 miles.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account evaluating this WCS.\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is a BLEVE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is also 0.30 miles.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.   \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Plant maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Teague Plant uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process.

Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe hazard analysis is conducted by a company engineer with maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise of this type of facility. He analyzes and evaluates hazards of the processes, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when he believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe hazardous analysis findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking by the engineer.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the engineer's hazard analysis findings are tracked until they're completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.  Hazard analysis findings will be reviewed anytime equipment or operating procedures are changed.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.  Once the engineer's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Teague Plant maintains written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and pr"

New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through oral test, skills determination) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  The refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Teague Plant has well-established practices for preventative maintenance of pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) performing tests, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (4) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Certified contractors will be used for vessel inspection and pressure relief valve testing.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, and (4) emergency response plans to help ensure that work is performed in a safe manner"
