Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nSherwood Food Distributors requires that each facility develop and maintain accident prevention programs, applicable safety training, crisis management, continuity of operations, and emergency response plans appropriate to the installation. Each installation is also responsible for the regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site. Sherwood Food Distributors Corporate Safety and Risk Office, and the Atlanta Division management provide assistance in training for Atlanta Division employees, as well as procurement of the safety and training requirements.\n\n\n\n2. The Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThe Atlanta Division Distribution Center is located at 5400 Fulton Industrial Boulevard SW in the southwest corner of the city of Atlanta, in Fulton County, Georgia. The facility consists of areas for dry, cooler, and freezer storage of perishable and non-perishable items for distribution to customers.\n\n\n\nThe Atlanta Distribution Center has an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system that exceeds the 10,000 lb. EPA Risk Management Planning threshold quantity. The ammonia refrigeration system equipment is located in the compressor room in the southeast area of the building, with the exception of the high pressure receiver (HPR)and the evaporative condensers. The High Pressure Receiver is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system and is capable of holding approximately 6,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia liquid when filled to 80%. The HPR is located outside of the Distribution Center next to the southeast property boundary. \n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThis facility exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the ammonia refrigeration system and is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29CFR 1910.119.  For Risk Management Planning compliance purposes, th"

The Atlanta Distribution Center will use the PSM program to assist with the compliance requirements of the EPA's Program 3 Accidental Release Prevention Program. \n\n\n\nThe Atlanta Distribution Center has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. The PSM Program was revised in 1998, 2008 and 2014.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance program which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced when scheduled. This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment. In developing the PSM Program, the Atlanta Distribution Center has developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration processes. These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices. These procedures will be used to train all operators and contractors who work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training courses. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained. Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Procedures, were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely. Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found. These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed. To ensure that the Atlanta Distributio"

The staff also performed Process Hazard Analyses of this process. Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies. The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and the involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThe Atlanta Distribution Center has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe Atlanta Distribution Center has Emergency Action and Emergency Response Programs in place. The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and 29 CFR 1910.120(q). The Integrated Contingency Plan has been coordinated with the Fulton County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the State Emergency Response Commission. Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying the Georgia State Warning Point at (800) 241-4113 or (404) 656-6905.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nThe Atlanta Distribution center will continue to provide annual emergency notification and evacuation training for site personnel.  In addition, we will continue to host annual planning and training site visits for our first responders in the future. "
