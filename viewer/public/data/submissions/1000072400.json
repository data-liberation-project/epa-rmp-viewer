FIRST STREET - THE DALLES, OREGON 97058\r\n\r\nOCG's Riverside Plant is committed to be a responsible member of the community in which it operates by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Policy dictates that OREGON CHERRY GROWERS, LLC personnel continuously identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the policy and compliance manuals, and the OCG mission statement, which are both made available to all employees. The Accidental Release Prevention Program policy states:\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Oregon Cherry Growers' Riverside Plant to:\r\n\r\nComply with all applicable safety, health, and environment laws and regulations; Ensure that all unsafe conditions are properly identified and reported, and promptly corrected; Provide training to all personnel so that they can consistently and safely perform their duties; and maintain a safe workplace through prevention, detection, and mitigation.\"\r\n\r\nOregon Cherry Growers, LLC Riverside Plant management stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs, and in written materials available at the plant. Safety and environmental programs include monthly safety meetings with all employees and a joint worker/company safety committee. There are regularly scheduled internal safety and environmental audits conducted by OCG personnel and periodic safety and environmental audits by third-party auditors.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Oregon Cherry Growers, LLC has many critical and technical processing systems in place as part of our operations.

Other processing at this facility includes ingredient cherry processing, processing fruits for drying, fruit drying, and finished product packing.  Our mission is to produce quality fruit products in safe processing operations and protect our employees, our growers, our customers, the public, and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe covered PSM-RMP process for this facility:\r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide:  Sulfur Dioxide gas is transferred from either 90-ton rail cars or 5-ton cylinders.  Sulfur Dioxide gas is bubbled into salt water to prepare brine that preserve, firm, and bleach the cherries.  This process is essential to preserve cherry quality.  To assure that Sulfur Dioxide is handled safely, only trained, qualified operators are authorized to make cherry brine.  Oregon Cherry Growers has a long standing safety program which includes annual SO2 training for all brine making crews, Process Safety Management, meetings when a process change occurs, and continuing follow up to assure safe practices are followed and improved if possible.  Process team members assist in the update of our procedures and safety information.\r\n\r\nProcess improvements completed include perimeter monitoring systems and electronic shut offs. Planned improvements include additional coordinated training with local emergency response agencies and applying the principles of continuous improvement to all chemical handling processes.  All improvements are documented and reviewed with the process team prior to implementation."
