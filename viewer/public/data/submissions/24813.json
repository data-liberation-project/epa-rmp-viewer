The last lost-time injury occurred on August 14, 2000.\n\nThe facility is ISO 9002 certified.\n\n\n2.0\tPROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\n\n\nGAC Chemical Corporation manufactures primarily inorganic chemicals at its Searsport, Maine, facility.  With regards to 40 CFR Part 68, anhydrous ammonia, agueous ammonia (> 20% concentration), and chlorine are handled and stored at quantities exceeding the threshold quantities.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia was first used at the site in 1956 with the startup of an anhydrous ammonia synthesis plant.  The facility included two 2000 ton refrigerated storage spheres.  This production unit operated until 1966 when it was shutdown due to business conditions.  The production facility was sold and dismantled in 1967.  One of the storage spheres was used for storage of refrigerated anhydrous ammonia until 1988 when its use for storage was discontinued.  The second sphere was maintained in serviceable condition for backup purposes only.  The spheres were dismantled and sold for scrap in 1994.\n\nAfter the use of the spheres for storage was discontinued, anhydrous ammonia was stored in smaller horizontal pressure vessels.  The larger vessel (16,700 gallon working capacity) is located in the ammonia receiving area while the smaller vessel (3,900 gallon working capacity) is located in the ammonium sulfate production area.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the faci"

It is unloaded in a closed system using a compressor to remove vapors from the larger storage vessel and pressurizing the rail car with this vapor.  The resultant differential pressure pushes the liquefied anhydrous ammonia to the storage vessel.  The maximum pressure in the anhydrous ammonia system during unloading and storage is 120 psig.  The operational pressure rating for the storage vessel is 250 psig.\n\nTransfers of anhydrous ammonia from the larger storage vessel to either aqueous ammonia production or to the smaller vessel is via small transfer pumps.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia unit started production in May 1995.  Aqueous ammonia is produced by injecting a controlled volume of anhydrous ammonia in a re-circulating flow of unfinished aqueous ammonia.  The batch production process is continued until the desired concentration of ammonia in the solution is reached.  The maximum batch size (limited by the working capacity of the production tank) is approximately 9,000 gallons.  Finished aqueous ammonia is stored in a 28,400 gallon working capacity tank.  Both of the aqueous ammonia vessels are located in a common containment structure.\n\nAmmonium sulfate has been produced in Searsport since 1949.  A new modern production unit went into service in October 1992.  The older unit was shutdown in August of that year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is supplied to the ammonium sulfate process as a vapor.  The smaller anhydrous ammonia tank is coupled with a small vaporizer.  The combined units are maintained at a constant level to permit steady-state vaporization of the ammonia.  The maximum pressure in this anhydrous ammonia system during ammonium sulfate production is 120 psig.  The operational pressure ratings for both the smaller storage vessel and the vaporizer are 250 psig each.\n\nNo regulated waste ammonia, anhyd"

The conversion of anhydrous ammonia in both processes is 100 percent.\n\nChlorine is scheduled to be used for the first time at the Searsport facility on or about January 2, 2002, with the startup of a Powell Continuous Bleach Plant.  The facility includes no permanent storage for chlorine.  Chlorine will be supplied to the process directly from rail cars.  The facility has capacity for many rail cars, but the operating plan calls for having no more than two 90 ton rail cars of chlorine at the plant at any one time.  Only one car will be in service at any time.\n\nChlorine is transferred to the production unit from the rail car in liquid form.  There are no intermediate storage vessels or vaporizer systems for chlorine.  The chlorine is 100 percent consumed in the production of sodium hypochlorite bleach solution.  Chlorine is not used in any other processes nor is it repackaged and shipped from the facility.\n\nThe chlorine is transferred to the process via a permanent pipeline with flexible hoses for attachment to the rail car valves.  The transfer process is accomplished using dry compressed air so that corrosion of the system is eliminated.  The pipeline is constructed of welded steel with a minimum of flanged or threaded joints.  All welds have been x-ray tested to assure the quality of the welded joints.  The maximum pressure in the chlorine system during unloading is 150 psig.  The pressure rating for the rail car is 375 psig.  The piping system has a pressure relief system utilizing rupture disks, rated at 300 psig, which relieve into expansion tanks.  Every section of pipe that can be isolated between two valves is fitted with a rupture disk/expansion tank system.  The tanks have both local pressure indication, as well as pressure switches which will be tied into the control and monitoring system.\n\nThe unloading system incorporates the Powell Unloading Valve Closure System.

All devices are connected to a monitoring and control system that will issue warnings and/or alarms as appropriate.  For any failure or alarm condition, the Powell Unloading Valve Closure System will activate closing the rail car valves.  The unloading system has been designed to allow for the depressurization and complete purging of the chlorine from the chlorine pipeline via the Powell Provent Scrubber System.\n\nIn the production of bleach, a controlled flow of chlorine is injected into a re-circulating flow of dilute caustic soda/bleach solution.  The chlorine is 100 percent consumed in the reaction to form the sodium hypochlorite bleach solution.  The bleach plant is scheduled to start production on or about January 2, 2002.\n\nNo regulated waste chlorine or chlorine byproduct is generated by any handling or processing at the Searsport facility.\n\n\n3.0\tRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFour regulated processes exist at the facility.  They are as follows:\n\nProcess 1:  Anhydrous ammonia receiving and storage\nProcess 2:  Aqueous ammonia production and storage\nProcess 3:  Ammonium sulfate production\nProcess 4:  Chlorine receiving and handling\n\nAll release scenarios were analyzed using RMP*Comp for the impact radius calculations and Landview III for estimating the affected population within the impacted areas."

These devices limit the amount of chlorine that could be released due to a condition of continuous, unrestricted flow. \n\nProcess 4/Alternate 7:  The complete failure of the 1.5 inch transfer hose.  The rail car has an excess flow valve installed at the unloading connection.  For the reasons stated above, this scenario is least likely of the alternate cases for Process 4.  The calculated impact radius is 3.4 miles.  The estimated population that may be affected is 3,003. \n\nProcess 4/Alternate 8:  The release of chlorine via a faulty valve packing or flange.  A leak path size equivalent to a 0.25 inch diameter opening was assumed.  The release calculation assumes full, unrestricted flow at a pressure of 130 psig (the normal maximum operating pressure).  The calculated impact radius is 0.7 miles.  The estimated population that may be affected is 175.\n\nProcess 4, Note 1:  In all cases, any leaking chlorine would be detected by the chlorine sensors that would cause the Powell Unloading Valve Closure System to activate.  After closure of the rail car valves, the chlorine transfer line would be immediately purged to the Provent Scrubber.\n\nProcess 4, Note 2:  An emergency C kit is available for the temporary repair of a leaking flange or valve.\n\n\n4.0\tPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nAll aspects of ammo"

      "SummaryText": "nia and chlorine handling and use at the facility are covered by the facility's Process Safety Management Plan.  The standard operating procedures (SOPs) are reviewed and updated whenever an operational change is made.  If no operational changes are made, the SOPs are reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\nThe ISO 9002 program at the GAC Chemical Corporation in Searsport, Maine, requires rigid compliance to SOPs, preventive maintenance procedures, and instrument calibrations.  All procedures must be reviewed annually.  The ISO 9002 program is audited internally every year (audit components are distributed throughout the year) and re-certified by a third party annually.\n\nMandatory monthly training sessions are attended by all production and maintenance employees.  The subjects include annual training of SOPs, hazards communications, fire safety, electrical safety, and pollution prevention.\n\nGAC Chemical Corporation supports a fully trained and equipped HAZMAT Team to address incidents that may occur at the facility and in the transportation of product shipped from the facility.  Depending upon the circumstances of an on-site or transportation incident, a contract responder such as Clean Harbors may be called in for assistance. \n\n\n5.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia (vapor or liquid) or aqueous ammonia in the last five years.  Since chlorine has not been used on the site in the past, there is no history of releases for this substance.  \n\n\n6.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan for the facility was first published in April 1991.  It was completely reviewed and updated in February 1999; the plan will be updated again to include the use of chlorine at the facility.  Upon completion of the plan to include the use of chlorine, all the processes and chemicals handled at the facility will be covered.  The plan is coordinated with the Waldo County Emergency Management Agency and the Waldo County L"
