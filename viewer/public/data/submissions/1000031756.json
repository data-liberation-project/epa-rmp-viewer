      "SummaryText": "Introduction / Background\n\n\n\nHolston Army Ammunition Plant (HSAAP), located on two sites in Kingsport, Tennessee, is a federal government owned, contractor operated facility. It was built in 1942 to produce RDX (cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine) and HMX (cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine) based explosives for the Joint Munitions Command (JMC) of the US Army. In 1999 BAE SYSTEMS Ordnance Systems Inc. (OSI) became the operating contractor. While continuing to produce RDX and HMX based explosives, HSAAP has been developing newer insensitive munitions to assist the Department of Defense in meeting its requirement to provide safer products to US military personnel.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nHSAAP has had an excellent safety record over the past 70 years and strives to maintain this outstanding record.  HSAAP maintains an on-site emergency response team but also has long standing agreements and coordination with local emergency planning units including Hawkins County and the City of Kingsport.  \n\n\n\nOSI's Safety & Health Policy is based on the concept of Total Employee Involvement. This concept recognizes that all personnel have a shared responsibility for the prevention of accidents, damage, or loss from any controllable source. In addition, senior management at HSAAP is committed to environmental stewardship, safety, and emergency preparedness. This commitment has been demonstrated through development and implementation of an Environmental Policy Statement and a Safety & Health Policy. Additionally, OSI pursued and obtained ISO 14001 certification for its Environmental Management System in November 2006 and has maintained this certification through surveillance and recertification audits. HSAAP has been identified as a Center of Excellence by third party auditors. OSI pursued and obtained ISO 18001 certification in August 2009 for its Occupational Health and Safety Management System. Recertification was obtained in June 2012.  \n"

      "SummaryText": "\nThe Safety Manager sends out monthly updates on workplace safety statistics and encourages safe practices through an incentive based safety award program. Incidents and near misses are investigated, and information is shared with all personnel to help prevent similar occurrences. \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nManufacturing of explosives requires the use of concentrated nitric acid and anhydrous ammonia; two listed substances under the Risk Management Plan. HSAAP has two nitric acid tank farms and two anhydrous ammonia tank farms. A smaller anhydrous ammonia tank exists at the agile manufacturing facility with the storage quantity below the threshold. However, this chemical is included in the covered process description because it is also treated as a Program Level 3 chemical by OSI. An insensitive explosive material that will be new to production at HSAAP requires the use of oleum, another listed substance under the Risk Management Plan.  The oleum will be stored in one tank at the agile manufacturing facility above the threshold quantity. This is one reason for the current update.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release & Chemical-Specific Prevention Programs\n\n\n\nIn addition to the RMP, HSAAP is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and other related emergency response rules and regulations. Since HSAAP manufactures explosives most processes are Program Level 3 under PSM rules. Safe reliable production of explosives depends on an effectively implemented safety program. Elements of HSAAP's PSM include: process safety information management, process hazard analyses, standard operating procedures, proper training, mechanical integrity checks, Change Management, Pre Start-up reviews, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permitting, and contractor oversight.\n\n\n\nPersonnel are trained annually on emergency response and hazard communication. Other safety-related topics are assigned based on each employee's job"

      "SummaryText": " duties. Standard operating procedures are reviewed annually for completeness with required updates every five years or when a process change occurs that affects the procedure. Process Hazard Analysis studies are conducted for RMP or OSHA-covered new processes or changes to existing processes or on any other process deemed necessary by the Safety Manager. Revalidation of Process Hazard Analysis studies are conducted every five years. Management of Change procedures are followed for changes to equipment or operating procedures.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia,  nitric acid, and oleum areas utilize a variety of technologies to prevent accidental chemical releases including the following:  dikes, deluge systems, detection monitoring, process control alarms, automatic shutoffs, and annual training. Training is very important at HSAAP. This is apparent because third party auditors have recognized HSAAP's training program as a best practice among similar facilities across the U.S. OSI also utilizes a sophisticated facility-wide notification system with voice command capabilities to alert employees and the public in the event of a hazardous vapor release.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nHSAAP had four incidents involving strong nitric acid and three incidents involving anhydrous ammonia during the five-year period. Three of the nitric acid incidents were below the reportable quantity with all but one of these being contained entirely to the on-site industrial wastewater treatment plant. One of these resulted in a minor burn. The fourth nitric acid incident did involve a reportable release with some material reaching the ground and a small amount traveling to the river. The majority was captured by the on-site industrial wastewater treatment plant. This spill also resulted in an employee injury with time away from work. Two of the ammonia incidents were reported as releasess and did travel off-site but were below the toxic endpoint before reaching the fence line. There were no injures as"

Follow-up actions have been conducted to prevent futher incidents and releases.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, special management systems must be employed to control the emergency response scene and coordinate emergency response personnel.  The Incident Command System (ICS) is a set of preplanned assignments and job subdivisions implemented to reduce confusion in handling the emergency. The priorities of the system are: (1) safety of employees and responders, (2) safety of others in and around the area, (3) scene stabilization, and (4) property and environmental conservation. All personnel required to respond to an emergency or remain at an emergency scene are considered emergency response personnel for the duration of the emergency.\n\n\n\nICS includes coordination with local emergency planning units including Hawkins County and the City of Kingsport. To support this relationship an annual emergency training drill is held in conjunction with all other contract employees onsite and local emergency responders. Furthermore, HSAAP has a fully manned and trained onsite fire department with HAZMAT capabilities that responds to all types of emergencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nHSAAP continues to strive to modernize the facility and to constantly improve health, safety, and security through the use of the best available technology and work practices. As previously mentioned, HSAAP maintains a certified Occupational Health and Safety Management System in compliance with ISO 18001."
