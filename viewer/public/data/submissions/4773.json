As part of this commitment, CPI has established procedures to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facilities.  CPI's Wisconsin Rapids Division (Wisconsin Rapids) has developed a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and helps to manage the risks of the covered substances and processes.  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan describing the risk management program at Wisconsin Rapids.  This document is intended to satisfy the risk management plan requirements of the RMP rule.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIn April 1967, CPI adopted a corporate environmental policy that guides the continuous improvement of its environmental performance as it strives to prevent pollution and achieve the objective of operating facilities with minimal environmental impact.  This policy was updated in November 1996.  The corporate environmental policy statement is publicly available on CPI's Internet website.  As part of its risk reduction objective, CPI will strive to minimize environmental, health, and safety risks to its employees and the communities in which it operates by employing safe technologies and operating procedures.  CPI will be constantly prepared for emergencies.  CPI will continually inform its employees and public of its progress in safety and environmental issues.  \n\nCPI is one of 26 Wisconsin paper companies voluntarily participating in the Wisconsin Paper Council's Pollution Prevention Partnership with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  As part of this membership, CPI produces an annual report that illustrates CPI and the Wisconsin paper industry's commi"

CPI's Pollution Prevention Partnership Progress Report is available to the public.  \n\nCPI has also pledged to voluntarily align its corporate Environmental Management System to ISO 14001 international standards and to adhere to the American Forest and Paper Association's Environmental Health and Safety Principles.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCPI is North America's largest producer of coated printing papers and a major manufacturer of supercalendered printing papers for the printing and publishing industries.  In addition, CPI is the leading manufacturer of coated specialty papers used in consumer product packaging and labeling.  CPI also produces elemental chlorine-free kraft pulp for its own use from virgin wood fiber and recycled pulp from printed and post-consumer wastepaper.  Other products manufactured by CPI include paperboard and paperboard products.\n\nCPI is headquartered in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin.  It owns and operates paper and pulp manufacturing facilities in Biron, Kimberly, Appleton, Niagara, Stevens Point, Whiting, and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, as well as in Duluth, Minnesota.  It also operates wastewater treatment plants in Stevens Point, Niagara, Kimberly, and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin to treat wastewater generated by the pulp and paper manufacturing plants.  Wastewater treatment is also done at the facilities in Duluth, Minnesota.\n\nWisconsin Rapids is a paper mill owned and operated by CPI in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin.  At this facility, heavier-weight groundwood-free coated printing paper, paperboard, and paperboard products are produced.  The coated paper product is used for brochures, advertising inserts, corporate annual reports and brochures, catalogs, magazines, and other printed materials.  The paperboard is manufactured from recycled wastepaper.\n \nChlorine is the only chemical regulated by the RMP "

The chlorine is stored in five aboveground cylinder tanks, each with a design capacity of one ton.  The total quantity of chlorine stored at this facility is 10,000 lb.  The chlorine tanks are located inside a building.  Chlorine is a toxic gas liquefied by pressure in the storage tank and is used to treat process water.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involving chlorine is defined as the rupture of one of the five chlorine storage tanks, instantaneously releasing its entire contents into the building.  The building enclosure contains the entire spill and reduces the release rate into the atmosphere.  The release rate from the building is based on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document.  This scenario was modeled using the Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) model to predict the toxic endpoint.  The worst-case release of chlorine is predicted to have offsite impacts on public receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nSince the worst-case release scenario predicted offsite impacts, an alternative release scenario involving chlorine is reported.  The alternative release scenario is defined as an indoor release of chlorine due to the failure of the tubing connecting the chlorine tank to the water chlorination process.  The total quantity of chlorine released into the building is 88.6 lb.  The building enclosure contains the entire spill and reduces the release rate into the atmosphere.  The release rate from the building is based on the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document.  This scenario was modeled using the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) model to predict the toxic endpoint.  The alternative release of chlorine is predicted to have no offsite impact on public or environmental rec"

The Incident Command System is designed to provide both public and private sector emergency response personnel with a logical building block system for managing hazardous material emergencies.\n\nThe system is designed to begin at the point where emergency response personnel recognize that they are in fact, dealing with a hazardous material emergency, even when the exact hazardous material has not be identified.\n\nThe local fire department is also trained to the Incident Command System and will join with the Wisconsin Rapids team members and co-command on an incident.\n\nThe Incident Command System identifies a chain of command in response situations.
