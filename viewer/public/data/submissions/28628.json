The process will include:\n\n?On-site aqueous ClO2 generation system\n?ClO2 delivery system consisting of gas emitters located within the building\n?Exhaust system with scrubber and vapor phase granular carbon adsorber to maintain a negative pressure within the building (2 systems)\n?Scrubbing liquid delivery systems. \n\nThe fumigation system is expected to go into operation Fall 2003 and will be operated only for the purpose mentioned above. After fumigation, ClO2 will be removed from the building and the systems will be dismantled.\n\nA Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is prepared because the total quantity of ClO2 in the system is expected to exceed the threshold quantity.  The RMPlan is specifically for the ClO2 fumigation process because no other process in the facility handles or stores any listed chemical above the threshold quantity.\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) was developed based on the gaseous release of all ClO2 within the building during fumigation.  The emission of ClO2 was calculated based on a building average concentration of 1100 ppmv.  The resulting impact distance is 4.2 miles.  The impact distance is defined as the distance to the toxic endpoint for ClO2 mentioned in the RMP (1 ppmv).   The impact of the WCS \nextends outside the facility property line.\n\nThe alternative scenario involving a ClO2 gas release from the exhaust system fan or wet scrubber has been mitigated by a process design change.  The fan will be relocated downstream of the scrubber, which significantly reduces the potential ClO2 leakage from the fan and changes the scrubber operation to vacuum service (air leaks in).  The revised alternative scenario is being submitted based on a recent review of the process hazards analysis (PHA) of the covered process.  The alternative scenario is ClO2 gas evaporation from a liquid spil"
