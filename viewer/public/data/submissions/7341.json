THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF THE STORAGE TANK OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WOULD BE 131,580 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS 1.06 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS .31 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nA. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE INC.\n\nB.
