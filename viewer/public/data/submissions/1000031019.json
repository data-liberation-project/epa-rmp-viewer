It is the intent of the Jefferson Street Truck Rack to incorporate the most recent construction and procedural guidance (NFPA # 58-2011 Edition) into this process. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the KM Fire Department/emergency response personnel as well as the City of Pasadena Emergency Mangement. Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Medical Services (Channel Industries Mutual Aid [CIMA]) and Bayshore Medical Center.\r\n\r\nKinder Morgan Liquids Terminals LLC - Jefferson Street Truck Rack is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and two butane storage vessels.\r\n\r\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the system's two butane storage vessels when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The facility's alternate (potential for off-site impacts) release scenario is a BLEVE accident and associated fireball.\r\n\r\nKinder Morgan Liquids Terminals LLC - Jefferson Street Truck Rack complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer (Sunoco"

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with fire department and the City of Pasadena Emergency Management. The KM Fire Department/emergency response personnel has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\r\n\r\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Kinder Morgan Liquids Terminals LLC looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. Additionally, the KM Fire Department/emergency response personnel is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."
