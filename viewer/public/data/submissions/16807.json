Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Great Lakes Chemical Corporation(GLCC) Memphis Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, the Memphis site utilizes the highly trained Shelby County Emergency Response Team to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are completely coordinated with Memphis-Shelby County LEPC on all incidents that may impact the community. \n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Organic chemical synthesis.  We have 2 RMP substances regulated at our facility.  These substances are furan and ammonia which are involved in several uses.  Furan is used for chemical synthesis and is then converted into other organic compounds or sold as a commercial chemical product.  Ammonia is also used for chemical synthesis and additionally for process water neutralization.\n\nThe maximum tank volume of furan at our facility is 400000 pounds. While ammonia is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 15000 pounds.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nIn order to perform the required off-site consequence analysis the GLCC Memphis  facility used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  While GLCC Memphis has excellent "

      "SummaryText": "programs to respond to a release of furan,  this worst case scenario does not allow any active mitigation to be considered, and further requires the release to occur  under conditions that are not indicative of any conditions which have been encountered. The following paragraphs provide details of both the \"worst case release scenario\"  and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release of the entire 400000 pounds of furan over a short period of time.  The furan liquid is assumed to be immediately released from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 530 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability (i.e. laminar flow)  and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of greater than 25 miles is obtained which corresponds to the  toxic endpoint of 0.0012 mg/L listed 40 cfr Part 68 Appendix A.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is also included for both substances in Program 3 processes. The alternative release scenario allows use of active and passive mitigation. The alternative release scenario evaluates the five year accident history (see section 5 below) to evaluate potential scenarios. Since there have been no incidents as defined by EPA, an artificial scenario was created. The following provides further details of the alternate release scenarios.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for furan involves a release from a pump seal or flange failure in the furan process.  The scenario involves the release of 1500 pounds of furan.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 1500 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by act"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0012 mg/L listed in Appendix A is 0.25 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a gaseous release from the ammonia storage in our Polymeg process.  The scenario involves a release of 100 pounds of ammonia from a pipe or flange failure. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L for ammonia is 0.06 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
