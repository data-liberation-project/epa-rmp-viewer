      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \n\nA.  It is the policy of the Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) Corn Processing Facility, Columbus, Nebraska to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to prevent an explosion/fire or release of chlorine, or sulfur dioxide and in the unlikely event of a release to minimize the potential impact to ADM?s employees, the public, and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining a preventative maintenance program, providing appropriate training to employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary with the Columbus Fire Department.\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThis facility consists of a Corn Wet Milling plant that processes corn into value added products such as corn sweeteners, fuel ethanol, and dry specialty products.\n\nIn this update of the Risk Management Plan, ADM has included programs for its denaturant used in the production of fuel ethanol.  The denaturant (natural gasoline) used at the facilities generally has a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of less than 4 and is exempt from the RMP according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2).  However, due to the potential variability in the makeup of this additive, it is possible that ADM could receive material that has a flammability rating of 4.  Therefore, ADM has included provisions in the Risk Management Plan for managing the denaturant as a precautionary measure.  \n\nThe regulated substances used at this facility are chlorine, sulfur dioxide and n-pentane & 1-pentane.  Chlorine is used as a bacterial inhibitor in process cooling water.  Sulfur dioxide is used as a processing aid.  N-pentane & 1-pentane are components of the natural gasoline used in the denaturant for fuel ethanol production.\n\n\nC.  Off-Site Consequence Analysis\nTo perform the required offsite consequence "

      "SummaryText": "analysis, ADM used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance - revised April 1999, the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants - October 1998.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Toxic Substances: For multiple toxic substances subject to Program 3 requirements, the EPA requires that a worst-case scenario be evaluated for the toxic substance estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint. The worst-case scenario for substances that are normally gases at ambient temperatures but are liquefied by pressure assumes that the single largest container fails catastrophically and the entire contents are released as a gas over a ten-minute period resulting in offsite impacts.  The worst-case scenario for this facility involves a catastrophic release from the rupture of the sulfur dioxide aboveground storage tank.  Safe work practices, preventative maintenance programs and the safety devices included in the design of the system make this scenario extremely unlikely.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Toxic Substances: EPA requires that one alternative scenario, or more realistic scenario, be evaluated for each toxic substance.  EPA also requires that each alternative scenario result in off-site impacts, if such a scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide would be a valve on the transfer line inadvertently opened due to human error.  The HAZMAT team would respond to shut off the valve for this scenario. The alternative release scenario for chlorine would be shearing off of a cylinder valve on the one-ton cylinder. No active or passive mitigation measures were considered for this scenario. \n\nWorst-Case Flammable Substances: For multiple flammable substances subject to Program 3 requirements, the EPA requires that a worst-case scenario be evaluated for the flammable substance estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint.

The worst-case scenario for this facility involves a catastrophic release from the denaturant (natural gasoline) storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch).  Safe handling procedures, work practices and the fire-protection system makes this scenario extremely unlikely.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Flammable Substances: EPA requires one alternative scenario, or more realistic scenario, be evaluated for one flammable substance.  The alternative release scenario for the denaturant (natural gasoline) would be a break in the line supplying liquid denaturant from the storage tank to the process, or a storage tank leak.  This liquid leak would be contained via the concrete dike surrounding the storage tank. \n\nD.  Accidental Release Prevention\nThe key concepts in this facility's prevention programs are the elements of OSHA?s Process Safety Management Program under 29 CFR 1910.119, which all of this facility?s RMP processes are subject to.  These concepts include: employee participation, analysis of hazards, operating procedures and safe work practices, personnel training, maintenance and mechanical integrity programs, and contractor programs.  \n\n\nE.  Five-Year Accident History\nThis facility has not had any accidents involving chlorine, sulfur dioxide or pentane that require reporting under EPA?s Risk Management Rule.\n\n\n\nF.  Emergency Response Program\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with ADM personnel and the City of Columbus Fire Department so that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures will be implemented.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan and onsite HAZMAT team to deal with prevention of and response to accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The facility is al"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs a result of safety reviews, the following safety improvements to this facility's denaturant/ethanol tank farm are planned: upgrade all electrical components to Class I/ Division I standards, upgrade the fire system to include foam, increase the capacity of the tank farm secondary containment, review and improve SOPs to meet the latest ADM Columbus format, and implement regular inspections on all tanks and piping related to the tank farm.\n \nADM will continue to evaluate and implement changes when necessary to improve safety at the Columbus facility."
