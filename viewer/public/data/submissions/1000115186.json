Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at United Farmers Co-op in Norseland are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the St. Peter Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank, twenty-five 1,450-gallon tanks, and fourteen 1,000-gallon tanks at our facility in Norseland (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 80,250 gallons (350,603 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85% including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 262446 pounds at 85 % maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nUnited Farmers Co-op maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating para"

These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nUnited Farmers Co-op has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. \n\nMechanical Integrity\nUnited Farmers Co-op conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at United Farmers Co-op to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nUnited Farmers Co-op routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedu"
