In conjunction with this business, the facility at 539 S. Drew Streets conducts several processes involving 3 regulated materials: aqueous ammonia (in less than threshold quantities), propylene oxide and formaldehyde.  The manufacture of polyols is the only process which utilizes regulated materials in significant quantities.\n\nThe process to manufacture polyols utilizes 2 regulated materials:\n\n7 propylene oxide          maximum quantity in storage:       132000 lb.\n7 Formaldehyde             maximum quantity in storage:         50000 lb.\n\nBoth of these materials are used as reactants in the manufacture of polyols.  \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:     Each of these materials are stored in secondary containment to minimize the release of material in the event of failure, and in the case of propylene oxide, there is 24 hour automatic monitoring for leaks.  In the event of release, the Mesa Fire Department will be notified, either by telephone or automatically, to respond to the release of regulated materials.\n\nWorst case scenario:     The worst case scenario is the failure of a full storage tank (58000 lb.) of formaldehyde into the diked containment area.  Under worst case weather, the substance could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to pose a hazard to the public.\n\nAlternative case scenarios:     The more likely alternative scenario is the release 2570 lb. of formaldehyde due to pipe leakage during transfer, resulting in a endpoint of 0.1 miles from the source.  Another alternative is a leak of propylene oxide from it's pressurized tank into the containment vault.  This would result in an end point of approximately 0.1 miles from the source.\n\nAccidental release prevention program:      The company is in"

The propylene oxide is contained in an underground vault, with 24 hour automatic monitoring which would notify the emergency response personnel in the event of a leak.\n\nFive year accident history:     There have been no accidental releases of regulated materials from these processes in the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency response plan:     SWD Urethane has an emergency response plan, but is a non responding facility.  In the event of an accidental release, the emergency responders will be notified to handle the spill and cleanup.  Periodic meetings with the local authorities have been held."
