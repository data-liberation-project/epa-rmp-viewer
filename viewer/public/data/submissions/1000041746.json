The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The GCC PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of GCC to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  \n\n\n\nA \"Non-responding facility\" policy has been adopted; however the Company also recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (San Luis Obispo County CUPA) and the California Dept of Forestry Fire Department.

Qualified personnel trained beyond 1910.120(q) Awareness Level would support the Public Responders in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nGuadalupe Cooling Company (GCC) is a refrigeration plant located 1.7 miles north of Guadalupe, CA.  Frontier Industries constructed the initial facility in the early 1980's, according to the codes and standards locally adopted at that time.  Expansions and upgrades have been made with the assistance of reputable companies, according to the codes and standards in effect in their particular time-frames.  The overall site occupies approximately 20 acres of land.   Several commercial neighbors are located on the same property.  Farmland (row crops) surround the facility.  The Cabrillo Highway (Highway 1) runs along one facility border.\n\n  \n\nThe facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables, ice-making, and short-term refrigerated storage before the fresh produce is shipped to destination points.\n\n\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia CAS 7664-41-7 (NH3).  Refrigeration equipment consists of Compressors, Pressure Vessels, HydroVac&trade; Vacuum Tubes, Ice-making equipment, Pressure Cooling Equipment, Cold Storage Room Evaporators plus associated valves, instrumentation, piping and controls.  Vacuum Tubes, Pressure Cooling and Ice-making units are used to pre-cool certain agricultural products; the refrigerated storage portion of the facility is used for short-term product storage.  Evaporators in the storage and dock sections of the facility maintain temperature until product is sold and shipped.  The refrigeration system is configured in a closed-loop system including safety cut-outs, isolation valves and overpressure relief valves installed in key areas.  "

Depending on geographical & seasonal harvest demand, portable units may also be rented to other companies in other areas from November - April.  Portable equipment consists of Vacuum Tubes, Pressure Coolers and Ice-making equipment.  The portable refrigeration equipment concept has been in use 50+ years and is common to the industry.  \n\n\n\nGCC is supported by an affiliate company, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  WPS is a state-wide and well-known provider of portable ammonia refrigeration equipment and maintenance services.    \n\n \n\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established in accordance with CCR 8, 5189.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and process, and to prevent accidental releases.  GCC strives to make the PSM Program an integral part of daily Plant operation.  Other safety programs are integrated with the PSM Program, to the extent practicable and appropriate.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n - Security patrol and traffic guards have been instituted\n\n - Entrance to the facility is closely monitored.  An ID Badge system is in place.\n\n - The facility is enclosed with fencing and gates.\n\n - Closed Circuit Cameras (CCTV) monitor the facility 24/7/365\n\n - Traffic patterns and barriers such as K-rails are established for Process collision prevention\n\n - Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandals, etc.  Training is documented. \n\n - Only qualified personnel perform work on the process.  \n\n - Self-closing valves are installed for process oil draining\n\n - GCC has established a Food Safety Program that includes sanitation and h"

Personnel not trained beyond OSHA 1910.120 (q) Awareness Level notify and evacuate.  Only the responding Fire Department(s) would respond to an actual emergency; GCC's 1910.120 (q) personnel trained beyond Awareness Level would be available for support.

The consolidated CA Hazardous Material Business Plan, Hazardous Materials Management Plan & Emergency Action Plan include general emergency procedures and procedures for small spills; including materials other than ammonia.  Expanded ammonia-specific written emergency procedures are detailed in the GCC \"Thirty Minute Plan\".  Each of these Plans is maintained and updated as needed or required.
