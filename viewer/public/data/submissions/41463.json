              "Description": "Anhydrous ammonia is not stored or used on-site on a full time basis.  It is brought onto the site in a standard railcar (~70 ton capacity) when the dealer needs to fill his liquid fertilizer storage tanks with an ammonium polyphosphate product.  The ammonia is reacted with phosphoric acid (also brought on site is railcars) to produce the product.  The production of the liquid fertilizer is carried out in a portable pipe reactor which is brought on-site by an independent contractor/operator.  The portable pipe reactor operator assumes responsibility for the ammonia when he comes on-site and hooks the ammonia car to the portable pipe reactor.  The portable pipe reactor is covered under OSHA's PSM.  The only responsibility for the terminal personnel is the time period when the ammonia railcar is spotted on site prior to the arrival of the portable pipe reactor (possibly 1-5 days).  The prevention program for the terminal is based on maintaining set operating and maintenance procedures.  The operating and maintenance procedures used by the terminal is basically the periodic observation of the railcar to detect leaks or vandalism.  The operators for the terminal will serve only as an observer basis and calling responsible individuals if serious leaks are noted.",

THE FACILITY POLICY\nThe owners, management, and employees of Terral RiverService Terminal (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the facility is  prepared to work with the local police, fire, LEPC and/or any other authorities to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe primary activity at the facility is the warehousing of solids and liquid fertilizers.  Anhydrous ammonia is located on-site for only limited time periods.  The ammonia is brought on-site in railcars and is stored there as is phosphoric acid until an outside contractor (portable pipe reactor) comes on-site and hooks his processing machine to them.  The facility is responsible for the ammonia railcar only during the time period between when the railcar arrives on-site and the outside contractor hooks to it.  After the contractor hooks to the railcar, his OSHA based Process Safety Management plan (PSM) takes over the operation and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system.\nThe maximum quantity stored on-site at any one time would be approximately 300,000 # (2 railcars).\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a railcar (150,000#) over a 10 minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 4.4 miles as calculated using RMP Comp.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likey potential incident is a release from a leaking valve due to mechanical failure or having been left partially open by an unauthorized person (during a thieft of ammonia for drug production)  A total of 1000 # pounds of ammonia could be released from a railcar over a period of 10 minute.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Terral RiverService Terminal is committed to preventing any losses from the ammonia railcars while they are under its responsibility.  This is accomplished by routine periodic inspections of the railcar (prior to use) to detect any leaks and/or prevent any vandalism.\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the pst five years that:\n-  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor\n\n-  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite death, injuries, evacuations, shelting in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has:\na.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.38\n\nb.  a written energency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nc.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
