This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Arrowhead Gas Plant, located in Coyanosa, Texas operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from oil and gas wells. The Arrowhead Gas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. The Arrowhead Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\r\nHazard Assessment Results.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full inventory of the largest process vessel (V-\r\n404) containing 338,520 pounds of NGL. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.6 mile. No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Arrowhead Gas Plant is a new facility; therefore, this facility has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accid"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Arrowhead Gas Plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Arrowhead Gas Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the Arrowhead Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Arrowhead Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific employees within the Arrowhead Gas Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

The Arrowhead Gas Plant ensures that the process is maintained within instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe Arrowhead Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe Arrowhead Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Panther Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Arrowhead Panther Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidated the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings form these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Arrowhead Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\nContractors\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Arrowhead Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Arrowhead Gas Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) supply contractors with a process overview, (6) information about safety and health hazards, (7) emergency response plan requirements and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment function as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Arrowhead Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes.
