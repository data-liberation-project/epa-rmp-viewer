      "SummaryText": "Foam Packaging, Inc. is committed to ensuring that its operation provides a safe environment for its employees and the community. The company's management maintains an active role in ensuring that environmental compliance takes place through an active review of its safety and environmental plans. A pro-active approach has been adopted through establishing a preventive approach to chemical safety. The preventive program addresses employee participation and training, process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity reviews, compliance audits, and change management. \r\n\r\nThe facility, which utilizes 118,000 square feet, is located on highway 61 South in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The company employs 100 people and operates year round. The primary products consist of polystyrene egg cartons, food and serving trays. Polystyrene crystals are extruded to make rolls of polystyrene, which is subsequently formed using various molds and dies in thermoforming machines. Pentane, an EPA regulated substance, is used to expand the polystyrene crystals. The maximum amount stored at the facility is 34,000 lbs. \r\n\r\nThe operation at Foam Packaging complies with OSHA-PSM rule. In keeping with that rule, the company employs a preventive maintenance program to address hazards within the company's operation. For example, the processes operating procedures have been defined and documented for startup, emergency shutdown, and normal shutdowns. Employee training is an on going process to ensure that those individuals who are a part of the covered process understand the hazards and appropriate responses.\r\n\r\nThe company's risk mitigation and controls consist of :\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPentane monitors located strategically throughout the facility;\r\n\u00bf\tAutomatic shut off valves in the event of delivery system pressure loss our fume detection;\r\n\u00bf\tPrescribed preventive maintenance program for all pumps, motors, pressure valves, conformance tests and pentane sensor calibration;\r\n\u00bf\tDaily visual inspections of pentane delive"

Much of the released pentane evaporated and the rest was dispersed by the fire department with a fire hose. No other releases have occurred. \r\n\r\nAn internal investigation revealed that a pump bearing failed causing pentane release. Pump maintenance records and procedures were reviewed. The pump manufacture was engaged to discus and revise our current change over procedures to include pump to motor shaft alignment. \r\n\r\nFPI uses pentane as a blowing agent to manufacture its products.  It is used in the production process as a gas, but it is stored in liquid form. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the release the company upgraded the pentane delivery system to include a concrete  berm around the pumps for spill containment, additional  pentane sensors to detect  pentane fumes at the tank and external pumping systems. And, control circuitry to disengage pentane flow and delivery into the building when fumes are detected.\r\n\r\nThe company has developed an emergency response system in conjunction with the Vicksburg Emergency Management Center and the City Fire Department. The emergency response plan has a system of internal and external notification should a release occur. Listed in the response plan are the appropriate contacts depending on the severity of the release. The system also provides a procedure for employee evacuation. Periodic dills are conducted to test the evacuation system. In order to prevent accidental release of pentane, the company has incorporated locking shutoff valves for tank filling and fuel return lines. Specific unloading procedures have been prepared for pentane delivery"
