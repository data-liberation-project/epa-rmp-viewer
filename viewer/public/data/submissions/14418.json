Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThis facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to utilize MACtac's Fire Brigade and HazMat Response Team to respond to the emergency, in accordance with MACtac's Emergency Action Plan, with assistance from local emergency authorities, as needed.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe facility is a specialty coater of a variety of papers, films and foils utilizing solvent-based, aqueous-based, hot melt and 100% solid coating systems.  We use propane (a regulated substance) as a back-up fuel to our natural gas supply.  The propane system consists of two 30,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks (ASTs), a propane vaporizer, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nOur worst-case release scenario is a release of propane from failure of the two 30,000-gallon ASTs when filled to the greatest amount allowed (90% at 70 deg F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to USEPA's OCA reference tables, the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint is 0.49 mile.\n\nOur alternative release scenario is a release of propane from a leaky valve, or a piping leak, when the two 30,000-gallon ASTs are half-filled with propane (or a total of 30,000 gallons of propane).  The leaky valve, or piping leak, releases approximately 10% of the propane (or a total of 3,000 gallons of propane released) over a period of 10 minutes, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to USEPA's OCA reference tables, the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint is 0.11 mile.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundaries.\n\n4.

Five-year accident history:\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to utilize MACtac's Fire Brigade and HazMat Response Team to respond to teh emergency, in accordance with MACtac's Emergency Action Plan, with assistance from local emergency authorities, as needed.  We have discussed this policy with the local emergency authorities.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe will schedule regular inspections of the propane system by an external entity."
