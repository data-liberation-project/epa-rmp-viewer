The facility is a combine cycle cogeneration facility that provides 50mW of energy and capacity to the local utility and employs 10 people at this location. Goal Line LP is located approximately 0.15 mile northeast of 1-15.\nManagement commitment to the inspection program includes not only the implementation of the standard operating procedures (SOPS) that define the inspections to be conducted, but also the response to deficiencies that compromise the risk reduction practices identified and implemented under the RMP.  Management is willing to change procedures to provide better systematic support of risk reduction practices.\nThe facitliy has the following toxic substances aboe the threshold quanity on table 1 Federally Regulated Substances List and Threshold quantities for Accidental Release Prevention: Ammonia(conc 20% or greater). 30 % Aqueous Ammonia is stored in a storage tank and is used as Nox abatement (SCR) for Gas Turbine. \n\nGoal Line LP developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address Program 3 requirements in June 1999. Goal Line LP is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Goal Line LP staff are highly trained and utilize modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia for controlling NOx emissions. \n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nGoal Line LP has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Injection Systems. Goal Line LP?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of re"

Aqueous Ammonia\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per regulations one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia that can be stored in the largest equipment item (the storage tank) in ten (10) minutes. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences, the Ammonia Injection System is located outside, and credit for passive mitigation by a dike area of 625 sq. ft and 4 ft deep was taken for the worst-case release scenario.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by the regulations.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 0.14 mg/L.  The results show the off-site areas that will be affected. This worst case release scenario is highly unlikely to occur because of active mitigation measures that can be taken and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled as a release of aqueous ammonia as a result of a rupture of a transfer hose used to fill aqueous ammonia to the SCR ammonia storage tank. The plant spill response kit was used as passive mitigation. \nThe meteorological"

The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.  \nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Goal Line LP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n?Ammonia sensors in the process area \n?Automatic / Manual shutdown\n?Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\n?The history of the Goal Line LP facility (i.e., no ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration and Ammonia Injection Systems.\n \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAs part of the implementation of this Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were implemented by Goal Line LP to manage process safety issues associated with the us"
