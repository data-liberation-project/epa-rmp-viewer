      "SummaryText": "I.Introduction\n\nIn accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs regulation 112r, a study was conducted to determine the possible impact of a chlorine release on the community surrounding the Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant.  If a worst case scenario were to occur at the plant, a 2.54 square mile area East North East of the plant, both inside and outside the town limits of Hillsborough, could be impacted.  Two elementary schools, a small rest home and medium density residential neighborhoods are located in or adjacent to the impact zone.  The probability of such an event is extremely low.  Local topography, vegetation and adjacent surface waters in the vicinity of the plant would mitigate a release to a significant degree.\n\nII.Purpose\n\nThis modeling study was conducted to determine the impact on the surrounding community of a chlorine release at the Town of Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant.\n\nIII.Objectives\n\nSection 112r of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment requires that a site with a listed hazardous substance above a stated threshold quantity must develop a Risk Management Program (RMP).  Chlorine (CAS # 7782-50-5) is a listed hazardous substance, which is presently stored and used in amounts below the threshold quantity at the Town of Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant. The current situation requires that the town purchase and have on hand only two one-ton cylinders at a time with 1200 pounds of chlorine in each cylinder.  This is not economical; for this reason the town desires to store the two full cylinders (4000 pounds) on site. \n       There are several elements in a RMP, including a prevention program identical to OSHA\u00bfs (Process Safety Management Program) and an Emergency Response Plan.  One element is the requirement for an \u00bfOffsite Consequence Analysis.\u00bf  This analysis is achieved by utilizing a modeling study to determine the geographic and demographic impact of two types of releases: a \u00bfworst case\u00bf scenario and an \u00bfalternative release\u00bf (more"

The modeling program RMP*Comp, version 1.07, calculated the potential toxic endpoint of a chlorine release.  CAMEO, ALOHA and MARPLOT programs developed by NOAA, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nOrange County GIS and the LandView V CD-ROM publication provided the mapping and database extracts from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Census were used to determine population density in the potentially affected zones. Additionally they were used to identify sensitive locations, such as schools, churches, daycares and rest homes  in the study area.\n\nCAMEO, ALOHA and the MARPLOT mapping applications were used to determine and depict the geographical extents of the potential chlorine gas plume that may result from a release at the Town of Hillsborough\u00bfs Water Treatment Plant.  This depiction is in the form of a plotted footprint of the plume on the map.  These programs will remain a tool in the Town of Hillsborough\u00bfs resources for future planning and response.  \n\nV.Census Data\n\nThe 2000 U.S. Census Data was used by the LandView program and is presented utilizing the Block Group Uniform Population Density Method.  This method tallies data for each block group polygon that has any portion of the polygon falling within the radius of the circle, but then prorates the results based on the ratio of the area of the circle to the land area of the block group polygons.  This is done to account for the fact that there will be block groups on the circumference of the circle that are only partially within the radius and therefore their population counts need to be apportioned accordingly.  This method assumes a uniform population density throughout the block groups\u00bf land area within the circle. It may have resulted in an over count as the circ"

An undercount for those block groups whose area is only partially inside the radius but whose population is concentrated in the area inside the radius is less likely to be the case as the developed block groups are fairly uniform in this area.  \n\nVI.Site Overview\n\nThe Town of Hillsborough\u00bfs Water Treatment Plant is located approximately 1.5 miles due West South West of downtown Hillsborough.  Six(6) full-time employees work at the plant.  Its geographic coordinates are 36 degrees, 04 minutes, 02.96 seconds north latitude, and 79 degrees, 07 minutes, 28.64 seconds West longitude.\n\nAs part of the chlorination process, gaseous chlorine is added to the water to aid in purification for drinking.  Typically, there will be one (1) one-ton (2,000 lb) cylinder of chlorine connected to the chlorine system.  One (1) other spare cylinder will be on standby.   All of the chlorine cylinders are stored under cover with one side open to the atmosphere.  The enclosure is secured by a gated fence across the opening with a metal shield to protect and conceal tanks from the street. \n\nVII.Environmental Setting\n\n     (a)Topography & Surface Water\n\nThe local topography surrounding a facility will have an effect on any chlorine released.  The RMP*Comp, the computer modeling program used for this study, does not take into account local topography when calculating the release endpoint.  The Hillsborough Water Treatment plant is located in a low area adjacent to the Eno River.  The topography at the site slopes Moderately upward to the north and northeast. The river which runs north to south with a turn to the East about a third of a mile before the plant then east from there on, is bounded by the Occoneechee Mountain to the South and Southeast.  The northern banks of the Eno River are located approximately 477 feet southwest, 630 feet south and 970 feet southeast and 25 to 30 feet topographically down gradient"

The facility is situated in an area adjacent to the Eno River, which is located topographically down gradient from the plant.  Since chlorine is a heavier-than-air gas, it will tend to flow downhill to the river where the chlorine would be consumed by the surrounding trees, vegetation and surface waters.\n\nIf an \u00bfalternative release\u00bf scenario of 180 pounds in 60 minutes were to occur, the endpoint  was calculated to be only one-tenth of a mile or less from the release point.  Only 12 homes are indicated to be within this zone,  employees working at the plant and the town\u00bfs public works and motor pool facility would potentially be affected.  As with the \u00bfworst case\u00bf scenario, local topography, vegetation, adjacent surface waters and prevailing winds from the west should mitigate the effects of a chlorine release at the site.\n\nThe Town of Hillsborough continues to place a high priority on Process Safety Management at the site which is designed to prevent any accidental release to the environment."

The plant\u00bfs elevation is approximately 544 feet above mean sea level.\n\n (b) Vegetation\n\nThe Town of Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant is located in a fairly well-vegetated area adjacent to the Eno River.  Vegetation in the area of a chlorine release tends to react with the gas, absorbing it and mitigating the effects of the release.  \n\n (c) Prevailing Winds\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service Raleigh Office, the prevailing winds in the area of the Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant are from the southwest.\n\nVIII.Modeling Results\n\nA \u00bfworst case\u00bf (one-ton chlorine release over 10 minutes) scenario and an \u00bfalternative case\u00bf (180 pound chlorine release over 60 minutes) scenario were studied.  An endpoint of 3 parts per million (ppm) was used to define the boundaries of the toxic clouds formed by the modeled scenarios.  This end point concentration was fixed by the Environmental Protective Agency (EPA) as part of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment.\n\n      (a)  Worst Case Scenario\n\nFor the \u00bfWorst Case\u00bf scenario, the EPA requires that the largest vessel in the system lose its contents in 10 minutes.  At the Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant, this requirement equates to a full one-ton cylinder of chlorine, stored outdoors, emptying its contents in 10 minutes.  This was the basis chosen for the \u00bfWorst Case\u00bf scenario at the site.\n\nThe inputs used for the \u00bfworst case\u00bf scenario modeling were as follows:\n\nChemical Released - Chlorine\nAmount Released - 200 pounds/minute for 10 minutes (2,000 lbs total)\nWind Speed - 3.4 miles/hour\nWind Direction 0 From the Southwest\nTemperature - 77 degrees F\nRelative Humidity - 50%\nCloud Cover - 5 tenths\nStability Class - F\nGround Roughness - Urban\nMitigation - Some (release to indoor atmosphere inside plant)\nEndpoint - 3 parts per million\n\nThe modeling results at this point show that a \u00bfworst case\u00bf scenario release could have a moderately significant impact on the surrounding area, depending on the wind direction.

A 2.54 square mile area in West Hillsborough located approximately .50 to .75 miles east of downtown Hillsborough is within the potential impact zone.\n\nA study of topographic maps and LandView data for the area indicated natural features contained within this zone, including the Eno River and several tributaries to the river.  The river is bordered to the south and east by the Eno Mountain which protects a good portion of the town from any release of this nature. Public receptors located within and near the potential impact zone include Residences, Churches and Business within the impact zone and Central Elementary School at .98 miles, Hillsborough Elementary School at 1.16miles just outside the zone northwest of the plant.  Also adjacent to the site are the town\u00bfs motor pool and public works buildings. It is estimated that a population of approximately 1,300 people in 520 house holds may reside within this 0.9 mile radius.  The Norfolk Southern Railway runs west to east trough the impact zone and is 16 feet higher in elevation than the water treatment plant. The majority of the impact zone steadily gains in elevation as you travel northwest from the plant. The potentially impacted area is shown on the map included in this report as figure 1.\n\nIn reality, however, the effects of local topography, vegetation and adjacent surface waters (see Section 4.0 of this report) will mitigate the impacts of a release at this site to a significant degree.  Chlorine is classified as a heavier-than-air gas, and as such tends to naturally flow downhill towards\nlow lying areas.  In a little to no wind situation at the plant, a chlorine release would tend to flow east through dense vegetation, downhill and along the Eno River, it may remain in or around the water until it dissipates.\n\nFigure 2 is a MARPLOT image which depicts the potential geographical extent of the probable chlo"

This amount is based upon losing 3 pounds of chlorine per minute for 60 minutes after which time the HAZMAT team should arrive to stop the leak.  The 180 pound release is based upon a hypothetical vapor leak that can occur at a pigtail or a valve.  The site\u00bfs safety experience with managing chlorine has been excellent.  As a result, the 180-pound release was judged to be representative of a significant chlorine vapor leak and was used for the alternative case scenario.\n\nThe model inputs used for the \u00bfalternative case\u00bf scenario were:\n\nChemical Released - Chlorine\nAmount Released - 3 pounds/minute for 60 minutes (180 lbs total)\nWind Speed - 10 miles/hour\nWind Direction - From the Southwest\nTemperature - 77 degrees F\nRelative Humidity - 50%\nCloud Cover - 5 tenths\nStability Class - D\nGround Roughness - Urban\nMitigation - Some (release to semi enclosed structure)\nEnd point - 3 parts per million\n\nFor the \u00bfalternative case\u00bf scenario above, the potential endpoint was calculated to be less than one-tenth of a mile (<176 yards) from the release point.

In the unlikely event that a major chlorine release occurs, the Town of Hillsborough\u00bfs Emergency Response Plan will be initiated to address the actions required by the emergency response organizations to protect the community.\n\nThe Town\u00bfs Emergency Response Plan for the Water Treatment Plant addresses communications with neighboring residents in the event of a release that may result in exposure to chlorine gas and/or chlorine odor.  Notification to the population possibly affected by a chlorine emergency will be facilitated through the town\u00bfs CodeRed Emergency Notification System. This system is designed to call the resident\u00bfs phone and will broad cast a message recorded by the staff member responsible for launching the call.  Specific instructions for \u00bfSheltering-in-Place\u00bf, \u00bfEvacuation\u00bf (to include evacuation routes), and alternate means to receive information concerning shelter locations and \u00bfAll-Clear\u00bf information will be given at that time.  The County of Orange has the same system covering the area giving some redundancy.  Other means that will be used is the EAS (Emergency Alert System) through local Radio, TV stations and the National Weather Service.  Local News station broadcast may preempt programming in an effort to get the word out.\n\nAny release of chlorine that triggers an emergency response will initially be handled by the Orange Rural Fire Department, Hillsborough Fire Marshal/Emergency Management Coordinator, Hillsborough Police Department and Orange County Emergency Services. The primary responding agency will be that of the Orange Rural Fire Department who protects the town u"

Most of the west and central Hillsborough neighborhoods are located in close proximity to the impact zone.  Downtown Hillsborough should not be affected, as the estimated impact zone is located over 1/2 mile to the west of the city center.  2 elementary schools were identified as concerns due to their close proximity to the projected worst case plume.   Additionally, a small number of businesses and approximately 1,300 people may be located within this 0.9-mile radius.\n\nThe probability of a \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario is extremely low.  The staff at the water treatment plant has an excellent safety record in dealing with chlorine. Additionally, the plant has two factors that will positively influence any chlorine release.  First, all chlorine cylinders are located in a strong semi-enclosed building.  This building will retain the chlorine enough to activate the chlorine alarm system giving staff time for evacuation and no"
