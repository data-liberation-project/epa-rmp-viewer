Ammonia refrigeration system was recently activated to start pulling down the cold room temperatures. Suction pressure was in the 40-45 psig range and the discharge pressure was in the 120-130 psig range. Cold room evaporators were sequentially being activated. There was no water chiller cooling operation. Only one or two compressors were operational. System operating parameters were normal. An Incident Investigation was initiated by a team of qualified personnel. A copy of the detailed Incident Investigation is maintained onsite and readily available upon request.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nTaylor Farms California facility is a non-responding facility. Facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to the RMP Program Coordinator. The RMP Program Coordinator is responsible for assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The RMP Program Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a"

An emergency control box and diffusion tank allow system pressure to be relieved manually. All of the pressure relief valves at the facility are tied to an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one accident involving anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that resulted in onsite and offsite consequences (deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage). \n\nOn April 13, 2022, insulated metal panel (IMP) wall caught fire during the welding of stainless steel window frame opening on the wall. As a result, processing rooms 1-2-3, Engine room, electrical room were completely destroyed and approximately 30,000 lbs. of ammonia were released and burned out in a period of 20 hour. Remaining part of the ammonia either released to diffusion tank or pumped out to nurse tanks. There was no injury or death. However, there was significant property damage on-site and on site evacuation and off-site Shelter-in-Place were ordered as a safety measure.\n\nThe fire started at the IMP wall between Processing rooms 2 & 3 during the equipment installation as part of the seasonal preparation in April 2022. Contractor was welding stainless steel window opening frame to the IMP wall for the process equipment where the IMP wall insulation caught fire. Fire quickly progressed through the insulation and reached to the roof structure which is made out of wood frame. IMP wall constructed of insulation sandwiched between metal panels which prevented any fire suppression water reaching the flames. Fire later on progressed throughout the process rooms and engine room. All ammonia was quickly pumped down to engine room vessels at the beginning of the fire but signific"

International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \u201cAmmonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\u201d located in Appendix 12.1, describe equipment details.\n\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for the refrigeration system is provided in Chapter 8 of the RMP Binder.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTaylor Farms California facility maintains a release prevention program to prevent or mitigate releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix 16 - Incident Investigation of the RMP Binder.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency reporting and monitoring and assisting local emergency responders in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the machinery room for shutting down the Main System. Ammonia detectors are installed in all of the refrigerated rooms and the engine room. Th"

These systems are moved to Yuma, AZ facility for winter operations, from November to April.\n\nThe total quantity of ammonia currently at the site is approximately 49,960 lb. Public receptors are located within the worst-case accidental release toxic endpoint area.\n\nThe compressors have safety cutouts that will shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All pressure vessels and the compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. All low side vessels that are connected directly to the suction of compressor is installed with high level float switches that shuts down compressors upon detection of high liquid level in the vessel. All cold storage warehouses and main system engine room are installed with ammonia sensors that triggers an alarm upon detection of ammonia vapor in the vicinity of the sensor. Refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of emergency situation or any high pressure, high temperatu"

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTaylor Farms California facility conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response.\n\nOn-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nTaylor Farms California uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 of the RMP binder for the drawings showing the facility location map and site plan.\n\nTaylor Farms California has over 10,000 lbs. of ammonia in the largest single refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in product storage cooling, vacuum cooling, and water chilling operations. There are four (4) separate standalone refrigeration systems at the facility. These processes are (1) Main System, (1) 12-Palette Vacuum Cooling System, and (2) 24-Palette Vacuum Cooling Systems. Only Main System has ammonia quantity that is above federal threshold quant"
