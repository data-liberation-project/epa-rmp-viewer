In the event the monitors detect a release, an alarm will sound alerting trained personnel to don the necessary safety equipment to mitigate the concern. If warranted, Eagle-Picher will notify the local fire department and request assistance.\n\nIn the worse case scenario involving a BF3 release at the tube trailer, the Boron Department has trained personnel in the prevention and mitigation of a boron trifluoride leak from this equipment.  Our operators have been trained by our supplier specifically on how to address leaks from this storage trailer.  Our trained personnel have the necessary personnel protective equipment and replacement parts to address any process leaks described in the alternative release scenario. \n\nIn the event of a release that may potential affect area offsite, Boron Department personnel will notify the proper local authorities as outlined in our Emergency Response Plan to inform them of the situation and advise accordingly. Boron Department officials have met with local officials and outlined a course of action for informing the public.\n\nThe tube trailer for the storage of Boron Trifluoride is designed to meet Department of Transportation standard for toxic gases.  The tube trailer is maintained by our supplier, Allied Signal, and is requalified and hydrostatic tested every five years in addition routine inspection before and after it leaves the Allied Signal facility.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNo process modifications have occurred in this area that involves production.  Minor modifications and written procedural changes have occurred as a result of the Process Safety Management program."

Employers working in the covered process are routinely retrained every three years in the operating procedures as required by the PSM standard.\n\nThe covered process gets routinely reviewed by operating staff.  A process hazard analysis must be preformed at least every five years and in the event of specific process modifications to identify process concerns and develop solutions for them.  In addition, all fourteen elements of the PSM program are reviewed every three years to ensure the program is in compliance with all OSHA PSM requirements.\n\nIn the covered process, the Boron Department has eight operators that are trained under the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) 40-hour operations level.  This program requires that operators be trained in the hazardous chemical awareness and emergency response procedures.  These individuals are trained to respond to hazardous chemical releases and implement proper responses to minimize any affects on human health and the environment.  All HAZWOPER operators receive an annual eight-hour refresher training to maintain their certification.\n\nPractices at the Boron facility to prevent chemical releases include preventative maintenance program on covered process equipment and hourly process equipment inspections to ensure there are no equipment leaks and equipment is functioning properly.  In addition, the covered process is monitored through process sensors and alarms on a continuous basis to alert operators of any process disruptions so that they can immediately be abated.  These same sensors can also automatically shut the operation down as well with minimal impact on the environment.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDNET HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents at this facility in the past five years involving boron trifluoride.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE"

The Company's Policy on Environmental and Health and Safety Responsibility and Ethics requires employees and facilities to conduct operations in conformance with all applicable laws and regulations and in a manner that will protect employees, the community and the environment.  This Policy is implemented by our facility through specific programs designed to assure safe and responsible handling of all chemicals throughout the manufacturing process.\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThis facility processes boron trifluoride to produce enriched boron compounds.  The boron trifluoride is stored on site in the transportation vehicle, which is a tube trailer consisting of six tubes co-located on the trailer and direct piped to the production area.  Each tube contains 3,167 pounds of BF3 gas.  However, only one tube is actually open or in use at any one time.\n\n\nWORSE CASE\n\nAFTOX dispersion modeling predicts that the worst-case release of 3,167 pounds over 10 minutes would adversely affect an area extending 2.55 miles from the release.  Census data from 1990 indicate that 529 people reside in this area.\n\nAFTOX further predicts that a less serious alternate-case release of 311 pounds/minute would adversely affect an area extending 1320 feet, which would just reach the nearest residence.  The worst-case affected area includes schools and residences, whereas the alternative-case affected area includes no public receptors.  No release scenario is predicted to affect any environmental receptors.\n\n\nRELEASE PROTECTION\n\nThe boron trifluoride process area has been regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) since 1994.  The facility has successfully implemented all fourteen elements of the PSM program for the covered process.\n\nThis facility has developed wri"
