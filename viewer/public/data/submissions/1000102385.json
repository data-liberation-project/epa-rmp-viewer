Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous materials.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe GAF Isocyanurate Foam facility in Gainesville, Texas has not had any incidents to date.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nOn-site emergency response teams train to respond to releases to effectively minimize the release.  Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, sheriff, rescue, etc.). Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams.  Additional training with outside organizations is also conducted.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nNo planned changes to safety system have been identified at this time."

      "SummaryText": "PROCESS DESCRIPTION - GAF Isocyanurate Foam Process\nRaw chemical materials (MDI, polyol, catalysts, surfactant, fire retardant, minor ingredients, and hydrocarbon blowing agent) are transported to the facility by rail car and/or truck. The chemicals are transferred from the rail cars or trucks to individual storage tanks except for some minor ingredients, which are stored in drums or totes. The Pentane tank holds 35,500 gallons and there may be one railcar waiting to be unloaded. \n\nAll of the ingredients, except for MDI, are blended in-line according to the foam formulation and mixed using a dynamic mixer. That polyol based mixture and the MDI are pumped separately to 3 pairs of high pressure pumps. In some cases, a preblend of the polyol and some of the ingredients might be made and used in place of straight polyol. \n\nThe high pressure pumps boost the pressures of the polyol mixture and the MDI streams and supply 3 mix heads. Within the mix heads, the polyol mixture and MDI streams are brought together at high pressure and intimately mixed. That mixture immediately begins to foam. The liquid foam is poured onto a facer material in evenly spaced intervals and the foam and facer travel to the laminator to be heated. At the laminator entrance, a top facer is brought down onto the foam. In the laminator, the foam rapidly expands to the pre-designated thickness and solidifies. Next the foam moves down the line to be trimmed and cut to pre-measured lengths. Once the foam is cut to length, it is stacked, wrapped, and cured in a warehouse. It is later shipped to customers.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nGAF has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies, and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases. These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices. Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure t"
