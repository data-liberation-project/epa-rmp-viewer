This training includes the safe handling of regulated substances under the rule.\n\n\n\nBPU has also developed and maintained a risk management policy that contains general safety rules.  Though these rules do not specifically address the covered processes and their regulated substances, compliance with the general rules significantly reduces the potential for accidental releases of the regulated substances.  This facility complies with industry-standard practices for water treatment plants that use chlorine in bulk. \n\n\n\nAs for emergency response, BPU has established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and action.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.  In general, BPU plant employees would deal only with releases of a small amount of a regulated substance.  If the release is determined to be large or if the chemical is stored outside or has migrated outside from a release indoors, BPU would immediately notify the Fire Department and Wyandotte County Emergency Management.\n\n\n\nBPU management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment at this facility and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in this document.\n\n\n\nFacility and regulated substance   \n\nBPU's Nearman WTP is a 54-million-gallon per day plant that treats raw water from underground wells in the Missouri River flood plain and provides drinking water to the community.  It does this throu"

The treated water, now ready for use by the public, is transferred to a large reservoir and pumped into the distribution system. \n\n\n\nThe regulated substances stored, handled, and used at this facility is chlorine. The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 32 containers on site.  All of the chlorine containers are stored inside of a building.  The chlorine building is equipped with a scrubber system.  \n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility's prevention program for chlorine complies with EPA's 40 CFR part 68 rule for program 2 processes.  To maintain this compliance, BPU has in place many procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an employee-training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered processes.  The technological safeguards include controls, sensors, alarms, and industry-standard systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of chlorine.\n\n\n\nShould the prevention program fail to prevent a release, the WTP is equipped with engineering controls designed to minimize the effect of the release on the surrounding community.  For chlorine, the storage containers are kept inside of a building to mitigate the effects of a release.  The plant also has a scrubber capable of neutralizing one ton of chlorine, the amount stored in the largest single container onsite.  The scrubber is maintained on a regular basis to ensure proper operation if needed during a chlorine release. \n\n\n\nFor the worst-case and alternative analyses, the EPA's RMP Comp (TM) was used.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been three minor incidents at the WTP where very small amounts of chlorine were released due to either a failed gasket and/or faulty pigtail or associated flexible"

In all aforementioned scenarios, the scrubber was allowed to run and mitigate any presence of chlorine.\n\n\n\nIn July, 2015 there were two minor incidents that did not release chlorine to the outside of the storage building. These minor incidents were noted and are similar to previous releases where a pigtail to the gas connection of a chlorine cylinder leaked. The other minor incident was a connection to the evaporator which spilled a small quantity <1 pound of liquid and gas chlorine. In each case, the leak detector alarms worked and the scrubber was automatically engaged.\n\n\n\nIn March, 2011, during routine operator rounds, a chlorine odor was detected in the chlorine room.  Internal emergency procedures were followed and plant personnel notified Hazmat and the local fire department.  Crews arrived on-site and were able to isolate the leak.  After follow-up investigation, it was determined that the leak was from a failed fuse plug on a full cylinder.  Approximately 1 pound of chlorine was released to the chlorine room.  The scrubber evacuated all presence of chlorine as designed.  No releases occurred to the environment, no accidents, deaths, or injuries were reported.  Follow-up items included: the addition of a new chlorine detector on the wall outside the chlorine room, routine practice with \"B\" kit application and review of procedures.      \n\n  \n\nEmergency response program  \n\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency action plan that is coordinated with local response agencies, such as the Fire Department and local HAZMAT team.  The goals of the plan are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of the releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  It is also submitted to the Fire Department for review and comment.  T"

The range of alarm setting concentrations will help determine an increase or decrease of chlorine level in a room during an emergency.\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\n\n\nDuring the development of the risk management plan, hazard reviews were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or is being considered and evaluated for implementation.  This evaluation process will provide all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes.\n\n"
