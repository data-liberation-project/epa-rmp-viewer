              "Description": "CEMP- Comphrensive Emergency Management Plan is the basis EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT GROUP RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe corporate response to an emergency is vested in the Emergency Management Group (EMG).  The EMG is responsible for implementing the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) for response to and recovery from an emergency.  Through the leadership of the General Manager, the EMG strategically applies corporate resources to ensure that PWC's services are maintained during and restored following an emergency.\nThe EMG's responsibilities include:\n? Gathering information to determine the actual and potential impact of the incident on the affected facility, its personnel, the environment, PWC services, and the public\n? Taking decisive actions to reduce risks, minimize losses, and maintain PWC services\n? Communicating with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as private organizations\n? Applying resources to effectively respond to and recover from the emergency\n It is not the EMG's role to coordinate the physical mitigation of an emergency at a PWC facility, such as a fire or chemical release.  Physically mitigating the incident, including incident management, is vested in local emergency responders.  Until the incident is mitigated, the role of the EMG is to support emergency responders and emergency management agencies and to provide the public with information.\n When the emergency requires the activation of the Emergency Operations Center, it is expected that all members of the Emergency Management Group will report to the EOC to obtain an understanding of the situation.  If the General Manager and a specific emergency management group member judge that it is of value to have that member proceed to the scene, the member will be allowed to go to the scene.  However, he/she will remain in radio communication with the EOC at all times.\n  Organization\n The EMG is organized to include management representation from each PWC Group.  The EMG members function as a unified management team under the leadership of the General Manager, and, in addition, coordinate the resources of their respective groups.  Upon declaration of an emergency, the EMG assembles at the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to plan, organize, and lead the corporate response and recovery.

Referenced documents, such as the PWC Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, Emergency Action Plan, Spill Prevention, Containment and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) all plans are available for inspection by authorized individuals.\n\nOur Process will soon be operating with the use of non-RMP regulated chemicals.  By the summer of 2000 both of our chemicals will be substituted with safer, less hazardous chemicals.  Both of our \"new\" chemicals will better for the public.\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of the CCWRF to prevent accidental releases through the use of preventive maintenance programs, testing, calibrations, routine maintenance, inspections, and replacement of equipment as necessary and training personnel.  A work order system is in place for employees to formally report deficiencies and track until rectified.\n\nCCWRF's overall policy is to provide a safe environment for all employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors.  This extends to the design, training, and implementation of a program, which will result in saving lives and reducing property damage during an emergency.\n\nIt is also CCWRF's policy to operate in an environmentally responsible manner consistent with environmental knowledge, policies, procedures and regulations that best serve the needs of employees, the community, and the company.  Operations of the CCWRF are designed so as not to adversely affect the environment of the surrounding area during emergency situations or normal operating periods.\n\nEmployees at the CCWRF attempt to prevent all emergencies from ever occurring.  In emergency situations employees are to exit the facility, and notify the appropriate emergency response a"

Rescue and medical activities have priority over all other actions.\n\nIt is the emergency response policy of the facility to immediately notify Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency CEMA, LEPC, and the SERC of any regulated substances in excess of the reportable qty.  \n\nPWC Employees are only trained at the awareness levels within the HAZOP system.  If possible, employees are allowed to eliminate the release source (i.e. closing valves, shutting down pumps, etc.) or contain the release.    The CCWRF relies on the local HazMat team to respond to related emergencies.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Facility\n\nThe Cross Creek WRF is located on the eastern edge of the city limits on the Service road adjacent to US 301Business (Eastern Blvd). The site is situated on the western side of US 301 between the Cape Fear River and Big Cross Creek.  Big Cross Creek is a large creek with substantial volume of moving water and is located adjacent to the SW side of the facility boundary.  \n\nCCWRF is a water reclamation facility at which wastewater is collected in the City of Fayetteville's sewer system is treated prior to being discharged to the Cape Fear River.   This plant is capable of treated up to 22 million gallons per day.\n\nChemical Storage\nThe CCWRF uses Chlorine and SO2 within its process.  Both are RMP regulated chemicals that we store in an enclosed chemical storage area.  This area is enclosed with brick walls equipped automatic ventilation fans to which  provide secondary containment for these substances.  These areas are also equipped with chemical sensors that alert our operations control center of releases.  These alarms are periodically calibrated to insure the accuracy of their sensors.  \n\nChlorine is the primary disinfectant agent used in the treatment process.  It is an oxidizer that i"
