Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSun Tech stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a rgulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to preent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSun Tech provides chlorination service to swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one-ton containers to twenty pound net capacity service cylinders.  The twenty pound cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to chloriate customer swimming pools.  The facility operates five days a week (M-F), eight hours per day, and fifty weeks per year.\n\nThe Fill Yard is used exclusively for the storage and repackaging of chlorine.  The yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of chlorine delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of empty one-ton containers.\n\nThe Fill Yard is not exposed to vehicular traffic.  The Fill Yard houses all of the chlorine containers and is locked after normal working hours.  Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the building.  Container handling and storage is per Section 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.\n\nThe amount of chlorine packaged per month is seasonally dependent.  The summer months, for obvious reasons, are the busiest swim times of the year.Consequently, the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period.  Sun Tech stores"

This amount includes the content of 1.5 one-ton containers, 50 twenty-pound cylinders, and the one-ton container in the repackaging process.\n\nChlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Delivery of one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The one-ton containers, up to a maximum of 1.5, are stored in the Fill Yard.\n\nOff-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist or a lift gate.  The one-ton containers are placed on the rails in the Fill Yard.  The one-ton containers are manually rolled to the desired location and chocked to prevent movement.  Empty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are chained or strapped into place in an upright position.  The company has administrative procedures in place that limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than 1.5 one-ton containers and 50 each twenty pound cylinders for a total of 4000 pounds.  The procedure, in part, requires the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure tha an order and delivery of a one-ton containers will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 4000 pounds.\n\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine in small diameter, short length piping is directed into a liquid caustic absorption scrubber.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.  The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in accordance with the Chlorine Institutes Pamphlet 17- Cylinder and Ton Container Procedure for Chlorine Packaging.  \n\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.

Filling commences by opening the one-ton container liquid valve, the cylinder valve, and various other proprietary and confidential steps in the transfer assembly.  After filling, which is indicated by weight on the pan scale reaching the desired value, the cylinder valve and liquid chlorine valve are closed, and the transfer tubing is evacutated by means of the eductor in the chlorine absorption system, prior to disonnecting the full service cylinder.  The caustic solution comprising the absorption medium is prevented from being sucked back into the system using the unique design of the proprietary and confidential  chlorine packaging system.\n\nThe repackaging system is operated under pressure from the chlorine container.   Only a very small amount of residual chlorine remains in the lines after fill to be routed to the caustic scrubber.  Operational and test procedures are in place which ensure that the scrubber system is operating correctly.  Chlorine is not vented to the atmosphere under any circumstances.

Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario must consider the largest quantity of a regulated substance handled on site in a single vessel at any time, taking into account administrative controls on the vessel's contents and usage as per 40 CFR Part 68 Section 68.25.  A one-ton container of chlorine is the largest vessel in the chlorine repacakaging system.  The one-ton container is, at most, filled with 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the one-ton container of chorine is the relase of the 2000 lbs of chlorine at the rate of 110 lbs per minute, for 10 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 3ppm for the worst case scenario release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the one-ton containers of chlorine is a small leak occuring in the packing material around the valve stem of the vapor phase valve located on the one-ton container.  There are no passive or active mitigation measures that would reduce the amount of chlorine released or treatment system to which released chlorine would be directed.\n\nIt is assumed that the release would continue for a period of sixty minutes at a release rate of 33 lbs per minute.  In this senario, the distance to the endpoint will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict to a minimum, the amount of chlorine lost from a one-ton container if an accidental release were to occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational proceures of the stationary source.\n\n3d.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine process system and the related activities and equipment represents the facility's main active commitment to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe emergency response program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evacutate the facility and await the arrival of local emergency responders at the evacutaion assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) incorporates this response into the Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are planned to be implemented over the next year.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine process system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substance."
