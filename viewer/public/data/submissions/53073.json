Products, Inc. is a manufacturing facility that produces a variety of hair products, including Isoplus\u00ae, Upturn\u00ae, Black Magic\u00ae, Oil of K\u00ae, and Healthy Solutions\u00bf Plus. In the manufacturing processes, J.M. Products utilizes two regulated flammable mixtures (A-46 and D-152/A-31) in quantities that exceed EPA\u00bfs threshold of 10,000 pounds. A-46 is composed of Isobutane and Propane, and D-152/A-31 is composed of Isobutane and Difluoroethane.   J.M. Product's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by the development and implementation of an accidental release prevention program (Process Safety Management Program). \r\n\r\nJ.M. Products\u00bf policy in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of a flammable mixture is to evacuate the facility immediately and to contact the local fire department as well as the local emergency agencies.  J.M. Products adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of these flammable mixtures of chemicals.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nJ.M. Products complies with the Level 3 Prevention Program of EPA\u00bfs standard 40 CFR 68, or Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program through compliance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Program (29 CFR 1910.119), or PSM Program. The PSM Program is an extensive prevention program that was developed to prevent hazardous chemical releases. The PSM Plan is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis, employee training, hot work procedures, incident investigations, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, pre-safety startup, contractor safety, emergency planning and respo"

The mechanical integrity element of the program includes scheduled inspections and tests of equipment and monitoring devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment. Preventative maintenance and replacement policies of parts and equipment ensure that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to a release incident. All elements of the PSM Program help to ensure that uncontrolled releases of the propellant mixtures are prevented.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nJ.M. Products has had one accidental release of propellant in the past five years.  The event involved a release of approximately 86 pounds of propellant, which lead to an explosion and fire.  No onsite or offsite deaths, or injuries occurred.  No offsite evacuations, sheltering in place, off site property damage, or environmental damage occurred as a result of the release event.  The release resulted in a fire which caused significant property damage to one section of JM Product\u00bfs building.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nJ.M. Products has developed an emergency response plan (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38) that includes provisions to evacuate the facility in the event of an uncontrolled release of either flammable mixture. J.M. Products has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on its emergency response plan, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, the local fire department will be contact and they will respond to the release.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nJ.M.

In addition, new process equipment and controls were installed in mid 2008.  Additional process equipment and safety controls are scheduled for early 2009.   Periodic auditing of the PSM Program ensures that the program is implemented properly. The management of change procedures ensures that any system changes or modifications are evaluated and necessary safety precautions and or safety improvements are made before the process is placed into operation."
