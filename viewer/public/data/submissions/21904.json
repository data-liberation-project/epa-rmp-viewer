The facility policy\n    The owners, management, and employees of Farmers Union Oil Co. are committed to the prevention\noff any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire company of other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2.  Facility information\n\n     a. The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n     b.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production      \n          nutrients.\n     c.  The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The        \n         maximum quantity handled would be the 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.   The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage\n            tank releases as a gas over 10 minutes the maximum quanity released would be 140,196\n            pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as\n            limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM)\n            is 1.1 miles.\n\n        b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely incident is a release from a break\n            in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .41 miles.\n\n4.    The accidental release prevention program.\n\n        The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling\n        of Anhyd"

The Five-Year Accident History.\n\n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n         a.  have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facitity: nor\n\n         b.  to our knowledge, have resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place,\n              property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n          Safety improvent is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to\n          assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\n          safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
