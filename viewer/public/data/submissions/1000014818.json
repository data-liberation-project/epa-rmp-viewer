In the event of an emergency, ALERIS has\n\ncoordinated emergency response efforts with the Coldwater Fire Department and the City of Coldwater's Local\n\nEmergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nALERIS manufactures aluminum sows and molten aluminum in crucibles from various types of recycled aluminum scrap. At the time of this submittal, ALERIS is subject to the requirements under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions since the facility maintains chlorine on-site in a quantity greater than the 2,500 pounds threshold. Chlorine is used at the facility to remove impurities from the recycled aluminum.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTo meet the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, ALERIS has implemented  the RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nALERIS has developed an emergency response plan in accordance with the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. Additionally, ALERIS has coordinated emergency response with both the Coldwater Fire Department and the City of Coldwater's LEPC. In the event of an emergency, ALERIS will follow the procedures outlined in the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nALERIS is currently evaluating and processing recommendations from the recent process hazard analysis performed for the chlorine operation.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History \n\nThere have not been any accidents involving chlorine at the facility. \n\n"
