Safety and Environmental Managers have been assigned to ensure safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals. The site has developed an Emergency Response Plan and trained its personnel to ensure prompt evacuations during an ammonia emergency. The Plan has specific written evacuation and reporting procedures in place to protect Fresno Winery employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Fresno Winery facility covered by this RMP is located at 7409 W. Central Avenue in Fresno, California. The facility produces grape juice that is fermented into wine. The facility uses sulfur dioxide for bacterial control and anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration. \nA stationary anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used for chilling wine. The Ammonia System at the facility has fifteen chillers and contains a total of less than 150,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Refrigeration equipment and piping are located outdoors. Based on this quantity of anhydrous ammonia, the facility is subject to the Program 3 RMP requirements.\nThe facility also uses a sulfur dioxide system located in the North East part of the winery. Sulfur dioxide is stored in two 1-ton cylinders and is used to supply and fill smaller hand-held sulfur dioxide cylinders, having capacities of 25 and 100 pounds. The sulfur dioxide is injected from the smaller cylinders into the wine to control the bacteria. This system holds a maximum of 4,250 pounds of sulfur dioxide, and is currently exempt from RMP requirements.\n\nNote: The amount of sulfur dioxide onsite (4,250 pounds) is below the threshold amount required by the federal RMP regulation. The Sanger facility has not received formal notification fr"

The ammonia release did not result in any onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or in any off-site environmental damage, or evacuations. The single ammonia release did require sheltering in place of 4 individuals. The incident was reported to the proper authorities and they responded. A full investigation was completed after the incident, and it was determined that the cause of the incident was due to human error, resulting in over pressuring the system. Subsequent to the incident review, the operating procedures were amended and the applicable personnel"

The ERP, kept at the Plant Office, describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release. It details evacuation procedures and response procedures for the mitigation of minor ammonia releases. The Fresno County Fire Department will generally respond to any non-minor leaks or leaks that cannot be repaired. Employees are trained to this ERP and, in the event of a non-minor leak, will evacuate and take initial life safety precautions, as described in the ERP.\n\n\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on studies conducted during preparation of this RMP, the Fresno Winery facility plans to implement many changes in their procedures, practices, policies, including several minor equipment adjustments to ensure continued safe operations. These items were discovered during a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) that was conducted at the facility December 2, 2004. All of the changes and adjustments have been enumerated in the facility\u00bfs PHA document, dated December 2004.\n\n\tRMP Review and Update\n\nThis RMP will be reviewed at least once every five years and updated as appropriate.
