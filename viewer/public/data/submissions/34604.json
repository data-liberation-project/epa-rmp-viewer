      "SummaryText": "Solite Corporation operates a lightweight aggregate manufacturing operation on an approximate 917 acre parcel of land, located in Arvonia, VA.  The facility operates 4 rotary kilns and associated raw and finished material crushing operations in the production of lightweight aggregate.  Raw material is mined on site and processed in a series of crushing and screening operations in preparation for sale or for the production of lightweight aggregate.\n\nAn approximate 0.56 acre parcel of land wholly contiguous to the Solite facility is occupied by a fully permitted RCRA waste fuel stroage tank facility.  This facility, including the storage tanks and associate unloading and pumping equipment, is owned and operated by Giant Resource Recovery, Inc. (GRR).  Liquid waste fuel is received at the GRR facility via tanker truck from off-site and pumped into one of several waste fuel blending tanks.  In addition, containerized waste, including waste aerosol cans, are received via box trailer and processed in a can processing operation.  The containerized waste is crushed and separated into three streams: 1) drained liquid contents, 2) propellant gases (if applicable), and 3) scrap steel.  The liquid waste fuels are blended to meet burning specifications for use as fuel at the adjacent Solite facility for the production of lightweight aggregate.  The propellant gases are also used as a fuel in the Solite process.\n\nThe GRR facility consists of 15 storage tanks, ancillary equipment, and the container management facility including the can processing operation.  Waste fuels (liquid and gaseous) are transferred to the Soltie facility via pipeline.  The GRR storage tanks and can processing units are interconnected via pipelines and are also considered co-located within the facility and therefore, for purposes of compliance with 40 CFR Part 68, the Solite facility is considered to have one regulated process, the GRR tank farm and container processing facility.\n\nThe thershold quantity det"

      "SummaryText": "ermination performed at the Solite facility used several conservative assumptions as outlined in the EPA RMP guidance document for warehousing (1/99).  From this threshold determination, the facility developed a list of regulated substances that could potentially (although unlikely) be present in the regulated process above the applicable threshold quantity as follows:  acrylontrile, allyl alcohol, ammonia, carbon disulfide, chloroform, methyl chloride, methyl mercaptan, titanium tetrachloride, and vinyl acetate monomer.\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed in accordance with EPA guidance to determine the distances to the endpoints for each substance.  From this analysis it was determined that the facility did not have any public receptors within the distance to the endpoint for the worst case toxic release scenaro.  In addition, the facility has not had any reportable accidents under RMP and therefore, the facility is subject to the RMP Program 1 requirements.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that although the Solite facility is subject to the Program 1 requirements of RMP (and is reporting accordingly), to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances at the stationary source, it has implemented an internal risk management program (and associated prevention program), using the Program 2 Prevention Program requirements as a guide.  The Risk Management Program is intended to address all potential hazards and comply with the general duty clause of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe Solite prevention program includes 1) the development of a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program, 2) the performance of a hazard review, 3) the development of standard operating procedures for the regulated process (including maintenance procedures), 4) the implementaion of a risk management program training plan, 5) the performance of compliance audits and incident investigations, and 6) procedures for maintaining and updating s"

These plans are maintained on site and have been coordinated with the local emergency response agencies.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the facility include ongoing training of employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the regulated process.  The training incorporates, but is not limited to, safe handling practices, hazard prevention, and emergency response.  Regular safety meetings are held at the facility to discuss site safety procedures and continually evaluate existing safety procedures.  Off-site contractors are provided safety training as appropriate and response equipment is regularly maintained for immediate use if necessary."
