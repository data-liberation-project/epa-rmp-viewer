If by railcar, the railcar is temporarily staged on the Facilities rail spur so that Facility personnel can offload the anhydrous ammonia to the onsite stationary storage tanks (Covered Process 2). Up to eight (8) 34,000-gallon railcars could be staged on the Facility rail spur.  The Regulatory & Safety Field Specialist implements the RMPr while the railcar(s) is parked on the Facility rail spur, at the time of transfer, when the transfer process is complete, and prior to releasing the railcar back to the owner.",

The Risk Management Program includes an Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation. Equipment included under this covered process includes (1) three 30,000-gallon stationary storage tanks and ancillary pumps, piping, and valves, (2) 16 1,450-gallon nurse tanks, (3) 36 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, (4) two 1,450-gallon double set nurse tanks, and (5) two 1,000-gallon double set nurse tanks. Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the nurse tanks in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the RMPr.\n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 9,000-gallon commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation. At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and RMPr for review upon request by the Vendor.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Casey Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Casey Facility located on the west end of Casey at 601 West Main Street, Casey, IL 62420.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Casey Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Casey Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Helena acquired this Facility and submitted this 5-Year update to reflect the new ownership.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 RMP Facility were reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).\n\n\n\nIn 2015, the Emergency contact and RMP Implementation Manager changed.  In addition to this change, the ammonia emission rate and quantity released for the railcar alternative consequence analysis was corrected to reflect the actual 2012 modeling.  This current update is being submitted to reflect the current contact and the correction to the OCA data for the railcar alternati"

      "SummaryText": "ve case analysis.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Casey Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates two (2) covered processes that include Railcar Storage and Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,000 gallon) and then transferred to one of three (3) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tanks.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the on-site stationary storage tanks and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates (1) 16 1,450-gallon nurse tanks, (2) 36 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, (3) two 1,450-gallon double set nurse tanks, and (4) two 1,000-gallon double set nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for two covered processes that are conducted at this Facility.  The two covered processes include anhydrous ammonia Railcar Storage and Storage and Handling.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility was the same for both covered processes and assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 34,000-gallon railcar that is delivered in the winter months.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was different for each covered process.  The alternative scenario for the Railcar Storage assumes a 60-minute release from a Railcar valve that was not completely closed.  The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a "

      "SummaryText": "3-minute release from a ruptured 3-inch transfer line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Regulatory & Safety Field Specialist implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Regulatory & Safety Field Specialist is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Regulatory & Safety Field Specialist is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Casey Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Casey Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Casey Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Casey Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Cumberland County LEPC and Casey Fire Department.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Casey Facili"
