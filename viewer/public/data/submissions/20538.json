The same properties that makes valuable fuel also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautioins in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. Propane is utilized in the heat treating processes for chain components to improve durability and resistance to wear for finished roller chan products. In order to move products and materials, liquid propane is dispenced into cylinders for use as a fuel on company forklifts. It is the Company's policy to conduct all its business in compliance with all applicable national, state and local laws, rules and regulations. To promote this policy, the Company has established compliance programs and other policies and procedures to prevent, detect and correct noncompliance with laws, especially criminal laws, and to educate and train employees about legal compliance issues. The Company's internal audit department, with oversight by the law department, perform audits for compliance with all programs. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle propane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. Our emergency response program is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Safety Handbook, \"Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures\" and \"How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\" The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potential affected neighbors. Our propane facility is checked weekly by maintenance personnel. The weekly inspection will record the level in each tank and pressure, visual inspection of the distribution equipment, and the perimeter grounds of the facility. Each year during the week "

      "SummaryText": "of shutdown in August, the burners, burner caps and service controls on all three vaporizers are inspected and tested. All portions of each unit is inspected, cleaned and test fired. The transfer hose utilized to transfer liquid propane from one tank to another is replaced each year and the dust cap is on when not in use. The tanks are also painted and the saddle pads are caulked where the tanks rest. All unused tank fittings are plugged or capped. Pressue relief valves have protective caps or closures to prevent entry of foreign material. The relief valves are replaced when the tanks are emptied due to needed service and/or improvements in process controls. The remote shutoff controls are installed in an accessible area away form the transfer area. The loading or unloading station is protected from pull away damage by a break-away-stanchion. All piping valves and controls are tagged \"normally open\" or \"normally closed\" in accordance with operating procedures. All process controls are year 2000 compliant.  Both the worst-case release and alternative case release scenarios have an offsite impact, which was determined through the use of the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations. Weekly maintenance inspections and operating procedures prevent overfilling of the tanks. Each tank will only be filled to 88% capacity. Three tanks store all of our propane. The largest tank is 30,000 gallons, which is limited to 26,400 gallons storage. The other two tanks, which are 6,000 gallons each, are limited to 5,280 gallons storage for each tank. The worst-case release scenario assumes a release from from our largest vessal that vaporizes resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The worst-case analysis does not consider any passive mitigation systems. The amount of propane released equals 110,880 pounds. The distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint is 0.40 miles as provided in the above referenced guide. For the alternative case release scenario, the incident that was chose"

This scenario was taken directly form the Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities. In this case, the analysis considers the failure of a 25 foot length of unloading hose, 4\" in diameter. The active mitigation devices are assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. The amount of propane released equals 68.59 pounds.
