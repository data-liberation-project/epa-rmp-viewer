The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\n\n\nCymer is a custom chemical manufacturing facility; we handle dimethyamine in the production of some of our products. The same properties of dimethyamine makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling dimethyamine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle dimethyamine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the storage facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled. \n\n\n\nThe primary activity associated with dimethyamine is the manufacture of \"urea\" base curing agents.  Dimethyamine is used in the production of curing agents and several other compounds for a variety of applications. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. The regulated substance handled at this facility is dimethyamine. The maximum amount of dimethyamine that can be stored at this plant is 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario is the rupture and release of the total maximum contents of the storage vessel limited to 40,000 pounds by administrative controls.\n\n\n\nChemical: Dimethylamine [Methanamine, N-methyl-]\n\nModel Used: OCA guidance reference tables and RMP*Comp\n\nCAS number:  124-40-3 Threat type: Flammable Gas\n\nScenario type: Worst-case\n\nQuantity released:  40000 pounds\n\nRelease type:  Vapor Cloud Explosion\n\n Estimated di"

Step-by-step operational and emergency procedures are provided and reviewed. Coordination with the LEPC and EMS is made before each loading operation and notification of transfer operations. Cymer is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule and the EPA RMP rule. The storage system and fire protection system are designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58.
