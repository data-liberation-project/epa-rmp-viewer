The CFF facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented CFF's HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees', the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response plan includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response plan,  CFF emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the  HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, CFF has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as an  evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the CFF HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the CFF facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Macon Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n2.0\tProcess Description and Regulated Substances\n\nCFF is a producer of prepared frozen food products, specifically chicken products and dessert pies.  The NAICS code for these processes at this facility are 311613.   The facility is capable"

      "SummaryText": "of producing and packaging various chicken products including chicken nuggets and frozen meals for consumer intake but the plant is not equipped to slaughter chicken.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products. \n\nCFF has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe  ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 80,000 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to the Con Agra Frozen Foods (CFF) plant in Macon, Missouri.\n\n\n3.0\tWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other release scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario be reported for each regulated chemical.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia"

      "SummaryText": "Below is a description of the release scenarios for ammonia and their off-site consequences:\n\n Worst-case scenario - The largest potential release of ammonia would occur with a puncture in  the receiver located outside on the west side of the plant (part of the west side ammonia system).  The total amount that can be released during the worst-case release is 12,536 pounds.\n\nUnder Section 68.25(c)(1), a regulated toxic substance such as ammonia that is normally a gas at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure shall be considered to be released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  Thus,  ammonia's physical state in the worst-case scenario is a gas.\n\nThe release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - This is the scenario most likely to occur.  In CFF's case the alternative scenario would be caused by the failure/blowing of a relief valve.  The release rate of ammonia due to the relief valve failure is calculated to be 118 lbs/min.\n\nThe release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n\n4.0\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCon Agra Frozen Foods (CFF) has developed an OSHA PSM  program for  their  ammonia refrigeration system.  All of the OSHA PSM documents are located at the plant in Macon.  At CFF, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, CFF's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\n\n1.\tThe ammonia PSM program at CFF includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for  working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews and managing change within the system. The different sections of the PSM document detail employee participation (h"

The plant, therefore, maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n2.\tCFF has researched information pertaining to the properties and hazards of ammonia, sought professional assistance from experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, and used many internal resources to develop the \"ConAgra Frozen Foods - Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Manual\".  Block flow diagrams and P&ID's have been developed and are updated as the ammonia refrigeration system audits are completed.\n\n3.\tCFF has established a hazards analysis team (comprising of plant employees)  responsible for updating existing operating procedures for the refrigeration system and also verifying and documenting the mechanical integrity of the system.\n\n4.\tIn the event of a catastrophic release or an incident which could have resulted in a catastrophe, investigations will be undertaken (this is a policy of the  PSM document).  Necessary preventative measures will be taken to reduce the risk of incident reoccurrence.\n\n\n5.0\tFive-year Accident History\n\nThe review of CFF's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1994 - June 21, 1999.  To date, there have been no reportable accidents with ammonia at the facility.  \n\n\n6.0\tEmergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned previously, the CFF facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called HAZWOPER (document located at the plant in Macon).  The sections of the HAZWOPER document contain detailed procedures for pre-emergency planning and coordination, personnel roles and lines of authority, training, communication, emergency recognition and prevention, safe distances and places of refuge, si"

All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Macon Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.   The Macon Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n\n7.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items were developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished.  For example, in the ammonia system, a leak from condenser fittings, piping, valves or other instrumentation is a potential ammonia release scenario.  The subsequent action item was a recommendation to replace all malleable fittings in the system with ANSI approved fittings.  The  recommendation was followed and the fittings were replaced with ANSI approved fittings."
