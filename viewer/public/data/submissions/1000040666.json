The City of Richland RMP program applies to processes involving the use of chlorine.  The City uses chlorine in amounts greater than the 2,500 pound threshold at its Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  These processes are also subject to coverage by OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), which was implemented in 1997.  The RMP for the CityA\u00bfs covered processes shall be designated as Program 3, the most stringent level of coverage.\r\n \r\nThe wastewater treatment plant uses chlorine primarily for disinfection, but can also use chlorine for odor control purposes.  The WWTP operates year-round.  Fencing and plant personnel control access to the WWTP during regular business hours.  The facility is operated 24 hours per day. The Chlorine is delivered to the facilities via flatbed trucks in 1-ton containers. The containers are offloaded with overhead trolley cranes located in the buildings used specifically for the receipt, storage and distribution of unopened cylinders and containers. The chlorinator units control the gaseous chlorine flow pulled through the vacuum regulator valves by the chlorine injectors located on the downstream piping points.  The maximum chlorine inventory of the facility would be 12 containers at 1-ton each or 24,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine gas from the wastewater treatment plant during the last five years.  Any small leaks that may have occurred during chlorine cylinder changes were orders of magnitude below the threshold limit quantities specified in the regulations for reportable incidents under this program.\r\nBased on the designation of Program 3 requirements, a comprehensive accident prevention program must be developed and implemented.  Many of the elements required by"

      "SummaryText": "this prevention program are analogous to similar required elements under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented by the City of Richland (City) in 1998.\r\n\r\nThe method chosen for the PHA of the chlorination systems is that of a A\u00bfWhat IfA\u00bf analysis. This method was chosen based on the simplicity of the chlorination processes used in the wastewater treatment plant. The chlorination systems are operated under vacuum.  The potential for uncontrolled release from the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is small. \r\n\r\nThe City has developed and implemented standard operating instructions (SOIs) for the operation of equipment and containers used in the chlorination processes. These SOIs encompass loading and unloading the containers from flatbed trucks into the chlorine storage rooms, changing containers and operating the chlorinators.  A troubleshooting matrix for problems with the process and equipment were also developed based on the manufacturerA\u00bfs and US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recommendations.  \r\n\r\nUpon being hired, new operators assigned to the WWTP shall receive extensive hands-on and on the job training by senior operators and supervisors, with occasional classroom instruction.  Operations and maintenance personnel involved with the chlorination system also receive refresher training on chlorine at least every three years.\r\n\r\nThe City of Richland (City) has jurisdiction for operational emergency situations within City limits.  The Benton County Emergency Management division provides support during an emergency in coordination with the City and local emergency response agencies through the Benton County Emergency Operations Center.  These agencies will provide direction to all required public services to provide coordination of traffic control on road, railways, and waterways; HAZMAT team and fire department response; emergency medical services; and notification of the public."
