      "SummaryText": "PB Leiner USA is a manufacturer of gelatin and specialized protein located in Davenport, Iowa.  A single raw material, pig skin, is used in the process of gelatin and protein manufacturing.  This facility handles ammonia which is considered toxic by the US environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  This facility was owned by Hormel from 1978 until 1998, Leiner Davis Gelatin from 1998 until 2003 when it was purchased by the Tessenderlo Group.\n\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain a safe storage and processing of food products, and for humidity control.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the raw materials and products being handled.  The main supply of ammonia is stored in steel tanks located at various areas within the facility.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility.\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nIt is the intent of this facility to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \nThe plant ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using various methods such as on the job training and contractor explanation and training (refrigeration contractors are members of IIAR).

Employees are initially trained and have refresher training in the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system and have received refresher training at least every three years.  \nThe ammonia refrigeration system is mainly operated by compressor microprocessors.  An ammonia detection system within the compressor room is in place which alarms if ammonia is sensed.  The ammonia refrigeration system is also protected by specific safety systems/hardware and safety cutouts including pressure, temperature and level control.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge and vessels from the hazards associated with overpressure.  \n\nAccidental release prevention program:  \n\nAll elements of the PSM/RMP are followed and the process has numerous safe guards including:  \n\u00bf\tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\u00bf\tIn areas where forklifts are utilized, all ammonia lines are elevated to   eliminate any contact.    \n\u00bf\tThe plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n\u00bf\tA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted in 2021.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed: (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents (none reportable); (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\u00bf\tWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia r"

The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\u00bf\tFor plant projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\u00bf\tContractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\u00bf\tThe plant has a program for replacement of all pressure relief valves every five years.\n\nEmergency response program:  \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Davenport Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response.  Representatives of the Davenport Fire Department visited this plant on an annual basis.  \nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to minimize any ammonia release.  These trained staff are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \nFive year accident history: \nWe have had one reportable accidents in the past 5 years related to the ammonia system.  The event was on February 8, 2022, in which a pressure relief valve emitted 197 lbs. of ammonia.  The facility is dedicated to continuous improvement of all systems, specifically those that ca"

In addition to the plant programs mentioned above, the following changes are planned: Upgrade machinery room ventilation alignment, improve ammonia detection control over machinery room ventilation,  installation of emergency generator for operation of engine room emergency ventilation fans, decommissioning of unused ammonia equipment, study the combination of both engine rooms - resulting in the movement of the North engine room, and improving the PHA structure by incorporating more detailed analysis."
