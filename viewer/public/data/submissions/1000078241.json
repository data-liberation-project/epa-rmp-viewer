Glenn Research Center (GRC) at Plum Brook Station (PBS).  The NASA GRC PBS conducts environmental testing of hardware and systems that are intended for space applications for NASA, the Department of Defense (DOD), and commercial aerospace industry.  This testing involves the storage and use of aerospace fluids, including hydrogen.  To meet future aerospace test requirements, NASA GRC PBS anticipates storage and use of hydrogen in amounts above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 lb.  At this time the worst-case analysis release modeling shows there are no public or environmental receptors impacted.  There have been no accidents pertaining to hydrogen at NASA GRC PBS in the past five years. \n\n\n\nA.     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe NASA GRC PBS is committed to providing a safe place of employment by meeting or exceeding applicable health and safety requirements to assure personnel, community, environmental safety, and preservation of resources.  NASA GRC PBS has a history of conducting hazardous testing with liquid rocket propellants.  Designing, building, operating, and maintaining safe, reliable systems is the key to preventing accidental releases. \n\n\n\nThe NASA GRC management system processes and procedures include key safety controls to properly contain and maintain the hazardous substances used and stored at PBS  The primary controls are engineering controls focused on the safe design, build up, and operation of systems. \n\n\n\nThe NASA GRC achievement of ISO9001/AS9100 certification assures implementation of the Quality Management System (QMS) at the facility.  The QMS establishes a policy to provide accountability and ensure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and N"

The NASA GRC Emergency Management Plan provides directions for activities that eliminate or reduce the probability of disaster; prepare measures which protect life, the environment, and property; respond appropriately during emergencies; and establish a recovery system returning the facility to normal or improved operation following an emergency. \n\n\n\nThe NASA GRC PBS efforts to prevent accidental release involves a review of lessons learned from the previous incidents within the Agency.  This includes a survey of hydrogen-related incidents in the NASA Mishap Information System (NMIS) and the NASA Lessons Learned Database.\n\n\n\nB.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nHazardous chemicals are essential in testing space systems at NASA GRC PBS.  The EPA regulates one of these chemicals that NASA GRC PBS possesses in an amount over the threshold quantity, hydrogen. This propellant is used in NASA, DOD, and commercial space systems.  The hydrogen is used for engine testing and to evaluate long term in-space storage and handling technologies and applications.  \n\n\n\nAt NASA GRC PBS, liquid hydrogen is stored in a 33,000-gallon storage dewar with a maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) of 75 psig.

NASA GRC PBS follows the EMP which enables the emergency management activities to work effectively within the protocol of the National Response Framework (NRF) and the National Incident Management System (NIMS).  \n\n\n\nb.    PBS Chemical-Prevention Steps\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) covered hydrogen process is also reviewed through the Pressure Systems Office to coordinate on fluid/material evaluations and component and system level analyses.  System configurations, review documentation, procedures, and maintenance records are controlled by a quality management system.

The Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe RMP as required by 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68.190 of the rule, must contain an updated Five-Year Accident History which involves the reporting of significant accidental releases of RMP regulated substances from an RMP covered process in the five years prior to the submission of an initial or updated Risk Management Plan.  The Five-Year Accident History only pertains to releases from a covered process and involving a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.  The release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (40 CFR 68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (40 CFR 68.42(a)).\n\n\n\nThe EPA identifies in EPA 555-B-04-001, General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention that if there has been a release of a regulated substance from a process where the regulated substance is held below its threshold quantity, then a facility does not need to report that release even if the release caused one of the listed impacts.

This Plan provides direction to mitigate the effects of hazards, preserving life and minimizing damage to PBS operations and infrastructure.  This Plan directs response during emergencies, and establishes a recovery system in order to return the facility to normal operations after a major incident, such as a natural disaster or a technological accident.\n\n\n\nThe EMP establishes an Emergency Management Coordinator (EMC), who is responsible for managing the EMP and has the authority to implement EMP response, recovery, preparedness, and mitigation activities at NASA GRC PBS.  The NASA GRC PBS utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) in the handling of emergencies and maintains Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with local first responders as needed.  For more complex emergencies, the NASA GRC Incident Command will form a unified command with the local community emergency response entity.\n\n\n\nFire, medical, and chemical spills that exceed NASA GRC PBS local area capabilities to handle safely are examples of emergencies that will be handled using the ICS.  Emergencies of all types will be dealt with at the lowest level that is practical and safe.  When an incident is elevated to an emergency classification, there is a clear transition of authority to an Incident Commander once they arrive on the scene, and the local person in charge functions as the technical advisor.
