      "SummaryText": "Wayne Farms-Dobson is a poultry processing facility that stores and uses a chemical that is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  This chemical is Ammonia for refrigeration.  We currently have maximum storage capacity of 12,700 pounds of Ammonia at the Dobson facility.\n\nWayne Farms-Dobson believes that the ammonia we store and handle on site has very real and potential danger.   However, it is important to keep the risks in perspective.  Wayne Farms-Dobson's ammonia storage and handling facilities:\n1.  are properly designed\n2.  have effective operation and maintenance procedures\n3.  employ trained operators and tecchnicians\n4.  periodically conduct safety audits, and\n5.  are constantly upgrading its processes to meet or exceed industry standards\n\nWayne Farms-Dobson also has taken a proactive approach towards coordinating emergency efforts with the Dobson Fire Department.  The Surry County E.M.A. has a copy of our emergency response program and is well trained and prepared to respond to the potential spills and leaks that may occur at the Wayne Farms-Dobson facility.  The Fire Department conducts annual site visits to our facility and is prepared to respond to a possible spill or leak.\n\nA facility which maintains high standards, such as Wayne Farms-Dobson, provides less public risk than a facility that does not provide safe operations.  Wayne Farms-Dobson complies with Federal OSHA rules and guidelines for safe handling, storage and operation of ammonia systems.  We also utilize outside ammonia system experts to periodically inspect our systems integrity, train system operatorsand upgrade system to imporve safety.  As a result of Wayne Farms-Dobson's safety program, Wayne Farms-Dobson has had no releases of ammonia which resulted in any off site injury or illiness in the past five years.\n\nBecause of the large quantities of ammonia Wayne Farms-Dobson maintains on site, there is a very small probability that there could be off-site consequences if a major leak o"

      "SummaryText": "ccurred.  Wayne Farms-Dobson used EPA's OCA Guidance for off-site consequence analysis of ammonia.\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (12,700 pounds in 10 minutes), a .7 mile radius around the Dobson facility may have to be notified and possibly evacuated.  According to 1990 Census Data, 185 people in the surrounding community should be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.\n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nDuring the past five years Wayne Farms-Dobson has had several small releases of ammonia to the atmosphere.  A 1,000 pound release was used to determine an alternatiave-release scenario, which would result in a release of ammonia that would only travel .1 mile and may, according to 1990 Census Data, require 8 people in the surrounding community to be evacuated.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWayne Farms-Poultry Divison believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform the public of the potential dangers and the actions that Wayne Farms has taken to minimize these dangers.  Wayne Farms-Dobson (one of the larger employers in Surry County) has a long-great ongoing relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Surry County."
