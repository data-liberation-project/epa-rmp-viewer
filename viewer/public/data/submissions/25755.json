If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Adair County LEPC, and/or any other authorities to mitigate and mimimize the impacts of the release to the people and the enviroment.\n\nFacility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for the direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quanity stored would be 275,700 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\nWorse-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe worse case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 113,800 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.\n\nThe alternate release scenario, a transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve(s) intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quanity released would be 14,900 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe faciity is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\", published by the American National Institute, (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling o"
