In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\n\nThe Exxon U.S.A. Grand Isle Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency response organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this RMPlan.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Exxon U.S.A. Grand Isle Gas Plant, located on LA Highway 1, on Grand Isle in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, consists of one Program Level 3 process which utilizes several operations (e.g., separat"

The Plant could contain up to 370,000 pounds of regulated flammables (e.g., mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane, and iso-pentane), but no regulated toxic inventories in excess of the threshold quantities established in the regulation.  All transportation of regulated flammables into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines.  Open land and waterways, other industry, and seasonal residences surround the Plant.  The Title V permit for this facility has been submitted and approval is pending.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS) \nThe WCS, as defined in the regulation, is a release of flammable materials (i.e., mixture of natural gas liquids) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  This scenario is extremely remote, but is required by the EPA regulation.  Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is significantly less than the maximum capacity and this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release.  No mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The WCS could potentially have some off-site impacts, but the impact area includes few public receptors.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) \nThe ARS is a release of flammable materials (i.e., mixture of natural gas liquids) due to a hole in the vessel resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  Even though this event is unlikely (i.e., process is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel), the normal operating inventor"

For specific process areas, the Plant has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level) in the operating procedures.  The Plant ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\nThe Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Plant primarily uses the What If/Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  This technique is recognized by OSHA as an acceptable hazard evaluation technique for PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Plant operating/maintenance personnel and facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.

The ARS could potentially have some off-site impacts, but the impact area includes few public receptors and no environmental receptors.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Plant.  Because processes at the Plant regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to (and in compliance with) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the Plant and addresses each program element.  In addition, the Plant has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nThe Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

Implementation of the resolutions is based on relative risk.  Potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk are addressed first.  All resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design, the Plant updates and revalidates the process hazard analysis at least every 5 years.  The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Plant maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations (e.g., startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, cold startup) and provide guidance on how to respond to upper/lower limit exceedances for specific equipment or process parameters.  Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and certified as current/accurate.  Procedures are maintained current/accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written operating procedures, the Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating process equipment.  New employees receive basic training in Plant operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators (i.e., subject matter experts) to learn process-specific duties and tasks."
