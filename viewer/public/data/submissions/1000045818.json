      "SummaryText": "SOURCE \r\nThe Rust-Oleum Corporation (Rust-Oleum) off-site warehouse located in Martinsburg, West Virginia, is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (USEPAs) Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it contains a mixture of propane (Chemical Abstract System [CAS] number 74-98-6) and n-butane (CAS number 106-97-8) exceeding 10,000 pounds. The mixture is used as a propellant for aerosol paint cans.\r\n \r\nFinished goods are transferred to the warehouse for interim storage. Mixtures of propellant, flammable liquids, and paint solids are stored in approximately 16-ounce cans. Approximately 440,000 pounds of propellant may be stored in the Martinsburg Distribution Center (DC) warehouse, located at 891 Auto Parts Place in Martinsburg, West Virginia.\r\n \r\nPropellant is a flammable and potentially explosive gas. The propellant is not inherently toxic.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario is based upon an entire pallet of aerosol cans being considered a single vessel. The maximum pallet  contains 274 individual aerosol cans averaging 1 pound each. The RMP regulated chemicals are propane and n-butane and the maximum quantity of this mixture (being used as a propellant) per aerosol can is 2.27 ounces. In calculating the worst case release scenario, the entire contents of the aerosol can (i.e., 16 ounces) was considered flammable, since many of the chemicals contained within the product (i.e., paint) are also viewed as flammable. The mixture of the flammable ingredients varies dependent upon the product contents. Thus, for purposes of determining the worst case release scenario, the heat of combustion value calculated for the propellant mixture is also used for the remaining flammable portion of the product contents (i.e., paint) within the container. \r\n\r\nPer the RMP Rule, the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance consists of a vapor cloud explosion and the endpoint for this scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario is an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi). The total quantity of the flammable substance is assumed to form a vapor cloud. The entire contents of the cloud are assumed to be within the flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to explode. For the worst-case, analysis, in accordance with 40 CFR 68.25(e), 10 percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion and the rate of release is not considered in the equation. Rather, the quantity of the flammable mixture and the entire contents of the container are assumed to be released instantaneously.\r\n\r\nConsequence distances to an overpressure level of 1 pound per square inch (psi) are determined using equation C-2 provided in Appendix C of the OCAG guidance document; dated April 15, 1999. This equation is developed based upon the TNT-Equivalency Method. No administrative controls or passive mitigation systems were considered in this scenario.  The heat of combustion values were obtained from Exhibit C-1 of Appendix C of the OCAG guidance document. The following values were used in the calculations: 45,719 kjoule/kg for butane and 46,333 kjoule/kg for propane.\r\n\r\nBecause the site qualifies for RMP Program 1 requirements, an alternative release scenario was not assessed.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE IMPACT\r\n\r\nThe endpoint distance from the worst-case release scenario, 0.05 miles (275 feet), does not extend beyond the property line of the Martinsburg Distribution Center facility.  Therefore, no public or environmental receptors are impacted.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of the covered flammable substances at the Rust-Oleum, Martinsburg, West Virginia distribution center in the last 5 years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site; or off-site death, injury, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nAlthough a formal, documented prevention program is not required by"

      "SummaryText": "the RMP rule for Program 1 processes, a number of design and operational controls are in place to decrease the severity or prevent the occurrence of a fire or explosion. The most significant controls are described below:\r\n \r\nThe warehouse is designed as an aerosol warehouse in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products code (NFPA 30B).\r\n \r\nAerosol storage is limited to a maximum height of 15 feet\r\n\r\nA minimum of 8 feet is maintained between pallet rows.\r\n \r\nThe pallets of aerosol cans are stored separate from other flammable liquids and separated by a minimum of 2 hour rated construction.\r\n\r\nA fire spinkler system designed for 0.53 gpm per square foot is installed in the storage area.\r\n \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN \r\n\r\nAn emergency response plan is maintained at the Martinsburg Distribution Center facility and reviewed annually to identify potential plan updates recommended to improve site safety.  No accidental releases of regulated flammable substances have occurred at the Martinsburg Distribution Center facility in the last 5 years.  Coordination of emergency response activities is facilitated by the site's inclusion in the Berkeley County's Office of Emergency Management offsite response plan and by compliance with the annual chemical inventory filing requirements of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act program."
