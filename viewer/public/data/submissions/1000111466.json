      "SummaryText": "The Grand Forks Regional Water Treatment Plant (RWTP) is located at 955 South 58th Street.  The Plant currently used chlorine to disinfect the drinking water for the city.  At any point in time the city keeps an inventory of no more than 9 one-ton cylinders or 18000 pounds of this product on site.  Product arrives at the plant along designated truck routes to minimize risk to the public.  All chlorine cylinders are stored in a clearly labeled and confined area of the treatment plant.  The plant has a vacuum operated feed system which minimizes discharges within the facility.  The chlorine cylinder valves are also equipped with automatic shutoffs.\nThe Risk Management Plan bein submitted by the City of Grand Forks is a composite of:\n1.  Definition of a worse case hazard assessment involving the accidental release of contents of a one ton cylinder of chlorine during the unloading process.  A release of this nature would release hazardous material into a residential and Industrial neighborhood.  The Water Treatment plant has worked with the Fire Department in developing a scenario involving the evacuation of residents and Water Plant employees.  The plant operator will initiate a response by the fire department by calling 911.  \n2.  An alternate release scenario where chlorine is released within the chlorine storage area was assessed.  In this case we are relying on our automatic shutoffs to shut down all the chlorine tanks.  In all likelihood  this scenario would be confined to the chlorine room.  The Fire Department for the City maintains the chlorine leak repair kit as part of their Haz-Mat response equipment.\n3.  The RWTP has taken many preventive measures to minimize risks.  The chlorine storage area is separated from the plant.  Access is limited to outside entrances with security card access only.  The doors are also equipped with emergency bar exits.  The RWTP also maintains a stand-by-generator that is capable of operating all in plant processes.\n4.  The RWTP o"

      "SummaryText": "perations staff are working to update a computerized preventive maintenance program to schedule maintenance on all feed equipment, unloading equipment, automatic shutoffs, air handling and related building systems.  Inspections are done daily, monthly, quarterly and annually.\n5.  The Water Department works closely with the Fire Department and Emergency Operations Center. Sara Title III reports are filed annually keeping them informed of the materials stored at the RWTP.  The Fire Department maintains a Haz-Mat team that responds to chemical hazards at the RWTP and through the community.  They maintain SCBA equipment, haz-mat suits and chlorine leak repair kit.\n6.  Administration of the RMP will be the responsibility of the Water Treatment Plant Supervisor.  The Supervisor will serve as a liaison to the Water Treatment Plant Manager, Mayor's office, Fire Department and The LEPC.  Training and preparedness exercises will be coordinated with these local agencies."
