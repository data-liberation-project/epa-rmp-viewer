The refining process is very complex and involves the use of flammable materials and various chemicals. Silver Eagle takes every precaution to ensure that flammable materials and chemicals are handled and stored safely and in accordance with industry standards. Employees are trained so that they can safely do their jobs and protect human health and the environment.\n\nOne of the main products produced at the refinery is gasoline. Gasoline must meet seasonal specification in order to be marketed. One of the specifications is Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP). The vapor pressure of the gasoline is crucial to proper ignition. Butane can be utilized to make gasoline meet the required RVP specifications. Butane also enhances the gasoline octane characteristics. \n\nSilver Eagle has installed equipment to unload butane railcars and trucks into its gasoline blending system. The butane unloading system has been installed to meet National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and American Petroleum Institute (API) standards. This system includes emergency shut off valves, check valves to prevent back flow and excess flow valves that shut off automatically in case of an unloading hose failure. Unloading procedures have been developed to meet Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements. Refinery personnel are routinely trained about unloading procedures.\n\nIn conjunction with the butane unloading system, Silver Eagle has prepared a Risk Management Plan in accordance with federal regulations (40 CFR Part 68). The RMP was developed Using RMP-Submit, a program developed by EPA's Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO). Several \"worst case\" scenarios involving butane were included in preparing the RMP. The worst case scenarios and planning distances were developed with the use o"

The worst case scenario at the Silver Eagle refinery was determined to be the complete rupture of a butane railcar and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion. In this case, structures within approximately 2,100 ft (.4 miles) of the railcar unloading could be affected. The alternate \"worst case\" scenario was determined to be a butane railcar BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion). For this case structures within approximately 2,000 ft (.38 miles) of the railcar facility could be affected.\n\nSilver Eagle has not experienced any releases of butane at its Woods Cross facility. To minimize the possibility of a worst-case incident Silver Eagle has installed the unloading system as described above. The refinery has also upgraded its fire water supply line and installed firewater turrets capable of covering the entire unloading area. In addition, operating employees receive emergency response training and training on butane unloading procedures.\n\nThe butane unloading system has been inspected by the South Davis County Fire Marshall.
