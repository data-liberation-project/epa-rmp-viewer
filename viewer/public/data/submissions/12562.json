This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n \n  South Bishop Plant operates a cryogenic natural gas liquids extraction process consisting of dehydration, cooling by heat exchanger cooled by a propane compressor unit, and residue gas compression.  The plant is unmanned, however operators and maintenance personnel visit the site on a daily basis.\n\n  The plant is located in Ellis County, Oklahoma.  It can be reached by traveling 6 miles west of Arnett, Oklahoma on highway 60 to the intersection of highway 283, then south, following the pavement for 14 miles.  The pavement will curve to the west before arriving at the location.\n \nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n \n  The worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in a Program Level 2 process at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing natural gas liquids whose constituent base includes several regulated substances. A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 121,000 lbs. (90% of the maximum tank level).  The reduced inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 mile. Although controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage its consequences, no credit for passive"

The discharge through a one inch hole would last for 1.65 minutes releasing 661 lbs of methane,  and producing a VCE with a 1-psi endpoint of 0.07 miles.  There are no receptors within this radius.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n \n   The process at South Bishop plant is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP).  Following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. \n \nEmployee Participation   \n \n  Williams encourages employees working at South Bishop Plant to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating procedures and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant Risk Management program.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address risk management and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both facility and personnel safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of expertise, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n \nProcess Safety Information\n \n  South Bishop Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any ne"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Operating Procedures. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n  The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \n Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \n  South Bishop Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n                                                                \n  South Bishop Plant primarily uses the HAZOP method for identifying hazards.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n \n  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \nOperating Procedures\n \n  South Bishop Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n Training\n \n  To complement the written procedures for process operations, South Bishop Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n \n  South Bishop Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of re"

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n \nMechanical Integrity\n\n   South Bishop Plant has procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n   \n  Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n \n  Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  South Bishop Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n \nSafe Work Practices"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n \nManagement of Change \n\n  Although not required for a program 2 facility, South Bishop Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n \n Incident Investigation\n \n  South Bishop Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The inves"
