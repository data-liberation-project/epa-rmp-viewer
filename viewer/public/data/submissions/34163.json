Written procedures are maintained and are followed by Institute personnel.  Release-reporting procedures are contained in Institute\u00bfs manufacturing process units which prescribe immediate and follow-up reporting to federal, state, and local authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the U.S. Coast Guard, the West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection (WVDEP), the state and local emergency planning centers (EPC\u00bfs), local fire and police departments, water departments, local residents, schools, hospitals and other interested parties.  The plant maintains an emergency response team with appropriate training and equipment to respond to releases of toxic or flammable materials inside the plant.  The plant also has mutual-aid agreements with local fire departments for response to various emergencies including chemical releases.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Institute Plant is located eight miles west of Charleston, WV on the north bank of the Kanawha River.  The site has a total area of 460 acres, which is owned by Bayer CropScience.  Portions of the site are leased to Union Carbide (Dow), Praxair, and Reagent Chemical Company.\n\nBayer CropScience operates two business entities at the site.  They are Bayer CropScience (agricultural chemicals) and Adisseo Animal Nutrition (RHODIMET AT-88).  Bayer CropScience also provides personnel to operate and maintain the Dow chemical facilities.  Praxair and Reagent Chemical operate their own facilities inside the site.\n\nBayer CropScience has five production processes at this site that are covered by the RMP rule.  Four of those processes, Methyl Isocyanate, Phosgene/Chlorine, Methomyl, and Aldicarb support the Bay"

      "SummaryText": "orated into the design and operation of the unit process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals are evaluated and strengthened as needed to assure their effectiveness at each level.  Ultimately, the major objective of process safety management of hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals which could expose our employees and others to serious hazards.\n\nIn regard to specific chemicals and processes regulated under RMP, the processes subject to the RMP regulation are also subject to OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulation.  OSHA's PSM regulation is intended to prevent potential releases inside the plant and the RMP program is meant to help control or prevent releases which may affect off-site human health or the environment.\n\nAccidental releases from these processes are prevented by studying the hazards of the processes to identify potential hazards and implementing procedures, installing control devices and systems, and providing training to control those hazards.  The processes are periodically evaluated to assess the risk of the operations by current standards and to make improvements where necessary.  For methyl isocyanate and phosgene in particular, on-site inventories have been minimized as far as practicable in order to minimize the potential impact in the event of a release.  In 1992 and 1993, the Phosgene process was rebuilt and the MIC process was modified to achieve these improvements following a thorough study of potential release scenarios.\n\nIn addition to skilled operators, all of the processes are controlled by computerized control systems which monitor and record conditions within the processes and make adjustments accordingly.  In addition to the control systems, several of the processes are equipped with redundant computer safety systems which act to correct or shutdown the processes if certain parameters are exceeded and other process are equipped with direct shutdown controls to achieve sim"

All of the processes covered by RMP utilize scrubbers and flares to destroy emissions from the process to minimize releases to the atmosphere.  \n\nMaintenance of equipment containing hazardous substances is also a key element in preventing accidental releases.  In addition, any changes made to the processes are carefully reviewed prior to implementation to ensure that safety and environmental risks are recognized and addressed.  Finally, while many steps have been taken to prevent accidental releases, in the event that an accidental release does occur, it investigated to determine the root causes and to prescribe corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring in the future.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Institute Site has had three accidental releases from  RMP-covered processes that meet the RMP reporting criteria during the last five years.  The first incident occurred on October 15, 1999 when a pinhole developed on a Reactor in the Methyl Isocyanate process due to corrosion/erosion.  As a result, approximately 15 pounds of phosgene was released resulting in one on-site exposure and an off-site shelter-in-place.  The second incident occurred on May 22, 2000 when a small amount of chlorine (less than one pound) leaked from a valve inside of the chlorine unloading building leading to an employee exposure.  There were no off-site impacts.  The third incident occurred on August 13, 2001 when an error during maintenance resulted in a spill of liquid chloroform.  Approximately 3000 pounds of the chloroform that was spilled evaporated resulting in multiple exposures on-site.  There were no off-site impacts.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Institute Plant maintains a highly trained emergency response team to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, medical, chemical spills, and natural disasters and rescue emergencies.  It also participates in local fire and industrial mutual aid systems.  The Institute Plant has a dedicated in-plan"

Additionally, a plant-wide notification system is in place in the event of an emergency.  The plant has an on site dispensary and medical professional  as well as full-coverage with Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and paramedics.\n\n\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are many operating and mechanical changes that continuously occur to improve the safe operation of the Bayer CropScience facilities.  These occur as a result of the periodic risk-based process hazard assessment review process, which is described above."

The fifth process, RHODIMET\u00bf, supports the Adisseo Animal Nutrition business, which is operated for Adisseo by Bayer CropScience.\n\nThe Phosgene/Chlorine process receives and converts chlorine into phosgene.  Chloroform is used in the Phosgene process to provide cooling.  The phosgene is then reacted with monomethylamine  in the manufacture of methyl isocyanate in the Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) process.  Chloroform is also used in the MIC process to provide cooling.  The Methomyl process produces a crystalline material that is used as a raw material for the Larvin process and is also sold as a product.  The Methomyl process uses methyl isocyanate, produced by the MIC Unit, and methyl mercaptan as raw materials.  The Aldicarb process produces a crystalline material kept in a liquid solution that is further processed off-site before it is used as an insect control agent.  The Aldicarb process uses methyl isocyanate, produced by the MIC Unit, and trimethylamine as raw materials.  The RHODIMET\u00bf AT-88 facility produces methionine hydroxy analog that is used in poultry feed supplies.  Ammonia is used as a raw material for this process.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nManaging Process Safety at the Institute Site requires proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  We endorse and maintain an effective process safety management program that requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements which impact the process are all considered in the evaluation.
