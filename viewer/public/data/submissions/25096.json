Facility Policy:\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of DEDHAM COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\nThe ptrimary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in one (1) 30,000-gallon and one (1) 18,000-gallon storage tanks. In addition to the permanent storage tanks at this facility, anhydrous ammonia may also be stored in one or more of thirty-six (36) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks. \n\nIn addition L.P. Gas (Propane) is stored on-site at this facility. It is stored in one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank located directly across the road from and on the west side of the corporate office. This information is included in the Executive Summary for reference purposes only.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:\n\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total content of the one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity released would be 131,250 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to end-point, based on EPA's RMP Comp Program is 4.4 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is the release from a break in a transfer hose from an in-bound transport unit to the supply tank. Based upon EPA's RMP Comp Program, the distance to end-poin"
