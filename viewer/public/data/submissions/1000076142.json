This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Culberson Midstream LLC to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Maverick Liquids Fallout Facility is located in Culberson County, Texas is owned by Culberson Midstream LLC and is operated by Culberson Midstream LLC.\n\n\n\nMaverick Liquid Fallout Facility is a site for collecting condensate from raw gas. The inlet stream enters the slug catcher V-1115 at high pressure, roughly 1000 psig. Gas leaves the slug catcher via the offload line where it goes through the offload scrubber V-1120 and then exits the site. Liquids are sent in batches to the 3-phase 60,000 gallon surge vessel V-7010, where a pressure cut is taken between the slug catcher and surge vessel across a liquid control valve, taking the liquids from 1000 psig to about 30 psig. Any flash that occurs in the vessel is captured by overhead compressors C-2310/2315 and pressured to 1000 psig to combine back with the offload line between the slug catcher and offload scrubber. The liquids are sent in batches from the surge vessel to atmospheric tanks. Water is sent to (2) produced water tanks TK-8180/8181 and condensate is sent to (4) condensate tanks TK-8100/8110/8120/8130. The (6) tanks have a common vapor header and any flash is captured by the VRU C-0101, compressed to 35 psig, and sent to the suction of the over"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).\n\n\n\nCulberson Midstream LLC also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nCulberson Midstream LLC primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Culberson Midstream staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility. The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nContractors\n\nThe Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, Placeholder Petrochemical evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Placeholder Petrochemical personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Maverick Liquid Fallout Facility has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.
