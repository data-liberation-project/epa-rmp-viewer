Chlorine is removed as a gas under pressure of the liquid in the individual containers; however the majority of the chlorine feed is operated through a water injection induced vacuum, making the system extremely safe and minimizing potential pressurized leaks along the feed lines.  \r\n   \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Grapevine WTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine equipment utilizing only fully trained personnel in this area.  Grapevine WTP management enforces consistent operation through discipline for operational deviations.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Grapevine WTP\u00bfs accident history was reviewed for a period from June, 1999, through June, 2004.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine had occurred.  In addition, Grapevine WTP accident history was reviewed for a period from June, 2004 through January, 2007. During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine had occurred. Additionally, Grapevine WTP accident history was reviewed for a period from February 2007 through January, 2012.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program involving immediate plant evacuation once the City\u00bfs Fire Department is called to implement response and repair to leaking chlorine gas.  The plant is staffed 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.  Plant operators are required to make rounds for inspection and monitoring of the plant processes at least every two hours.  Accordingly, plant staff will detect any releases of chlorine and the Fire Department is trained to respond to this situation. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the plant evacuation plan, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency responder\u00bfs plan for handling such an emergency. \r\n\r\nThe Grapevine Fire Department ha"

      "SummaryText": "The Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68) is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Risk Management Program rule addresses over 100 chemical substances 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 of which are flammable gases and the accidental release of these substances. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\r\nThe Grapevine Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored is above the threshold limit specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The Grapevine WTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP) Plan that contains the following required information:\r\n\u00bfManagement System\r\n\u00bfA hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B).\r\n\u00bfA prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations. (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C)\r\n\u00bfAn emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E)\r\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the Grapevine WTP.\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Grapevine WTP facility in Grapevine, Texas has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at this f"

There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Grapevine Fire Department in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the Grapevine Fire Department, relaying information regarding the release prior to implementing plant evacuation to a location outside the plant gates, awaiting the arrival of the fire department to inform its personnel of all information about the release and to provide assurance that the plant has been totally evacuated.

The Grapevine WTP regularly has a maximum storage quantity of 12 one ton containers (24,000 pounds) of chlorine at its facility.  This is above the threshold limit (2,500 pounds) set by the USEPA. \r\n\r\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nThe Grapevine WTP receives raw water from Lake Grapevine, which is pumped into the treatment plant located at 2600 Fairway Drive, in Grapevine, Texas.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped to the distribution network of pipelines, pump station, and storage tanks.  \r\nThe existing chlorine feed facility at the Grapevine WTP consists of  (1) up to twelve one ton chlorine containers, (2) a vacuum regulator mounted on an automatic switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves, (3) four flow proportionate feed chlorinators, (4) gas piping and ejectors, and (5) chlorine solution diffusers.  On treatment plant grounds, the only area in which chlorine has a potential to generate a gaseous release is the chlorine storage area (items 1 and 2 above).. \r\nChlorine containers are delivered to the Grapevine WTP by truck and stored in the outside stor"

The most notable planned changes include the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bfThe consideration of remote leak detection for chlorine gas in the area of the outside storage of chlorine cylinders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00bfIn the future when the plant facilities are expanded or upgraded, consideration should be given to design and construction of a containment building to encompass the chlorine cylinders designed in conjunction with the capability to chemically neutralize any accidental releases of chlorine.  This option might be compared with the conversion to a nongaseous chlorine compound."
