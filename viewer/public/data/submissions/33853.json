MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the F.E. Weymouth Water Filtration Plant (WFP).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nThe WFP's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\u00b7 Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\u00b7 Gene"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy for chlorine involves the preparation of integrated contingency plans, which address emergency response for hazardous materials and are tailored to each facility.  These plans integrate with the emergency response services available in the community and are in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  WFP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  This emergency response plan is being  coordinated with local response agencies (Los Angeles County Fire Department).  WFP has an excellent safety record with 50 years of chlorine use.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe MWDSC F.E. Weymouth Filtration Plant is located at 700 North Moreno Avenue, in La Verne, California.

WFP also has procedures in place that are triggered to update process safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1992, 1995, and 1998 detailed process hazard analyses (PHAs) were conducted for the chlorination system equipment and procedures.  The 1998 RMP PHA was further reviewed and updated in January 2004 and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions were developed in January 2004 to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nAn update of the February 1999 CalARP seismic risk assessment was recently completed based on Region 1 LEPC CalARP Seismic Update Guidance, and recommendations were provided to WFP staff for their evaluation and implementation.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWFP maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for the chlorine process.  The WFP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.

WFP training program includes four elements: (1) initial training and awareness training, (2) refresher training, (3) documentation, and (4) and testing.  Each employee presently involved in operating the chlorine process has been trained to receive the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including chlorine emergency response, as provided in the operating procedures.  \n\nRefresher training is provided every three years or less to each employee operating the covered process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  In addition, the WFP ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change as indicated in their Management of Change and/or Pre Startup Safety Review procedures.\n\nWFP prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person (s) admini"

      "SummaryText": "he last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nWFP is a first responder facility (i.e. HAZWOPER trained plant employees respond to chlorine accidental releases).  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Los Angeles County Fire Department will be called to aid in handling a chlorine release.  As part of the emergency response program, the WFP has developed and implemented a Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan (HMHWCP) for the purpose of protecting plant employees, public health and the environment.  The HMHWCP has a special focus on responding to chlorine emergencies.\n\nThe HMHWCP plan is being coordinated with local response agencies (Los Angeles County Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, HAZMAT responder team, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all HAZMAT responders. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1992, 1995 and 1998, when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the facility.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required.  Additional changes to improve chlorine safety were identified in January 2004, when the 1998 RMP process hazard analysis was reviewed and updated.  It is expected that these recommended actions will be evaluated and implemented in a timely fashion.\n\nAs part of this ongoing commitment to chlorine safety, MWDSC is constructing a facility a"

This chlorine containment and neutralization project will markedly reduce the accidental release risk to plant employees, the surrounding community and the environment. The project is close to the end of construction and the facility is expected to be in operation late 2004."
