      "SummaryText": "Stonyfield Farm is a manufacturer of quality yogurt (dairy) products,\nlocated in Londonderry, New Hampshire.  The facility is located in a modern industrial park\nadjacent to the Manchester, New Hampshire airport, and employs approximately 250 persons on\nthree shifts.  Normal operations are five days per week, with infrequent weekend manufacturing\noperations.\n\nThe covered process at this facility is an ammonia-based mechanical refrigeration system which\ncontains a maximum intended inventory of 18,500 pounds. \n\nThe facility has an active Process Safety Management Program.  Operation of the ammonia\nequipment is restricted to only a select few trained, authorized operating/maintenance personnel. \nThe majority of the distribution piping which contains ammonia, and connects to air cooling\nevaporator units and process equipment, is located above the roof of the processing areas, and\ntherefore not very susceptable to damage from accidental, inadvertant contact by lift trucks and\nlifted loads.  Nearly all equipment and associated piping within those spaces is located as high as\npossible within the spaces, to minimize accidents.   The significant investment associated with\nthe pre-planning for safety is an example of the commitment of management to identifying\ncritical safety control points and improving the process accordingly.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, the entire contents of the ammonia refrigeration system would be\nexpelled in 10 minutes:  the release rate would be 1850 pounds per minute, or less.  This might\nresult from the rupture of a 2\" high pressure (180 psig) liquid ammonia pipe, which is an unlikely\nbut nevertheless plausible scenario.  In such a case, the distance to toxic endpoint (200 ppm)\nunder worst-case ambient conditions (still air) is anticipated to be 2.5 miles.  Ammonia is an\nextremely hazardous and toxic chemical, but the toxicity level is substantial:  the offensive,\nchoking odor of ammonia is readily distinguished and familiar to most humans, who gener"

The toxicity concentration is 2400 ppm or above. \nThe more-likely release scenario selected and evaluated, and having the greatest offsite risk, is\nthe accidental rupture of a ?\" low pressure liquid pipe:  in that case, the release rate was found to\nbe 250 pounds per minute, and the vulnerability zone (distance to toxic endpoint) is reduced to\n0.30 miles from the facility.   It is possible (but unlikely) that such a release could be on-going\nfor a period of up to one hour before  intervening action can be taken by trained personnel.  The\nlocation of the facility in the community, together with the topography and consideration for\nprevailiing wind direction, helps to minimize the overall risk to human populations.\n\nAn OSHA-prescribed Process Safety Management Program has been adopted for this facility. \nUnder that Program, the major components of the process are inspected frequently.  Operating\nconditions are constantly monitored by a computerized system with integral alarms that notify\nprocess operators of an upset.  The readily-distinguished odor of ammonia alerts persons in the\nconstantly-inhabited areas where ammonia-containing piping and equipment is located that even\nthe slightest release may have occurred.  As stated above, the company has located principal\npiping and many key shutoff valves on the roof area for easier access in emergency conditions. \nShutoff valves which allow operators to isolate sections of piping/equipment in compressor room\nareas are readily accessed.  The compressor room area is well vented with high volume fans, and\nis readily accessible in case of a release in that area.\n\nAs a testimony to the overall safety of the ammonia refrigeration system operation at this facility,\nand the diligence of the process operators, no accidents have occurred within the past five years\nwhich have necessitated an off-site evacuation or have had any offsite consequences.\n\nThe Londonderry, NH LEPC has incl"

The facility's relationship with the LEPC is expected to include frequent\ninteractive exercises and regular dialogue regarding the process. The Londonderry Fire\nDepartment does not maintain its own HAZMAT squad, but does have a mutual aid agreement in\nplace with nearby municipalities for the provision of those services in the event of an accidental\nrelease which requries external intervention or assistance.   Stonyfield Farm has adopted the\nINTEGRATED CONTINGENCY PLAN format preferred by EPA and OSHA for preparing and\nimplementing its onsite Emergency Action and Response Plan.   Under this plan, emergency\ntraining and practice drills will be frequent and will cover a multitude of potential scenarios. \nThree key managers will become involved immediately upon the recognition and characterization\nof all non-incidental ammonia releases, and their duties will be as follows:  (a) coordination of\nand direction to onsite and external emergency responders; (b) notification of agencies and\non-site safety and security; (c) protection and continuation of business operations and employee\nwelfare; and (d) communication with the public as necessary.\n\nStonyfield Farm will continue to investigate and implement changes to the ammonia process in\norder to improve safety and minimize risks associated with it.  In addition to relocating piping\nand valves, future plans include the increase of automatic ammonia leak detection systems,\nimproved access to safety shutoffs, reduction of the amount of ammonia contained within the\nsystem but necessary for system operation, and systems which will rapidly reduce the pressure\nwithin any major part of the piping/equipment system in case of emergency shutdown."
