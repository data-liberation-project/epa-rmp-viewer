Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility.  The ammonia refrigeration system contains 20,100 pounds of ammonia in a closed loop system.  The facility exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is expected to last a lifetime.  The Company went beyond normal practices in that all the ammonia lines are 304L stainless steel in order to prevent corrosion from the outside.  Ammonia does not cause corrosion of steel or stainless steel inside the lines and vessels.  Releases are prevented by the stainless steel lines and by a combination of engineering, administrative controls, and mechanical integrity of the equipment and pipe systems.  The design was by a professional engineering firm and installed by an experienced ammonia refrigeration contractor.  Engineering controls include automated component shutdowns in the unlikely event that safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation, emergency shutdown E-stops, and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nComputer air models were developed based on a worst-case release scenario involving a catastrophic structural failure of the system high pressure receiver.  The high pressure could potentially contain the la"

EPA has defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of regulated substance (anhydrous ammonia for our facility) from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  This is considered to be the distance to the endpoint of a toxic vapor cloud from a release before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short term exposures will no longer occur.  The worst case and alternate case models were produced using Marplot.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was determined using RMP*Comp.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed a prevention program which complies with the requirement of OSHA CFR29, 1910.119 Process Safety Management and EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan.  This program includes all the Elements of the PSM/RMP Regulations with emphasis on procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without releases.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter-in-place as determined necessary for the particular event.  HAZMAT and other emergency contacts would be notified immediately.  The Columbus Fire Department has been included in the Notification and Action Plan.  Chairman Foods personnel are trained to assist the responders with information only, and would not participate in an actual response if it required Level A Suites.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn August 29, 10:00 pm EDT, an operator attempted to install a new compressed air line.  All of the ammonia lines are stainless steel and all utility lines are also stainless steel except for the steam lines.  The operator turned off the air compressors and bled down the air.  However, when he got ready to cut the line he got the lines mixed and made a slight cut into the ammonia line.  The operator quickly pressed th"

There are 6 ammonia detectors in the area that also detected the ammonia concentration and would have closed the automatic valves had they not already been closed by the operator pressing the E-Stop.  All the ammonia lines are insulated except the high pressure liquid lines.  Since the incident, we painted the uninsulated stainless steel high pressure lines in all areas where there could be confusion and decreased the pipe labeling from the normal 40 feet to approximately 20 feet."
