Facilities, training, operations, and maintenance procedures are in place to store and use ton cylinders of chlorine, liquified under pressure, for disinfection of potable water.  The RMP manual has been updated as required to meet EPA guidelines.  No reportable acidents have occurred over the last five year period.  The treatment facilities have been modified and construction is now complete.  The new chlorine equipment installed is the same make and model as the existing equipment with which the operators are experienced.  The City has recently completed a vulnerability assessment and is in the process of updating the ermergency response plan to address the findings of the VA.  The updated ERP will be on site and a copy will be provided to the County emergency coordinator.  The release scenarios have been revised using the RMPComp program.  MARPLOT was used to determine the release scenario impact areas."
