The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel. \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n\n2.     The stationary source and regulated substances handled \n\nThis facility provides recreation to the community in the form of a public swimming area. Chlorine is received in ton containers. It is then used to disinfect the swimming area. This facility has equipment for unloading ton containers and equipment to utilize chlorine. Access to the chlorine storage and equipment buildings is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine. The maximum inventory of chlorine stored at this facility is 8,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release seenarios and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario \n\nWorst-Case Scenario, chlorine - Failure of a ton container of chlorine would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine. It is assumed tha"

The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) is calculated as 0.9 miles. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario, chlorine - A chlorine ton container feed valve fails, releasing gas into a closed room. The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/L (3 ppm) is  .3 miles. \n\n\n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute. \n\n\n5.    Five-year accident history \n\nWe have had no releases of chlorine resulting in off-site consequences within the last 5 years. \n\n\n\n6.    The emergency response program \n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. We have discussed this program with the Cortland County Local Emergency Planning Comniittee and the City Fire Department.\n\n7.   Planned changes to improve safety \n\nThis facility is planning to convert to solid calcium hypochlorite for disinfection. This will eliminate any risk of release of chlorine gas."
