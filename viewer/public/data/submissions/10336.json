      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc., Kingsport, Tennessee\nPropylene Storage, Fill Plant, and Ethylene Tube Trailer Storage\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we store propylene, and transfer the propylene into portable cylinders, we also store ethylene in a series of 8 manifolded large containers.  Propylene and ethylene, in the amounts handled and stored by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections,  safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA\u0012s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage of propylene and the transfer of same into portable cylinders. The propylene is used by Air Products\u0012 customers for a variety of applications such as a fuel for heating and metal processing.     The propylene is delivered into the propylene storage by the propylene supplier.  Portable cylinders"

      "SummaryText": "are filled individually by weight on a scale.  There is no chemical reaction involved.  The process is strictly the transfer of a liquefied petroleum gas from a large storage container into smaller individual portable cylinders.  The capacities of the cylinders range from approx. 20 pounds up to 100 pound cylinders. \n\nDuring this process, no products or wastes are either created nor consumed.  The fill system is equipped with a recycle valve that directs the propylene stream back to the storage tank when each cylinder is filled.   As a result, no propylene is vented to the atmosphere during the normal operation of the system.  \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the pure, single product, Propylene, a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), which is a flammable gas.  The maximum amount of this substance at this facility is:\n\n7 43775 pounds of the flammable gas, Propylene\n\nAn additional covered process at this facility is the storage of ethylene. The ethylene is used by Air Products\u0012 customers for a variety of applications such as a fuel for heating and metal processing.     The ethylene storage unit is delivered to the Kingsport site  by the ethylene supplier.  The unit is stored on the site until needed by the Air Products\u0012 customer, at which time it is transported to their site.  The storage unit is never connected to any equipment while on the APCI site, and no valves are opened or otherwise operated while on the APCI site. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the pure, single product, Ethylene, a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), which is a flammable gas.  The maximum amount of this substance at this facility is:\n\n7 14,000 pounds of the flammable gas, Ethylene\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) as defined by the EPA, associated with the Propylene process at"

      "SummaryText": "the facility is a catastrophic failure in the storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The entire propylene tank inventory of 43,775 pounds is assumed to be released instantaneously into the atmosphere at the tank location, ignited, and resulting in a VCE.   The maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of a 1 psi overpressure wave reaches receptors off site. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative case scenario\u0012s (ACS) for the propylene at this facility is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the failure of a transfer hose from the delivery truck to the propylene storage tank, resulting in a release rate of 1,390  pounds per minute, based on the tanker pump output of 100 gallons per minute. The maximum distance to the EPA defined  flammable endpoint of 1 psi reaches receptors off site. \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements  based on the Federal EPA\u0012s Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents or accidental releases of Propylene or Ethylene in the past five years,  that could have had off-site consequences.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u0012s emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u0012s First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Kingsport City Fire Department fo"
