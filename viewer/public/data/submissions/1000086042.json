This facility was previously owned and operated by Hovensa, LLC (Hovensa), and it was shutdown in 2012. On January 4, 2016 LBR bought the facility and commence redesigning and upgrading some process units taking in considerations all RMP requirements.  The restart of specific refinery process units is forecasted for the period mid-June through the third quarter 2020, with the units included in this RMP submission.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe refinery provides employment for about 800 people (LBR and Contractor employees). Many of the employees, including senior officers of LBR, live in company housing adjacent to the refinery. The reconfigured refinery can process up to 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day, using a variety of processes to convert crude oil into various petroleum products (e.g., fuel oils, diesel, kerosene, jet fuel, gasoline and propane). The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as hydrogen, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and one regulated toxic material which is anhydrous ammonia.  \r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS Worst Case Scenario-Toxic \r\nThe worst case scenario for anhydrous ammonia is failure of the ammonia storage drum containing approximately 110,000 pounds. The cloud formed from this release is expected to reach offsite receptors. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such a release and to manage the consequences, no administrative controls (including release prevention measures) or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. \r\nAlternative Release Scenario-Toxic \r\nThe toxic alternative release scenario is an anhydrous ammonia leak in the flexible hose used to load ammonia from the tank truck into the"

The emergency response program is updated, if applicable, when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or changes involving refinery personnel. The emergency response procedure changes are administered and include informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. \r\nThe overall emergency response program for LBR is handled by trained company personnel. The St. Croix US Virgin Island - Department of Plan and Natural Resources (DPNR) in charge of organizing Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and VITEMA - Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Administration are notified if the emergency might affect the public. \r\nAlthough local agencies may assist with onsite emergency response, LBR's ability to respond does not depend on such assistance. LBR has 24-hour communication capabilities with appropriate DPNR officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., VITEMA - Virgin Islands Territorial Management Administration). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training employees and implementing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of its processes. The company's policy is to protect the community and its workers from accidental releases of chemical substances and to reduce the extent and impact of a release. However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained to respond, control, contain, and mitigate the release. \r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS \r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the LBR refinery. Processes at the refinery, which are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \r\nEmployee Participation \r\nLBR requires employees to participate in all facets of their PSM and accident prevention program. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents. developing operating procedures and chemical information, and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.

The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, plant management and/or contractors. \r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\nLBR keeps a variety of technical documents used to maintain safe operation of each process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage such hazards. \r\nThe primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, What-If', or PHA checklist technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, technical and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards along with accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the various departments (i.e., Operations, Technical & Engineering, Reliability, and Maintenance). Resolution implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This risk ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, LBR periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency throughout the life of each process.

Update of the procedure included, but not limited to, Platformer start up procedure with electrolytic hydrogen as no hydrogen will be available from the other Platformers; revision of all procedures for units with furnaces to address refractory curing; new heaters operations with low NOx burners; hydrotreaters will have new sulfiding procedures.

This refresher training is conducted at least once every 3 years. All operator training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\nContractors \r\nLBR uses contractors to supplement its work force. Some contractors work on or near process equipment; therefore, the refinery (1) informs contractors of hazards known to the refinery which are related to the contractor's work and the processes in the area of such work; (2) makes sure that the contractor understands what to do in the event of an emergency; (3) develops and implements safe work practices, such as permit systems, to control contractor entrance, presence and exit from the process areas; (4) provides the contractor with site safety rules and applicable safe operating practice procedures; and (5) requires that contractors inform site safety personnel of hazards they encounter. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, LBR evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as a part of the contractor selection process.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections/tests and documenting results, (4) preventive maintenance, (5) correcting identified deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures.

Examples of these include (1) process unit control entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag-out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.
