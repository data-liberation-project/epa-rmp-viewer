This facility was previously owned and operated by Hovensa, LLC (Hovensa), and it was shutdown in 2012. On January 4, 2016 LBR bought the facility and commence redesigning and upgrading some process units taking in considerations all RMP requirements.  The restart of specific refinery process units is forecasted for the period mid-June through the third quarter 2020, with the units included in this RMP submission.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe refinery provides employment for about 800 people (LBR and Contractor employees). Many of the employees, including senior officers of LBR, live in company housing adjacent to the refinery. The reconfigured refinery can process up to 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day, using a variety of processes to convert crude oil into various petroleum products (e.g., fuel oils, diesel, kerosene, jet fuel, gasoline and propane). The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as hydrogen, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and one regulated toxic material which is anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS Worst Case Scenario-Toxic \n\nThe worst case scenario for anhydrous ammonia is failure of the ammonia storage drum containing approximately 110,000 pounds. The cloud formed from this release is expected to reach offsite receptors. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such a release and to manage the consequences, no administrative controls (including release prevention measures) or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario-Toxic \n\nThe toxic alternative release scenario is an anhydrous ammonia leak in the flexible hose used to load ammonia from the tank truck into the "

Also, it assumes that LBR personnel will stop the release within 30 minutes. No administrative controls (including release prevention measures) or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. \n\nWorst Case Scenario-Flammables \n\nThree worst-case scenarios involving flammable substances were identified.\n\nThe first worst case scenario is a failure of the one of two east butane storage sphere containing approximately 5,300,000 pounds of liquid butane, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The second worst case scenario is a failure of one of three west butane storage sphere containing approximately 5,000,000 pounds of liquid butane, also resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. \n\n\n\nUnder certain circumstances, these scenarios could reach offsite public receptors. The vapor cloud explosion analyses were performed utilizing DNV Technica's PHAST dispersion software, and Baker-Strehlow blast overpressure method as employed by Wilfred Baker Engineering, Inc. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage the consequences, no administrative controls (including release prevention measures) or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario-Flammables\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances is a leak in the liquid pump associated with the Frationation tower overhead receiver pump at D-4104 overhead receiver,   resulting in a release of approximately 5,200 lbs per hour pentane and lighter material .The released ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. \n\nThe vapor cloud explosion analyses were performed utilizing DNV Technica's PHAST dispersion software, and Baker-Strehlow blast overpressure method as employed by Wilfred Baker Engineering, Inc.

No administrative controls (including release prevention measures) or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nLBR is commitment to the safety of employees, public safety and the surrounding environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training employees and implementing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of its processes. The company's policy is to protect the community and its workers from accidental releases of chemical substances and to reduce the extent and impact of a release. However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained to respond, control, contain, and mitigate the release. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS \n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the LBR refinery. Processes at the refinery, which are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\nEmployee Participation \n\nLBR requires employees to participate in all facets of their PSM and accident prevention program. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents. developing operating procedures and chemical information, and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.

JSA - Job safety analysis - audits.\n\n?    Review and update all personal and process safety procedures.\n\n?    Extensive training programs for operators and maintenance personnel.\n\nThese initiatives are being developed by different teams to further promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, plant management and/or contractors. \n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nLBR keeps a variety of technical documents used to maintain safe operation of each process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. (Specific departments, i.e. Maintenance, Engineering, Safety, Reliability, within the refinery are assigned responsibility to maintaining up-to-date process safety information). A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate necessary process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS) and HAZCOM list for each unit. The refinery ensures that each process is maintained within acceptable operating limits, by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automatic shutdown systems). \n\nLBR maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of each process units and associated equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature ratings, area electrical classification, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures "

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage such hazards. \n\nThe primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, \"\"What-If\"', or PHA checklist technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, technical and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards along with accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the various departments (i.e., Operations, Technical & Engineering, Reliability, and Maintenance). Resolution implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This risk ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, LBR periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency throughout the life of each process. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team finding"

Update of the procedure included, but not limited to, Platformer start up procedure with electrolytic hydrogen as no hydrogen will be available from the other Platformers; revision of all procedures for units with furnaces to address refractory curing; new heaters operations with low NOx burners; hydrotreaters will have new sulfiding procedures. These procedures are referenced by certified operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are certified annually, or as often as necessary to ensure that they are current and accurate. \n\nIn addition, LBR maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to abnormal operating conditions. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \n\nTraining \n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, LBR has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New process operators receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing such training, a new operator is paired with a senior certified operator to learn process- specific duties and tasks.

This refresher training is conducted at least once every 3 years. All operator training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nContractors \n\nLBR uses contractors to supplement its work force. Some contractors work on or near process equipment; therefore, the refinery (1) informs contractors of hazards known to the refinery which are related to the contractor's work and the processes in the area of such work; (2) makes sure that the contractor understands what to do in the event of an emergency; (3) develops and implements safe work practices, such as permit systems, to control contractor entrance, presence and exit from the process areas; (4) provides the contractor with site safety rules and applicable safe operating practice procedures; and (5) requires that contractors inform site safety personnel of hazards they encounter. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, LBR evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as a part of the contractor selection process. Also, refinery personnel periodically monitor and evaluate contractor performance to verify that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations once onsite. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\nLBR conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
