These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrctions required to prevent these releases.  The equipment is reviewed by onsite personnel, registered engineers, and certified refrigeration contractors as required.\n\nIncidental emergency response is provided by onsite personnel.  Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operations such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release.  Emergency response for a major release event will be provided by local fire and police departments with mutual aide response.\n\nEmergency response training is conducted yearly and as required for new employees.\n\nAll ammonia refrigeration maintenance and operations personnel are required to be trained and become familiar with the company's Safety and Operating Procedures and Emergency Response Plan.  Maintenance and operations personnel will also be required to become familiar with this RMP.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThis facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia in it's produce cooling and cold storage operations.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs described above, the program consists of pre-startup inspection, emergency response, and regular training.  A thorough review of the system including a HAZOP analysis was performed prior to startup for the 1998 season.  Safety and equipment operational training will be conducted on a yearly basis and will include equipment operational procedures, emergency repsonse procedures, review of Business Response Procedures, and evacuation procedures.\n\nRefrigeration equipment will be reviewed as required when changes to equipment occu"
