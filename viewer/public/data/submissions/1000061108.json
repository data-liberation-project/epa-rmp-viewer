Our policy is to implement the necessary controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, we have trained personnel who will respond to control and contain the release, thereby reducing potential impact on our surrounding community.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations is located in the city of Carson, California.  The site occupies 650 acres and employs more than 1000 people.  The refinery has capacity to process approximately 265,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce a variety of petroleum products, including gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and petroleum coke, as well as products such as propylene, natural gas liquids and other petrochemicals.  The facility also includes the Watson Cogeneration Unit.

Waste heat from the process is then used to supply steam to the refinery for process use.\r\n\r\nThe refinery has several regulated flammable substances, such as propane, butane, pentane, etc.  In addition, the facility uses ammonia, which is a regulated toxic chemical, in the Cogeneration facility and in the refinery.  The primary use of ammonia is in the air pollution control system for the reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides.  It is also used for process corrosion control. \r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe LAR has instituted an employee participation program to consult with the employees in the development and implementation of all the Process Safety Management (PSM) elements and employee participation is encouraged at all levels of the organization.  Special groups, committees and individuals have been identified as having PSM responsibilities at the refinery. Nevertheless, all employees are encouraged to raise specific suggestions or concerns related to process safety management by contacting their immediate supervisor or the PSM coordinator.  The LAR Employee Participation Program is described in Standing Instruction  PSM-001.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations maintains extensive documentation that is used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response information is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) contained in Operating Manuals and Design Process Books.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nA primary element of the LAR Prevention Program is the Process Hazard Analysis, or PHA.  The PHA is performed to identify hazards in a process. Through this process, information is obtained that will help improve process safety and system reliability, as well as reducing the potential consequences of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Because of the size and complexity of many of the refinery processes, the HAZOP methodology has been selected as the most appropriate PHA metho"

A HAZOP team at LAR typically consists of a process engineer, an experienced operator, an instrument & electrical engineer/technician, a mechanical engineer, and other part time team members.  The team leader (a.k.a. the HAZOP facilitator) is fully knowledgeable in the proper implementation of the HAZOP methodology.  Part time team members typically provide specialized expertise in areas such as safety and health, and equipment inspection/metallurgy/corrosion.  Standing Instruction PSM 003 summarizes the LAR policy/procedure for conducting PHAs.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe LAR provides written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: process startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  The operating procedures describe tasks to be performed, data to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The LAR takes steps to update the procedures to reflect current operations and the procedures are certified annually by the operating staff.  In addition, operating procedures are updated when there are any changes in the process as a result of the management of change procedures.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating or maintaining a process.  Initial training for operating and maintenance personnel who are new to a process includes health and safety training, fundamentals of refining, process overview and process fundamentals.  Job specific training is given to operators assigned to an operating unit.

Once an operator is qualified in a position, they are required to recertify for the job every three years by comprehensive testing.  Testing is also conducted on all OSHA-required safety and health training.  Employee training and certification records are documented, both in hard copy and computerized training records.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe TESORO Los Angeles Refinery - Carson Operations uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities, or to perform tasks requiring skills that are needed on a non-routine basis.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about refinery safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  Additionally, all contractors that work on or near process units at the Carson Refinery must have completed a compulsory training program a (Refinery Safety Overview - RSO) that provides a standardized baseline of process safety training for all contractors that perform work at local area refineries.

Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\n\r\nA pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is carried out in conjunction with an MOC or a new project or construction (Standing Instruction PSM-005).  The PSSR is conducted before implementing a modification to a process, or commissioning a new project.  \r\n\t\r\nAs it is LAR practice to conduct a PHA for various types of changes and for all new projects, there could be some recommendations resulting from the PHA that are required to be addressed before implementation.  A PSSR is carried out in the form of a checklist to comply with requirements of the applicable regulations.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nA mechanical integrity program is in place for the continued integrity of process equipment at LAR.  Equipment used to process, transfer or store hazardous chemicals have been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.  This program covers: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief systems and safety devices, emergency shutdown systems, electronic controls, and rotating equipment (e.g., pumps and compressors.)  LAR also reviews the maintenance programs and shutdown schedules to determine if there are areas where \"breakdown\" maintenance is used rather than an on going mechanical integrity program.  Elements of the mechanical integrity program are as follows: (1) categorization of equipment and instrumentation, (2) inspection and testing program, (3) maintenance program, (4) documentation, and (5) quality assurance program.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits\r\n\r\nAll non-routine work"

The Hot Work Permit which is discussed below.\r\n\t\r\nA hot work permit describes the steps that operating, maintenance and contractor personnel must follow to obtain the necessary clearance to perform different types of work involving hot surfaces, flame, or energized equipment.  The hazards identified for the work being performed are communicated to those personnel performing the work and also to those personnel who may be affected by the work being performed, especially when the work being performed could affect the safety of the process.  The hot work permit procedures refer to and coordinate the following procedures and authorizations, as applicable: lockout/tagout, line breaking, and confined space entry.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe LAR has implemented a Management of Change (MOC) procedure (Standing Instruction PSM-002) to manage changes to the refinery units.  Changes are defined as modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials, or processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\".  \r\n\t\r\nPSM 002 includes modifications in the operating procedures that contain operating parameters such as pressure limits, temperature ranges, flow rates, and other process variables.  The Management of Change procedure also covers changes in process technology and changes to equipment and instrumentation.

It applies to the investigation of different types of incidents that may occur in the facility.  The intent of an incident investigation is to identify the cause of incidents and to prevent or minimize their recurrence.  A multi disciplinary team is assembled to gather the facts of the events and to identify, to the extent possible, the cause of the incident.  Team members are selected on the basis of their training, knowledge, and ability to contribute to a team effort to investigate the incident and usually include an operator from the area where the incident occurred.  The operator's knowledge of the events can help to identify and verify relevant facts about the incident.  It is the goal of the investigation to treat all involved individuals in a fair, open and consistent manner.  The incident report, its findings and recommendations are entered in the incident investigation tracking system, which can be accessed by all employees, and also distributed to others who can benefit from the information.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, qualified Tesoro staff periodically conducts audits operating facilities, including the Carson Refinery, to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

The ICS has a hierarchical (chain of command) structure, which places the highest responsibility on the Emergency Manager, who has the overall responsibility for the emergency.  The Emergency Manager delegates direct command responsibilities to the Incident Commander, who has the highest authority during an emergency.  The Emergency Manger is a liaison between the Incident Commander, the public, and the Company.  The next level of responsibility resides on four section chiefs: Command Chief, Operations Chief, Planning Chief, and Logistics/Finance Chief.  All section chiefs receive directions from the Incident Commander during an emergency.  Each position in the organization has specific assignments and responsibilities, which are defined in the ERP.
