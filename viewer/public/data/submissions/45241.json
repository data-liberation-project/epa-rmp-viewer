A BULK HEAD AT THE TRUCK UNLOAD WAS ADDED.  BREAKAWAYS WERE ADDED AT THE RISER AS WELL.\n\nTHE WORST CASE AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED AND SHARED WITH OUR LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS AS PART OF AN ON-GOING TRAINING PROGRAM.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE EMERGENCY ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE EMERGENCY MEETING PLACE AND EACH OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDING AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\nTHIS COMPANY MAINTAINS AND OPERATES THEIR NH3 PLANT IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ALL STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
