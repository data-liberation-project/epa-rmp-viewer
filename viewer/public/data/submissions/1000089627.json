Our personnel periodically monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\nA compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively.  Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but is independent of our facility, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention.  The results of audits are documented, and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error. In addition to the prevention program, the Innospec Performance Chemicals-Salisbury Plant has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public, and the environment.

Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses.  A team comprising personnel with engineering, chemists, operations, safety, environmental and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\r\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years or whenever a significant change is made.   The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\nOur engineers, operators, chemists and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new or improved process.

SDSs are available to all employees, as well as the emergency responders in our community.  All chemicals on site have an SDS.\r\nImportant process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents may include (1) operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrumentation diagrams, and (7) other information that is important for understanding the design intent, operating limits, and hazards of each pro"

      "SummaryText": "orth America is responsible for overall implementation of the policy, ensuring that the policy is available to all employees and is made available to any interested party on request.  The VP Manufacturing, North America will also ensure that resources are adequate to enact the policy. All employees and contractors have a responsibility for their own safety and environmental performance and also that of others.\r\nWe have implemented maintenance and inspection programs that ensure site integrity.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  Examples of controls to prevent releases include (1) installation of pressure relief valves to prevent rupture of vessels due to over pressurization, (2) routine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good condition, (3) using materials of construction that are compatible with the process chemistry and (4) using water scrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Innospec Performance Chemicals-Salisbury Plant is primarily involved in manufacturing of personal care products (e.g. bases for soaps, shampoos, body washes, etc.).  One raw material used to make some of the products is covered by the risk management program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  However, we also use a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  Following is a brief description of the facility and a list of RMP-regulated processes at our facility.\r\nThe Innospec Performance Chemicals-Salisbury Plant is located on approximately 40 acres.  The covered chemical currently in use at the site is phosphorous trichloride (PCl3).  While the process that utilizes the PCl3 is not a covered process, the storage of the"
