This Risk Management Program as implemented will assist to prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of chemical releases.\r\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR Part 68.155.\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nDWU implements a preventive maintenance program and inspection and testing program to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide immediate corrective response to any accident.\r\nThe Eastside WTP personnel are trained to respond in the event of a chemical release incident.  Emergency response to accidental releases is also coordinated with the City of Dallas Police and Fire Department and the State and Local Emergency Response Centers.\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Eastside WTP utilizes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (regulated substances) as disinfectants in the drinking water treatment process.  \r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nA Hazard Analysis as well as written process safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.

The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a successful RMP program is maintained, implemented, and followed by appropriate personnel.  \r\nPersonnel have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up.  Each incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia in the workplace will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP.  \r\nThe WTP chlorine and anhydrous ammonia system technologies are not confidential and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP.\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nIn the last 5 years, the Eastside WTP has had three accidental releases, which are described as follows.  In addition, the date of corrective action implementation is noted:\r\n\u00bf\t10/11/2011 - An apprentice electrician was exposed to residual chlorine gas while working in the Chlorine Room.  The incident occurred while mechanics were connecting a railcar and replacing an unloading hose to the chlorine feed system.  Additional training for operators was conducted in proper operation of unloading and loading equipment on 10/12/2011.\r\n\u00bf\t6/23/2011 - Less than 1 pound of chlorine gas was released to the atmosphere during this event.

This caused corrosion (from the liquid chlorine) of the pressure sensor unit and ultimately caused it to fail and create a leak.  One employee was sent to the hospital emergency room for evaluation; no injury was found.  Rupture disks and fixed chlorine pressure alarms were checked and replaced in all components of the chlorine piping system on 6/23/2011.\r\n\u00bf\t6/15/2009 - An employee was disassembling a component of the liquid ammonia system in the Evaporator Room of the Ammonia Building.  The component contained liquid ammonia and sprayed the employee in the face.  Employee's eyes were flushed and taken to local hospital, treated, and released.  Additional training was provided for employees who work in this area to follow proper procedures on 6/16/2009.\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe RMP Emergency Response Plan for the WTP includes the following elements:\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases\r\n\u00bf\tDocumentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures \r\n\u00bf\tProcedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance\r\n\u00bf\tTraining for all employees in relevant procedures\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the stationary source and ensure that employees are informed of changes\r\nCopies of emergency procedures are maintained at the WTP Administration and Maintenance Buildings.
