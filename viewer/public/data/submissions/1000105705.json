      "SummaryText": "CARLISLE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (CCM) is located at 101 ARMOR DRIVE, SIKESTON, MISSOURI and manufacturers rigid polyisocyanurate foam insulating panels for use in commercial and industrial roofing applications.  The company will employ approximately 70 people at the facility at full and planned capacity.  CARLISLE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS occupies a 500,000 square foot facility in New Madrid County in Sikeston, MO.  \nThe polyisocyanurate foam insulating panels are produced by reacting a polyol (POLY) in a blend including a flame retardant and catalyst with polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (ISO).  Pentane material is used as an expanding or blowing agent in the production of the panels.  Different varieties of pentane material can be used including various blends of n-pentane, isopentane, and cyclopentane.  Isopentane and n-pentane are regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule with a 10,000 pound threshold.  Cyclopentane is not regulated under the RMP Rule. CARLISLE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard in 29 CFR 1910.119 for all three isomers of pentane and maintains one plan to meet both the RMP and PSM requirements.\nThe facility receives a liquid pentane blend via tank truck or rail car and stores it in a 25,107-gallon aboveground pressure vessel for use in the production process.  This volume equates to a pentane material storage capacity of 129,823 to 154,950 pounds depending upon which pentane blend is used.  For purposes of the Risk Management Plan submittal a maximum of 131,080 pounds of n-pentane and 129,823 pounds of isopentane are addressed.  Cyclopentane which is not regulated under the RMP regulation would have a maximum quantity of 154,950 pounds.  Throughout the RMP and Process Safety Management (PSM) documentation at the facility the combination of various isomers of pentane is simply referred to as pentane.  No distinction is made to exclude a possible cyclopentane portion of the"

      "SummaryText": "blend from the RMP component of the regulations.  There are TWO 25,107-gallon storage vessels on site, this is for expected future expansion but at the initial production stage the second vessel is not connected nor in service, the RMP will be updated accordingly when that expansion is planned.  \nThe process with respect to PSM and RMP regulations starts with the unloading of pentane into the storage tank and continues through the point where cured panels are cut to size.  Process steps include transfer of pentane to a metering skid, injection of pentane at high pressure into a polyol blend, and reaction of the polyol with ISO, using pentane as the expanding agent, to form foam on top of a substrate.  The chemical mixture and substrate are drawn into the laminator, where the mixture adheres to the substrate and a top-sheet as the solid foam is formed.   At the crosscut saw station, the sheet is cut into long panels and the edges are trimmed to a precise 4-foot width.  The long panels then move to a gang saw station where additional crosscutting reduces the panels to the desired lengths, typically 4, 8 or 12 feet.  At this point of the process, production of the foam panels using the pentane blowing agent is complete representing the end of the process that is covered under the PSM and RMP regulations."
