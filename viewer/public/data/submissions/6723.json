Manufacturing Plant is a\n   recreational vehicle  seat  manufacturer. The scope  of\n   business  includes injection   molding,  polyurethane\n   foam  production,   vacuum forming,   sewing   and\n   assembly.  At  the  foam   production department we use a\n   mixture of 2,4 - Toluene Diisocyanate  and 2,6  - Toluene\n   Diisocyanate as a catalyst. There are two  5000 gallon\n   tanks to hold a catalyst mixture and a polyol. Because we\n   have more than minimum threshold for regulated\n   substances, 2,  4  and 2, 6 - TDI, Tri-Con Manufacturing\n   Plant is required to develop Risk Management Program.\n   Based on the modeling done with  RMP COMP and other\n   factors, Tri-Con Manufacturing  Plant is Level 2 program\n   for those two chemicals.\n   2,  4  and 2, 6 - TDI is contained in the 5000 gallon\n   holding tank,  a 55 gallon day tank, piping system which\n   connects  the day  tank  and  the  foam head and the\n   foam  head  where  the catalyst  and the polyol are mixed\n   and shot into a  mold.  The chemical  is  delivered from\n   our supplier, Bayer,  by  a  tank truck  periodically.\n   The maximum quantity of 2, 4 and 2,  6  TDI  mixture\n   that Tri-Con stores at any time  is  about  5000 gallons,\n   which weighs about 50,000 pounds (2,4 - TDI   35,000\n   pounds, 2,6 - TDI 12,500 pounds respectively).\n   \n2.   TRI-CON'S APPROACH TO CHEMICAL SAFETY\n\n   Tri-Con's management is committed to minimize negative\n   impact to  the  environment. As a way to ensure the\n   chemical  safety, Tri-Con is trying to be registered in\n   ISO 14001.  Through  ISO 14001, we can achieve continual\n   improvement by internal audit, corrective action and\n   management review. Training is  also  an important  part\n   of ISO 14001. Work instruction is set  up  for certain\n   processes.  Deviation from  the  procedure  and  work\n   instruction  will be pointed out by internal  audit"

      "SummaryText": ",  and\n   the corrective  action  will take place. Maintenance\n   program  and emergency response procedures are also parts\n   of ISO 14001  and strictly followed.\n   Although ISO 14001 covers chemicals that are not part of\n   this Risk  Management  Program,  the  process  covered\n   under  Risk Management Program is one of the most\n   important aspects.\n   \n   \n3.    THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE\nRELEASE\n   SCENARIO\n\n   THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\n      The  worst case scenario for our situation would be a\n      total release of  TDI mixture from the 5000 gallon\n      holding  tank. There are several possibilities for\n      this to happen, but  we based  our calculation on the\n      scenario that the valve  that is  located at the\n      bottom of the tank would rapture and the whole\n      content would be spilled. The size of  the  possible\n      rapture and the duration of the spill is described  in\n      the report.  The holding tank is located in a dike\n      that  would hold  the  whole  content from the tank.\n      The  modeling  of dispersion was done using RMP COMP\n      that we downloaded  from the  EPA  web  site. The\n      storage tank is  enclosed  in  the building  and the\n      dike that will hold the whole content  of the  tank ,\n      thus reducing the chance of release outside  of the\n      facility.\n      \n      \n   THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\n      The  alternative and most likely scenario is that the\n      pipe that\n      connects the day tank and the foam head would rapture\n      and  spill  the chemical. The size of the possible\n      rapture and  the  duration of the spill is described\n      in the report. If  this  type  of spill occurs, it\n      would  most  likely  be contained  fairly  quickly. As\n      soon as  we  shut  down  the system,  the pressure\n      will be balanced and  the spill  will stop.  What we\n      would lose is the chemical that  is  in  the piping\n      system, which is about 10 gallons. The spill  woul"

THE  GENERAL  ACCIDENTAL  RELEASE  PREVENTION  PROGRAM\nAND\n   CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n      As  I  mentioned earlier, Tri-Con Industries,  Ltd.\n      has  a commitment  to  reduce negative environmental\n      impact.  The tool\n      that  we  use  is  ISO 14001. ISO  14001  Manual  and\n      Procedures  include process control, preventive\n      maintenance and\n      emergency  response  procedures.  ISO  14001,   would\n      require  Tri-Con  Industries,  Ltd.  to  achieve\n      continual improvement by utilizing internal audit,\n      corrective  action and  management review. Internal\n      audit would point out  any deviation from the required\n      preventive maintenance  program and  emergency\n      response procedures. When a non-conformance to  ISO\n      14001  Procedures is found, the corrective  action\n      will  take  place  and  the problem  will  be  solved.\n      The\n      management  periodically reviews  the  result  of\n      internal audit   and  Manual/Procedure  to  improve\n      on  the  system itself.\n      General  chemical safety for the process  that\n      applies  to RMP is a part of this ISO 14001 system.\n      We   also  plan  to  participate  in  voluntary\ncompliance\n      program  offered  by  the State of Nebraska\n      Department  of Labor  every  year.  An inspector will\n      visit  our  facility and  conduct  an  inspection.\n      This  program  will  help  us identify  unsafe\n      conditions throughout the plant,  as  well as  the\n      department that has the covered process under  RMP.\n      Furthermore,  our  Safety Committee  will  conduct\n      monthly inspection.\n      \n5.

The  clean up will be contracted out\n      to  some  firms that\n      specialize in hazardous material clean up.  We  plan\n      to  have  a chemical spill drill involving the HAZMAT\n      team in  the fall of 1999. We plant to conduct a drill\n      at  least once a year.\n      \n7.   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe  plan to  register in ISO 14001 in the fall  of  1999.\nCurrently,  we  are  setting up an Environmental  Management\nSystem  manual and procedures, and training our associates. The\nintegrity of the process system will be  checked  more frequently\nand  regularly.
