The Facility Policy.\n\n    The owners, management, and employees of Granger's Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and city officials to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n \n  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n  The maximum quantity stored would be 158,000 pounds in our three - 12,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a truck holding 45,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario.\n\n  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,600 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.63 miles.\n\n  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .83 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n\n  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n  - have caused any deaths, injuries, o"

The emergency response program.\n\n  - The facility has:\n a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n  b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n  c.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n  \n  Safety improvement is an on-going process at Granger's Coop.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n  Keith Wallace, General Manager\n\nApril 28, 1999"
