The Westend Facility is owned and operated by Searles Valley Minerals which is a sub-division of Nirma Limited.  Searles Valley Minerals\u00bf initial submittal for this facility was made to USEPA and to the San Bernardino County Fire Department on June 21, 1999.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning and update requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (also known as the Federal Risk Management Plan Regulations) and the California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Article 3, Section 2745.3 (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan \u00bf CalARP RMP Regulations).  The scope of the Federal RMP and CalARP RMP includes all operations conducted at the subject facility that involve the storage, handling and/or use of anhydrous ammonia (i.e., anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Westend Facility above the threshold quantity).\n\nSearles Valley Minerals is strongly committed to the health and safety of its employees, the public and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the comprehensive accidental release prevention program implemented at the Westend Facility covering aspects of operations such as design, installation, operations and maintenance, training, emergency response and other areas.  It is the Policy of Searles Valley Minerals to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.  This is achieved through strong leadership, teamwork, effective communications, and by striving towards continuous i"

Searles Valley Minerals extracts, chemically processes and ships minerals and inorganic chemical compounds to customers all over the world.  The company currently produces soda ash, sodium borates, boric acid and natural sulfate.  \n\nDescription of Regulated Substance Use\nSearles Valley Minerals\u00bf Westend Facility produces borax and sodium sulfate by processing Brines obtained from Searles Lake.  \nAnhydrous ammonia is used (in the manufacturing of borax and sodium sulfate) as a refrigerant (for cooling) in a closed loop system.  The cooling process (i.e., the use of anhydrous ammonia) is a 24-hour per day, 365-day per year operation that is essential to manufacturing operations conducted at the Westend Facility.\n\nThere are four distinct uses of anhydrous ammonia at the Westend Facility:\n1.\tTo cool the gas-turbine generator inlet air (thus increasing the generator\u00bfs capacity and efficiency);\n2.\tTo chill brine in the borax manufacturing process (thus removing the heat of crystallization);\n3.\tTo chill brine in the sulfate crystallization process; and\n4.\tTo reduce NOx emissions in a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage, handling and use system at the Westend Facility consists of the following major components:\n\u00bf\tThe main high pressure receiver;\n\u00bf\tFour liquid recirculating units (LRUs);\n\u00bf\tSeven ammonia compressors;\n\u00bf\tSix evaporative condensers (i.e., cooling towers);\n\u00bf\tThe SCR unit and injectors, etc.;\n\u00bf\tTransfer piping and supports; and\n\u00bf\tProcess instrumentation, detection and monitoring devices.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage, handling and use system at the Westend Facility consists of an assortment of process vessels, heat exchangers and compressors connected via an extensive network of piping in a closed loop system.  Anhydrous ammonia is kept under high pressure (and therefore in a liquefied form) in the main High Pressure Receiver (HPR).  The HPR supplies four Liquid Recirculating Units (LRU"

The LRUs in turn supply liquid ammonia to their process where the pressure of liquid ammonia is reduced through expansion valves.  This pressure reduction results in a transformation of liquid ammonia to vapor phase and results in cooling.  As the ammonia vapor moves through the process, unwanted heat is transferred from the process to the ammonia vapor indirectly (the desired end result).  This indirect heat transfer results in a warming of the ammonia vapor (thus losing its cooling value).  The ammonia vapor is therefore compressed, cooled indirectly (in condensers/cooling towers), liquefied and returned to the main High Pressure Receiver (making it available again).  LRU Nos. 1 and 2 are dedicated to cooling the inlet air for the gas turbine generators and the SCR Unit, LRU No. 3 is dedicated to the Sulfate Crystallization Process and LRU No. 4 is dedicated to the Borax Manufacturing Process.\n\nSite Security\nA chain link fence surrounds the Westend Facility.  Additionally, the Facility is protected via manned 24-hour security.  These site security provisions are intended to prevent unauthorized access to Facility areas including those areas where anhydrous ammonia is stored, handled or used, thus adding a level of safety for the storage of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility.\n\nES 2.0\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n\u00bf\tthe worst case release; and\n\u00bf\tan alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario).\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categor"

      "SummaryText": "ies of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nIn this scenario, the main Anhydrous Ammonia High Pressure Receiver on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.  This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the area where the receiver located).  It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event.  However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded.  This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely.  In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 85,190-pounds of anhydrous ammonia could be released (administrative controls limit the vessel\u00bfs capacity to 85-percent full).  The release of ammonia would occur outdoors.  Thus, it was assumed that the ammonia released during the catastrophic accident forms a cloud of ammonia vapor which is free to migrate off-site.  No liquid pooling was considered to occur during the release (this assumption is conservative in nature and results in the largest estimated vulnerable zone).  Utilizing the BREEZE DEGADIS PLUS MODEL, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 2.4-miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nAlternative release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur are those which may result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 43,000-pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  These scenarios include situations such as accidental releases during anhydrous ammonia delivery to- or loading of- the main high pressure receiver at the facility, pinhole leaks in either the high pressure or low pressure anhydrous ammonia transfer piping (which contain anhydrous ammonia in either liquid or vapor phase), a partial or complete failure of the anhydrous ammonia transfer lines (containing anhydrous ammonia in"

In order to be conservative in the estimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that 43,000-pounds of anhydrous ammonia (in liquid phase) is released due to a failure of a three-inch anhydrous ammonia liquid transfer line connected to Liquid Recirculating Unit No. 3 (the vessel does not have an automatic shutoff valve.  The failure was assumed to occur within four feet of the connection to the Unit.  The resulting cloud of ammonia vapor was assumed to freely migrate off-site.
