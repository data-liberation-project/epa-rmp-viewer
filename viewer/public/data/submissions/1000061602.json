This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain release. \r\n\r\nContinuous improvement in safety and environmental performance will be achieved, among other things, through the company's Employee Safety Process, Tenets of Operation, guiding principles, and RAPTOR (Revealing At Risk Potentials Through Observing and Reporting) Program. Planned changes to improve safety are reviewed and adjusted annually. They are also included in the yearly budgets; and incorporated into the performance management systems/practice throughout the organization. These planned changes include, but are not limited to, safety related capital projects,\r\nsafety programs/initiatives, procedure improvements, and SOP validations.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny/Old Ocean consists of six covered processes linked by multiple pipelines. The complex, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of State Highway 35 and FM 524, about 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston. Sweeny/Old Ocean also operates a terminal\r\nand storage facility, along with the pipelines that connect this facility to the main plant and its markets.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.
