Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the VERDINE STREET WATER TREATMENT FACILITY are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the. process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the CITY OF SULPHUR FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facilities primary activities encompass TREATMENT OF WELL WATER FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. We have I regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Chlorine. The regulated substance at our facility is used for treatment of well water for human consumption.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 4000.00 lb.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. Some sections below briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n4. Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis\n\n\n\nHaving determined that the chlorine is the only regulated substance, a worst-case analysis for the chlorine was conducted. The city of sulfur uses chlorine for a disinfectant in the public water supply. The chlorine "

When the cylinder being used becomes empty, valves are used to disconnect the empty cylinder and to connect the full cylinder to the process.  As required, it was assumed the entire 2000 pounds of chlorine was released into the air at one time.  It was assumed that no administrative controls or passive mitigation were used to limit the quantity that could be released. Using EPA?s requirements and RMPComp32, it was determined that the distance to the endpoint is 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis\n\n\n\nIn addition to the worst-case analysis and alternative release analysis were performed using chlorine as the regulated substance. The alternative release scenario assumed that the chlorine cylinder was punctured resulting in a 0.75 square inch hole. The tank pressure was assumed to be 90 psi, the tank temperature was assumed to be 80? F, the topography was chosen to be urban, and the release duration was 10 minutes. It was assumed that no administrative controls or passive mitigation were used.  This resulted in a total of 1660 pounds of chlorine being released. Using RMPComp32, the distance to toxic endpoint was calculated to be 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\n5. Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe VERDINE STREET WATER TREATMENT FACILITY maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the inspection and testing of all equipment related to chemical injection. The studies are undertaken by qualified personnel. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of saf"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\n\nThe VERDINE STREET WATER TREATMENT FACILITY has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity    .\n\nThe VERDINE STREET WATER TREATMENT FACILITY carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the VERDINE STREET WATER TREATMENT FACILITY to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted on an as needed basis at the VERDINE STREET WATER TREATMENT FACILITY.
