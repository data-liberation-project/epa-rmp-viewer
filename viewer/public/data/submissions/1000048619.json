The refrigeration system is a basic closed-loop, mechanical refrigeration system. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pump or pressure differential to the production and process area evaporators for cooling and freezing purposes. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the evaporators returns to the recirculators in the engine room. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 125 to 185 psig. The maximum allowable working pressure is 250 psig. The quantity of ammonia used in the system to maintain the required refrigeration is 17,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nAs part of the PSM program, Stella and Chewy's has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Stella and Chewy's implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Stella and Chewy's to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Oak Creek, WI facility. The PSM program developed and implemented at Stella and Chewy's includes the following steps:\n\n\n\nWritten plans for implementing employee "

An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been developed that includes coordination with local response agencies, procedures for employees to follow in the event of an accidental release of ammonia and a list of emergency phone numbers. Employees have been trained on how to use the plan and drills carried out annually.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Stella and Chewy's, Inc. regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety. Currently, there are no changes planned for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nUpdate to Planned Changes:\n\n\n\nDue to increased product demand additional Freeze Dryers have been installed to meet this demand\n\nand two additional compressors were installed to handle the additional cooling load. The ammonia\n\ncharge was increased to be able to supply the required refrigerant to the additional freeze dryers.\n\n\n\nFuture changes include the addition of a freeze tunnel.\n\n"
