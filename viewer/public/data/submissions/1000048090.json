      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nConemaugh Power Station is a coal-fired, electric power generating station in New Florence, Pennsylvania. This 1,750-acre facility, known as Conemaugh Station, is located 13 miles northwest of Johnstown, PA, between the Conemaugh River and Route 2008. \r\n\r\nConemaugh Station employs approximately 200 full-time staff and a considerable number of contract employees.  The secondary economic impact of the facility on its many material and services suppliers is significant.  For example, the station provides employment for an estimated 1200 coal miners and about 100 truck drivers.\r\n\r\nThe facility generates 1700 MW of power from two identical, 850 MW units. Each unit has a pollution control system, including electrostatic precipitators for particulate, wet limestone scrubbers for sulfur dioxides, SCR, and special burners to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\r\n\r\nConemaugh Station's policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\na. PRIMARY ACTIVITIES \r\n\r\nThis facility is a coal-fired, electric power generating station.\r\n\r\nb. USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES - 29% aqueous ammonia is used at Conemaugh station for water treatment and as the reagent in the SCR systems (installed in 2014).  Anhydrous ammonia was previously used as a flue gas conditioner but it was completely removed from the site October 26, 2012. \r\n\r\nNo other toxic or flammable materials are stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold.\r\n\r\nc. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED \r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia is transported, stored and conveyed as a liquid. Four 66,700 gallon tanks are used to store the 29% aqueous ammonia for the SCR.  Administrative controls are used to ensure that the tanks are not filled above the 90% level. To be conserv"

      "SummaryText": "ative, the amount reported as the 'maximum quantity on-site' assumes the tanks are 100% full.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO \r\n\r\na. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario assumes that two 66,700-gallon tanks of the aqueous ammonia catastrophically rupture and the entire contents are released onto the pavement.  The worst case release scenario also assumes that the tanks are filled to 100%.  The quantity released in the event is calculated as:\r\n\r\n133,400 gallons * 8.3456 lb/gal * 0.8974 =  999,078 lb\r\n\r\nb. DISTANCES TO ENDPOINT \r\n\r\nThe offsite consequences of these accidental releases were evaluated with a screening computer dispersion model (RMP*COMP, version 1.07).  Offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case scenario must include highly improbable weather conditions: a wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mph), \"F\" atmospheric stability class, and the highest daily maximum temperature and average humidity observed over the previous three years. The more typical meteorological parameters would be a mean wind speed of 9.1 mph and \"D\" atmospheric stability.\r\n\r\nThe maximum calculated distance to the endpoint using the RMP*COMP model is 0.3 miles for the worst-case scenario.  This represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst-case weather conditions) could pose a hazard to the public.  \r\n\r\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThere are many safety programs in place at Conemaugh station to minimize the potential for the accidental releases of ammonia considered by this plan.  For example:\r\n\r\n- The ammonia storage tanks are registered pressure vessels that are built to exacting standards.\r\n\r\n- Ammonia tank trucks are only unloaded during daylight hours on weekdays.\r\n\r\n- The ammonia storage tank is administratively controlled to 90% of its full capacity.\r\n\r\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\n\r\nNo accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 have occurred during the"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event that an accidental release of ammonia would occur, the station has prepared a detailed written emergency response plan.  This plan has been in place for many years, and yearly drills are held to test the plan under simulated conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \r\n\r\nAll station safety programs, including the emergency response program, are reviewed periodically for improvement opportunities."
