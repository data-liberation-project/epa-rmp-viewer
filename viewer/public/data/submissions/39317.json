Public notification can be handled through local television, radio, and mobile public address systems. In the event of an actual chlorine release (worst case scenario, 4000 pounds in ten minutes)  at the Weatherford Wastewater treatment  facility the operator in charge will call 911 and  inform the dispatcher of the chemical release.  Noting  the severity of the release  and the anticipated amount, the wind direction and request notification of all emergency responders listed in the Custer County  Emergency Plan. \n\nIn the typical release scenario  prescribed by the USEPA the affected area will three miles down wind  from the  release.  If the wind were from the South the entire City of Weatherford  may have to be evacuated for a short time.  The major high occupancy  facilities to be notified would include:\n\nSouthwestern Memorial Hospital at 580-772-5551  (the hospital can shut off all air intakes to minimize chemicals entering this facility.)\n\nLittlebird Nursing Center at  580-772-3993            \n\nWal Mart at 580-772-1408\n\nUnited Supermarkets at  580-772-3982\n\nWeatherford Public Schools at 580-772-3327\n\nSouthwestern Oklahoma State University at 580-772-6611\n\nThe Weatherford Shopping Center  at 580-772-5661\n\nIf the wind were from any other direction a house by house  notification would be necessary because of the sparse population. \n\nThe operator in charge would, upon completion of notification of the release, proceed to perform or oversee the installation of the emergency kit on the chlorine tank to contain as much chemical as possible. All persons in the immediate area of the release shall use all the personal protective gear available while installing the emergency kit\n\nWhen the release is contained notification of authorities is to be performed. \n\nThe National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802\nThe Oklahoma Emergency Response Commission at 405-521-2481\nThe local response center will have already been notified by the 911 operator.\n\nThe verbal information that should be included in this report is as follows:\n\nCompany name;\n\nName of caller;\n\nChemical released ( mention that  it is chlorine and that it is on the Extremely Hazardous List);   \n\nDate and time,  and duration  of release;\n\nEstimate of the amount of chlorine released;\n\nInformation as to weather the release has stopped or continues;\n\nThe medium into which the release occurred, (air, land or water);\n\nAny known or anticipated  acute or chronic health risk associated  with the emergency and, where appropriate advice regarding medical attention for exposed individuals. ( Health Hazard Data and First Aid information from the Current chlorine Material Safety Data Sheet may be utilized;\n\nProper precautions to take as a result of the release, including evacuation; \n\nWind speed, direction; and\n\nName and telephone of person to contact for further information. \n\nIf any agency notified has emergency response capabilities and/or responsibilities, it should be informed of any assistance needed.\n\nA written follow-up emergency notice is required as soon as practical after a reportable release. This document should:\n \nSet forth  and update the verbal information given previously;\n\nDiscuss action taken to respond to and contain the release;\n\nDiscuss any known or anticipated  acute or chronic health risk associated with the release; and\n\nWhere appropriate, give advice regarding medical attention for exposed individuals.\n\nThe Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Custer County  Sheriffs Department, Sinor Emergency Medical Services, Weatherford Police Department and The Weatherford Fire Department will all be coordinated by Weatherford Fire Chief Dean brown who is the  County  Emergency Response Director. Traffic detour plans and evacuation plans  and other emergency plans are in place under the direction of Chief Brown as written in the Custer County Emergency Operations Plan.\n\nIn an alternate release scenario a small amount of chlorine, (more than 10 pounds at a rate of  one pound  per minute) is released and  the controlled  without major incident a report of the release is required to:\n\nNational Response Center at 1-800-424-8802;\nOklahoma Emergency Response Center at 1- 405-521-2481\nCuster County Emergency Response Coordinator.1-580-772-7791\n\nIn a small slow release as described , all chemical would be retained on the plant site and only plant personnel and plant visitors would have the possibility of exposure and 911 could be call for emergency help or treatment if necessary.  All of the appropriate information listed  in the Worst Case Scenario  report should be reported for the Alternate  Release Scenario.\n\nFirst aid for chlorine inhalation victims would include removing the victim to a chlorine free area and elevating the head and trunk 45 to 60 degrees. If breathing has stopped CPR should be administered.  If available humidified oxygen should be administered by qualified personnel. If liquid chlorine has contaminated the skin  or clothing  the clothing should be removed under an emergency shower. The skin  should be flushed with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Thermal burns from exposure to liquid  chlorine can be more damaging to the skin than chemical reactions. A physician  may need to check irritated skin areas. If eyes are exposed to strong concentrations of chlorine they should be flushed with tepid water for at least 15 minutes and if irritation persist check with  physician.",

The chlorine is stored in a restricted, fenced area to prevent vandalism or accidental/incidental contact with the chlorine containers or feed equipment. There are only two of the one ton cylinders on the site at any time and only one of these has the valves uncovered at time except for a very short time.  That exception is at the time the cylinder in use is about empty and the second cylinder is uncovered to attach the feed equipment to allow the automatic switch over to the fresh cylinder to continue feeding chlorine. This in effect protects the environment from the probability of a  of a release of the worst case scenario magnitude.\n\nThere are procedures in place to contain a chlorine release and to warn the public  if necessary  for health and safety  purposes. All emergency procedures are coordinated through Weatherford Police Chief , Byron Cox who is also the Weatherford Emergency Management Coordinator. All Weatherford and Custer  County emergency services are available to Weatherford  upon need. The operator in charge has written policy to follow in the event of  a chemical release. The first of which is to call 911 for notification and assistance and then  to contain the leak.\n\nWeatherford has a two million gallon per day wastewater treatment facility and is required by the Oklahoma  Department of Environmental Quality to chlorinate the waste stream before the water is returned to the environment.  The chlorine is to disinfect the water. This program was initiated on May 1, 1999. At that time the treatment plant had two full one ton chlorine cylinders in stock. This will not normally happen again  because one of the cylinders will be emptied and then another will be delivered, so the likelihood of having  two full cylinders"

      "SummaryText": " is remote. An emergency kit to contain a leak is on hand to minimize any release.\n\nA worst case release scenario would be a complete release of all chemical on site in a ten minute period.  Since there are two of the one ton cylinders on site the assumption for this purpose is that both are full  setting there just waiting to dump into the environment at the rate of 400 pounds per minute. The USEPA has developed a modeling program through the  Clean Air Act to describe the impacted area .  In such a release as described , the impacted area would be three miles long shaped in an oval. With a South wind it is possible that the entire City of Weatherford would be evacuated.  With wind from any other  direction a house by house notification would be sufficient because of the sparse population. The Custer County  Emergency  Response Committee has developed the plans for complete evacuation  of Weatherford and for detouring all traffic around the affected area. If a release occurs the operator in charge will call 911 for notification of emergency personnel and for assistance and then try to contain the leak. After the release is controlled  federal and state emergency agencies must be notified. \n\nIn an alternate release situation a small amount of chlorine leaking at a slow rate would be contained by plant personnel with the emergency kit and no off site effect to residents or businesses. With a release of ten pounds or more the federal and state emergency agencies would need to be notified.\n\nAccidental release prevention is an on going daily practice as all operators observe good operations procedures, such as using fresh lead gaskets when making chlorine connections and protecting the pressurized containers from traffic and direct sun. The chlorine containers are inside chain link fenced area to minimize access by vandals and traffic.\n\nWeatherford has not had a reportable chemical release in the last five years.\n\n\nIn the event of a chemical release the operator in char"

The local authorities have the capabilities to interrupt local broadcast  with emergency messages in order to notify residents, that may have their televisions on , of impending danger and what precautions to take. \n\nThe operators of the wastewater facility have had training with self contained breathing apparatus and the entire maintenance department will be under going  this training as well. Several training aids have been purchased and these will be used in the coming months  to improve and promote chemical safety and awareness. Material from the Chlorine Institute will also be used to conduct training."
