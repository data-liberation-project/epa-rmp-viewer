The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Anhydrous Ammonia Plant Laddonia are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Audrain County LEPC and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an anhydrous ammonia storage facility and sells the regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\n\n\n3.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program for the location consists of following the provisions of:\n\na.    40 CFR Part 68\n\nb.    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111\n\nc.    Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law\n\nd.    CGA G.2.1 - 2014\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nAt approximately 9:00 AM on 4/20/2020, an employee was putting a nitrogen stabilizer into two nurse tanks that are attached to a double running gear. After filling the first tank, he closed the liquid\n\nnurse tank valve on top of the tank and proceeded to fill the second tank. To fill the second tank, a crossover liquid valve needs to be opened on the front of the running gear. Instead of opening the\n\ncrossover valve, the employee mistakenly opened the liquid withdrawal valve on the front of the second tank. Upon opening the valve, some anhydrous ammonia that was in the nurse tank hose,\n\nescaped and the employee immediately closed the valve. The escaping ammonia contacted his upper thigh and he instantly began first aid treatment by applying water to the affected area. \n\n\n\nOther than the incident listed above, there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past fi"

Local responders will be notified\n\n   to control any release.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the condition and operation of the facility and improvements are made where warranted.\n\n\n\n12/18/2020"
