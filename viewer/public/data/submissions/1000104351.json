      "SummaryText": "Facility Description and Operations\nThe Samos Polymers Corporation facility in Stanley, North Carolina, known as Samos Exi, manufactures polyurethane prepolymers that are used by various industries in a multitude of applications. The Stanley, North Carolina facility houses offices, a research and development laboratory, manufacturing activities, and a warehouse for raw materials and finished products.\n\nProduction of the prepolymers is completed in a process that is analogous to cooking from a recipe. For a given batch of product that is being produced, there is a batch card (similar to a recipe) which dictates the raw materials used, the procedures for mixing them together, and how to complete the reaction. Blend tanks (similar to mixing bowls) and reactors (similar to pots and pans) are used in the process. Reactions typically take 2 to 3 hours to complete, and when the reaction is finished, the original raw materials have been polymerized. Polymerization is the same process that causes liquid cake batter to become a solid cake once it is baked. In this case, Samos\u0092s products are only partially polymerized. Final polymerization and the formation of a solid \"dry\" elastomer happens on our customers\u0092 sites only when they mix the product with the appropriate curing agent.\n\nSamos Exi\u0092s production schedule is completed over five 12 hour days. \n\nPreviously the site was operating by DSM Desotech, up until end of 2016 and the RMP was discontinued after production/storage operations were ceased. Current update to the RMP plan involves administrative changes and updated information based on the change of ownership of the facility and subsequent change to operations. \n\nMaterials\n\nSamos Exi employs a variety of organic chemicals in the production of polyurethane prepolymers. General classes of chemicals used include polyols, isocyanates, monomers, catalysts and diluents. \n\nTwo chemicals in use on our site are subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements of 40 CFR 6"

      "SummaryText": "8.130: Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI 100) (CAS Registry Number 584-84-9) and Toluene diisocyanate, mixed isomers (TDI 80/20) (CAS Registry Number 26471-62-5). TDI 100 & 80/20 are listed as toxic liquids. The threshold quantities of TDI 100 and 80/20 for RMP applicability is 10,000 pounds in any single process. Processes that were identified to be subject to RMP based on the quantity of TDI 100 & 80/20 in the process consisting of Storage of the two materials. It is noted that there are no product formulations that require an excess of 10,000 pounds of either TDI to be used to produce a batch of product.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at the site from the regulated processes within the last five years that resulted in either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nSamos Exi has established procedures in case of an emergency at the facility. These procedures assign responsibility for implementing the emergency action plan, assuring safety of onsite workers, notifying the proper authorities, and coordinating any necessary cleanup and/or decontamination activities. The Stanley Fire Department and the Gaston County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been notified of Samos Exi\u0092s emergency response procedures. In the event of a accidental release that has the potential to impact neighbouring properties and the public, they will be notified by Site Management.\n\nAccident Prevention\n\nSamos Exi maintains a database of documents related to the safe storage and handling of TDI 100 & 80/20 and conducts regular site inspections to ensure our operations are carried out safely. Samos Exi has established safe operating procedures that are used to minimize the likelihood of a hazardous material release. Practices are updated or added as necessary to address any newly identified hazards. All workers involved"
