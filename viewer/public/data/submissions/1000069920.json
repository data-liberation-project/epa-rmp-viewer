      "SummaryText": "Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company dba HSM is committed to operating and maintaining its facilities and processes in a safe and responsible manner, which provides safe conditions for Company employees, the surrounding community and the environment. The Conover facility manufactures extruded polyethylene foam products, using isobutane (CAS # 75-28-5). The isobutane inventory is maintained above 10,000 pounds. In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as a release of the entire contents of the bulk isobutane storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The impact of the vapor cloud explosion was evaluated using the ALOHA model and resulted in public receptors within the endpoint radius of 452 yards from the storage tank. If required, the assistance of the Conover fire department will be requested. The facility's Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC, local fire department, and local police department. There have been no accidental releases involving isobutane at this facility which require reporting in the five-year accident per the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42(a)."
