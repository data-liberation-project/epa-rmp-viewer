      "SummaryText": "Cherokee Nitrogen Executive Summary\r\n\r\n1.0\tAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies: Cherokee Nitrogen is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.0\tCherokee Nitrogen Company and Regulated Substances: Our facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes.  Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins.  Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world and commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods. The company is a supplier to the fertilizer, explosives, and commercial industries by manufacturing ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other products.   Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers. We have two regulated substances present at our facility at or above threshold quantities.  These substances include ammonia (anhydrous) and ammonia (conc. 20% or greater).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent), urea, and aqua ammonia.  Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) is contained within the letdown, urea, and ammonium nitrate solutions processes.  Sulfur dioxide was used to treat the outgoing process water prior to discharge from the facility. The sulfur dioxide process was removed from service and upgraded to new technologies incorporating Sodium Bisulfite, which is a non-regulated 68.130 toxic substance. As such, sulfur dioxide is no longer p"

These controls include relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms, emergency back-up power, back-up pumps, excess flow devices, and water cannons.\r\n\r\n4.2\tAmmonia (Conc. 20% or greater): Process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental releases of ammonia.  These controls include relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms, back-up pumps, and excess flow devices.\r\n\r\n5.0\tFive - Year Accident History: Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases of regulated substances from RMP covered processes within our facility during the last five years that resulted in off-site consequences. From an on-site perspective within the last five years, three accidental releases occurred that resulted in on-site injuries requiring medical treatment beyond emergency first aid. The following is a brief summary substantiating the accident history involving materials covered under EPS's RMP Rule during the previous five years.\r\n\r\n5.1\tAmmonia (Anhydrous): During the past five years, Cherokee Nitrogen had one accidental anhydrous ammonia release in 2018 that resulted in an on-site injury requiring medical treatment beyond emergency first aid. No additional off-site or on-site consequences occurred as a result of the event.\r\n\r\n5.2\tAmmonia (Conc. 20% or greater): During the past five years, Cherokee Nitrogen had two accidental ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) releases. One release in 2017 and one release in 2019 resulted in one on-site injury per event requiring medical treatment beyond emergency first aid. No off-site or on-site additional consequences occurred as a result of this event.\r\n\r\n5.3\tAs noted in Section 2.0, sulfur dioxide was removed from the facility. During the pas"

The chlorine water treatment process was removed from service and upgraded to new technologies incorporating a chlorine dioxide reactor process. As such, chlorine is no longer present at or above threshold quantities. Additionally, based on process system design the chlorine dioxide present at the facility is below the threshold quantity of 1,000 lbs. Typically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions:  industrial - grade (83 weight percent) ammonium nitrate solution and a high-pressure solution consisting of 24 to 25 percent ammonia and 69 to 70 percent ammonium nitrate.  The industrial grade ammonium nitrate solution is used in the fertilizer industry and as a primary building block for commercial explosives and blasting agents.  Without this product, the mining of precious metals and gems, coal for power and concrete for construction would be much less safe and much more expensive. As this RMP will illustrate, our accidental release prevention programs and our emergency response planning efforts help us effectively manage any potential hazards posed by these regulated substances.\r\n\r\n3.0\tAccidental Release Prevention Program: Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME codes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\n3.1\tProcess Safety Information: Cherokee Nitrogen maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\n3.2\tProcess Hazard Analysis: Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.
