Company has prepared a Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68. Oshkosh Cold Storage is committed to providing a safe work environment for our employees and to prevent or minimize any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Oshkosh Cold Storage prepared the RMP to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate our commitment to the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia at our facility. \r\n\r\n2.\tThe stationary source and substances handled.\r\nOshkosh Cold Storage. Company is located at 4385 County Road PP, Plymouth, WI. This is a refrigerated storage to store processed cheese manufactured at the other facility. Anhydrous ammonia, a common industrial refrigerant, is maintained in a closed refrigeration system for the purpose of temperature control for meat products processing. \r\n\r\n3.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and prevention steps.\r\nThe refrigeration system incorporates redundant safety controls to prevent and mitigate potential releases. The system is continuously monitored by computer control systems that will shut down components that exceed normal operating limits.  Other safety features of the system include:\r\n\t-Pressure relief valves installed on all pressure vessels\r\n\t-Relief activation alarm systems\r\n\t-Manual emergency shutdown systems\r\n\t-Automated emergency ventilation system\r\n\t-Ammonia detection systems.\r\n\t\r\nAdministrative controls to maintain safe system operation in compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program regulations, include:\r\n-Employee Participation Program\r\n-Process Safety Information\r\n-Process Hazard Analysis\r\n-Operating Procedures\r\n-Training Program\r\n-Contractor Safety Progra"
