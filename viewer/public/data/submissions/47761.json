Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response - Cargill Juice North America requires each of their plants to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an Emergency Action Plan appropriate to operations at the site.                                                                                                                                                                                    B. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled - The Cargill Juice North America (Cargill) plant located in Dade City, Florida includes operations for processing and storage of citrus juices as frozen, concentrated, and ready-to-drink products. This type of production requires refrigerated processing and storage areas to maintain the quality of the finished product.  For this reason, two ammonia refrigeration processes were in operation at the facility to provide cooling in the production and storage areas. Cargill recently shut down one of the refrigeration systems, leaving only one refrigeration system - the Compressor Room -10 system - in operation.  The CR-10 refrigeration system charge is 25,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.                                                                                                                                                                         C. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program - The Cargill Dade City Plant has implemented an accidental release Prevention Program that is equivalent to an OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  The PSM/RMP Prevention Program includes written Operating and Maintenance Procedures,  Safe Work Practices, Process Safety Information, and employee Training.  Cargill conducted a Process Hazards Analysis of the process in 2004.  Cargill also has Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Incident Investigation, and Contractor Safety procedures.  All employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration process are trained"

D. Five Year Accident History - No accidental ammonia releases resulting in significant onsite or offsite consequences have occurred in the past five years.                                                                                                                                              E. Emergency Response Program - The Cargill Dade City Plant has an emergency action and evacuation plan.  The plan includes instructions for notifying the public authorities in the event of an ammonia release, and for calling in the public HAZMAT responders if needed.
