      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Program (RMP) has been developed and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared for use and storage of anhydrous ammonia in the House of Raeford Wallace refrigeration system.  The Risk Management Program and RMP meet and address the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.\nThis Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\nA?The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\nA?The stationary source and regulated substances handled; \nA?The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; \nA?The five-year accident history; \nA?The emergency response program; and\nA?Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release prevention and emergency response all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are to be conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.  \n \nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, House of Raeford Wallace has committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of House of Raeford WallaceA?s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, they are taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the House of Raeford Wallace refrigeration system.  The liquid is fed as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system. "

      "SummaryText": " The ammonia changes state and is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 parts per million.\n\nHouse of Raeford Wallace has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  House of Raeford Wallace will conduct scheduled drills of the emergency response plan.\n\n \nTo address the five year accident history House of Raeford Wallace has not had a reportable ammonia release in the past five years.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, House of Raeford Wallace is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventative Program 3) developed for their facility.  The Preventative Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training  to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process.  Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so that the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\nHouse of Raeford Wallace will incorporate or address any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, incident investigations and program audits.  The flexibility of the program allows House of Raeford Wallace to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing House of Raeford Wallace employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
