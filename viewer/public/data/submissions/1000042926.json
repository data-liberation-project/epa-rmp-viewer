This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (TKI)  policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nTKI owns and operates a facility located in Burley, Idaho.  The facility produces sodium methyldithiocarbamate (metam sodium) solution, a soil fumigant. \n\n\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, TKI identified one listed flammable substance (methylamine) and one toxic regulated substance (carbon disulfide) kept on site above the threshold quantities.  \n\n\n\nMethylamine  is stored in pressurized horizontal steel tanks.  The tanks contain pressure relief valves, but no vents to the atmosphere.  Carbon disulfide is stored in pressurized horizontal steel tanks.  The tanks are located in concrete containment equiped with a water deluge system.  Pressure relief valves protect  the tanks.  In the event of a tank rupture, the carbon disulfide, which is heavier than water, would sink to the bottom of the containment and would be covered with water.  The carbon disulfide could then be recovered back into a tank.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the Burley Facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.  The facility has been awarded Star status under the OSHA VPP program.\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\n\n"

The processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\n\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Hazardous Materials Team (HazMat Teams), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nThe Burley Facility actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\n\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets and Safety Data Sheets (MSDS/SDS).  \n\n\n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise (operators).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

The report includes dates of incident and of investigation, description of incident, factors contributing to the incident, and develops recommendation to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Burley  Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members with at least one person knowledgeable in the audit techniques.  \n\n\n\nThe audit team develops findings in a report that is forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked and documented until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are retained.\n\n \n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at "

      "SummaryText": "the Burley  Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Burley Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Facility has safety features on many units to help with the following:  (1) contain/control a release; (2) quickly detect a release; and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1. Sensors with audible alarms are located at the process area, storage tank areas and railcar unloading.\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1. Pressure relief valves on storage tanks.\n\n2. Key manual valves are chained and padlocked in their critical (open/closed) position.\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems activated by motor failure.\n\n4. High level and high pressure indicates with alarms.\n\n5. Derailers and chock blocks to prevent rail car movement for carbon disulfide and methylamine railcars.\n\n6. Sprinkler System on rail unloading for fire/release control.\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1. Standard operating procedures that control, isolate, and terminate leaks.\n\n2. Personnel trained in emergency procedures.\n\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., escape respirator, self-contained breathing apparatus, and supplied air breathing apparatus),\n\n4. Ventilate contaminated areas.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Burley Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  There have been no incidents involving a release of methylamine or carbon disulfide, which had offsite effects.\n\n\n\nEm"

      "SummaryText": "ergency Procedure Information\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures account for the possibility of a toxic substance being accidentally released, as well as for the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures. The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Facility.  \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Facility is coordinated with the local fire and police.  The Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition, the Facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Facility provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant."
