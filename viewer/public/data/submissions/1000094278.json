      "SummaryText": "1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Kraft Foods North America, Inc. facility in Albany, Minnesota has an excellent record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system.  This is a system that uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Albany facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as with the Albany Fire Department and the MN HAZMAT Duty Officer in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Albany plant produces spray dried cheese products. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311513.\n\n\n\nThe Albany plant has one regulated substances under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the plantA?s refrigeration process. The ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia on site is 9,929 pounds.  Although the regulated substance is below the threshold limits and propane is not subject due to the regulatory act mentioned above Kraft Foods North America, Inc. has elected to comply with the General Duty Clause under 40 CFR 68 for ammonia. \n\n \n\n3.0 Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public if there is a release from the system. Although the alternative release scenario is more probable, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated chemical. Described below are the associated hazards "

      "SummaryText": "and the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nAmmonia \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\n\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1. Irritation of respiratory tract,\n\n2. Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\n\n3. Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n\n\nWorst-case scenario - \n\nUnder Section 68.25(c)(1), a regulated toxic substance such as ammonia, which is normally a gas at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure, shall be considered to be released over a 10 minute period.  The rapid release of the ammonia initially liquefied under pressure from the vessel leads to an airborne mixture of liquid and vapor droplets as a release.  The entire contents are uniformly dispersed over the 10 minute period.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - This scenario is more likely to occur than the worst-case release.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario is an ammonia gas release from the vapor space in a high pressure receiver through a pressure relief valve (PRV). The actuation of the PRV will produce a horizontal jet release.  There is no applicable administrative control or passive mitigation associated with the PRV. Active mitigation of the release is human intervention (PRV is shutdown at 10 minutes from the start of the release).\n\n\n\n4.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific "

      "SummaryText": "Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Albany plant has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 2 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.    EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 2.  Thus, the Albany facilityA?s ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\n\n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n\n\n1. All ammonia piping is on the roof which serves as an excellent safeguard for plant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping inside the occupied rooms.  Also, since most of the pipework is out of the way of people and the machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\n2.  The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n\n\n5.0  Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: January 1997 A? January 2002. According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases, for ammonia or propane, at this facility.  6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Albany facility has developed an emergency response program that notifies plant employees who are divided into various response teams. There are multiple in-plant contacts for an emergency.  Contact information for these individuals is located in the Emergency Response Plan.  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency reponse training as well as a detailed description of the training content.   The plan contains specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire and ammonia emergency.\n\n\n\nAt the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Albany Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emerge"

The Albany Fire Department will be called for fire related emergencies.  \n\n\n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the what-if  PHA completed for ammonia and the A What-if Hazard Review completed for propane, a list of action items were developed and monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished.  For example, in the ammonia system, a leak from condenser fittings, piping, valves or other instrumentation is a potential release scenario.  The following action item was recommended: implement visual inspection program on piping systems.  Recommendations from PHA's are followed through as part of the PSM program.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  Need to post signs in appropriate locations that unauthorized personnel are not permitted in the engine room or the USA areas.\n\n\n\n2.  A hand truck will occasionally enter the engine room to move oil drums.  Proper awareness of hazards is required.  Only authorized personnel should be permitted to do this.\n\n\n\n3.  Production personnel currently enter the engine room to turn evaporators on and off.  These people need to be properly trained and certified in the operation of the ammonia system or this function should only be performed by the refrigeration system operators."
