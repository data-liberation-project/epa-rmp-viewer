The majority of the system is located in the Meat Plant machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the machine room roof and all of the evaporators and process freezers are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n    Scenario Description: Chill Plant - Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel - 14,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  The SLAB modeling program was used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n*  Alternative Release Result Summary\n\n    Scenario Description: A release of ammonia from resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 100 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The SLAB modeling program was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.  This scenario could occur at either plant.  Due to the location of the processes, the consequences of the release are the same.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility including ea"

In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility has been in operation since 1993 (the inception of the Meat Plant).

All recommendations are scheduled to be complete by June 1999.\n\nSession 1 - Chill Plant HAZOP\n\nR01    Ensure that the ammonia sensors are interlocked to activate visual and audible alarms (at the alarm level) at various locations in the facility including at the engine room doors.\n\nR02    Ensure that the engine room has overhead water sprinkler capabilities.\n\nR03    Establish a procedure to replace relief valves every five years or any time one unseats.\n\nR04    Ensure that the bladder unit is protected from external corrosion and is periodically inspected.\n\nR05    Consider supplying ammonia sensors with emergency power.\n\nR06    Follow manufacturer's maintenance recommendations regarding all ammonia equipment including compressors, condensers, evaporators, pumps, and sensors.\n\nR07    Establish a procedure to ensure that all employees are aware of the presence of and the hazards associated with ammonia.\n\nR08    Ensure that eye wash/safety shower stations are accessible to all normal maintenance locations.  This could include portable stations for roof activities.\n\nR09    Ensure that operators are properly trained for use of all appropriate personal protective/safety equipment.\n\nR10    Develop an emergency response plan including evacuation procedures and assembly locations.
