We are located in DeerCreek and have one storage tank with a capacity of 36 ton. The storage tank is located on the west side of our property. This is approximately 1.5 miles form the nearest town.\n\n*Worst Case release\n\nUsing the DDgadis table the maximum release of our anhydrous ammonia storage tank would travel 2 miles. In this 2 mile radius the potential for anhydrous ammonia damage would affect approximately 750 people. In this estimate it would include approximately 200 residents and 550 business and school occupants. The scenario we used for this was a complete release of our storage tank in a 10 minute time period. We also have emergency plans for this case as will be discussed on seperate page.\n\n*Alternative release\n\nUsing the same guidelines as above, our alternative release senario would release approximately 6 ton of anhydrous ammonia in a 2 minute time period. This release would travel approximately.83 miles and affect approximately 150 residents. There would be 1 business of 30 employees and 120 home residents in this range.\n\n*Emergency response plan\n\nOur emergency response plans involves a  group effort between DCM employess and DeerCreek and Morton fire departments. DCM's prime roll is in evacuation and calling proper response teams. In the case of an emergency all employess are to meet at the south end of the drive. If the emergency requires emergency evacuation all employees are to meet at the airstrip on DeeMack road. Two employess are designated to closing roads and notifying residents. The secretary is incharge of calling the local response teams and schools. The manager is to access and determine if any more action is deamed nessasary. All anhydrous incidents are at top emergency. With being rated at this, all employes are to use proper medical equipment located in a marked place. In these kit are the following: gas mask,"

      "SummaryText": " respirator canistors, rupper gloves, aprons, and spare breathing apparatus. The local response team is aware of emergency equipment and location.\n\n*Prevention\n\nAll employess excluding secretary are trained in safety while handling anhydrous ammonia, These training courses are offered to employess on a yearly basis. These trainings are sponsored by the Illinois Fertilizer Chemical Association and the Department of Agriculture. Training classes include proper maitenance, loading and unloading procedures, and laws and regulations.\nOur plant also receive bi-annual inspection from the Department of Agriculture inspectors. These inspectors check running gears, hoses, valves, pressure gauges, and relief valves. If any infragments are found, a notice to repair is given. The inspectors will then come back to make sure all proper repairs have been done.\n\n*Summary\n\nWe at DCM try everything we can to ensure the safety of all employees, community members, and response members. Annual tours are offered for fire and medical officials along with community members. We at DCM take real pride in our emergency traing and maitenance performed at our operation."
