The Facility Policy\n\n        The owners, management and employees, of AGP Grain Cooperative at Pauline, Nebraska, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.     Facility Information\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and loading out of grain, with the sale of anhydrous ammonia  fertilizer to farmers, as a secondary and seasonal business.\n\n         Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farmers.\n\n         The maximum quanity stored would be 69,400 pounds in a 12,000 gallon storage tank and four 1000 gallon nurse tanks.  The maximum quanity handled would be the unloading of the 12,000 gallon storage tank holding 52,000 pounds.\n\n3.      The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n\n          a.   The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .74 miles.\n\n          b.  The alternative release scenario (the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is.41miles.\n\n4.       The accidental release prevention program.\n\n          The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\",  published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occup"

The Five-year Accident History\n\n            There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6.         The emergency response program.\n\n             a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n             b.  provided state and local authorities, the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n                  information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.         Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n            Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to\n            access the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\n            safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
