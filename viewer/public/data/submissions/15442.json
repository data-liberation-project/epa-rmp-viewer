Water & Sewer Authoritare strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2. We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is chlorine. The use of chlorine is involved only in the disenfection of water.\n\nTHE MAXIMUM INVENTORY AT OUR FACILITY IS 4000.00 lbs.\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Scenario(s) ans The Alternative Release Scenario(s), incluuding administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequences analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA. The following paragraphs provide details of chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from potable water. The scenario involves the release of 2000 lbs of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are also taken into account to calculate the scenario. At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the distance of 4.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 ans Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from a 2000lb cylinder in the potable water process. The scenario involves the release of 600.oo lb of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 30 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are t"

The General Accidental Reiease Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLimestone County Water & Sewer Authority maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is (METHODOLOGY). The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of (time period). Any fidings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safety conduction activities within our covered processes, Limestone Co. Water & Sewer Auth. maintains written operation procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as iniyial startup, normal operations, temporary operations,emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is reguiariy reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nLimestone Co. Water & Sewer Auth. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at lease once every year and more frequently as needed."
