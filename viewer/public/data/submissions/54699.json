Senior management as well as Safety Coordinators administer the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs. These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \n\nTurlock Cold Storage has coordinated emergency response efforts with Stanislaus County. In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Turlock Cold Storage to evacuate employees and to all the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. Facility refrigeration operators will be available for guidance and assisstance.\n\nThe majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room. The system is a closed loop refrigeration system, similar to a residential refrigerator. There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold and freezer storage of food products.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold"

      "SummaryText": ") liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 5 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 135 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 21,061 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n?IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins \"\n?IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n?IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n?IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nThe Turlock Cold Storage ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. Turlock Cold Storage facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the Cal-OSHA regulation. For example, the facility recently completed a Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study on February 24th, 2009.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a "

      "SummaryText": "vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the facility?s accident history revealed that there have been two releases of ammonia within the past five years (February 2004 ? February 2009). One exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds and the other met the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material. Both releases are detailed below.\n\n?January 19, 2009: An engineer was attempting to drain oil. At one point he let go of the spring loaded valve and walked away for approximately 8 to 10 minutes. When he returned the oil was still draining and had overflowed into the sewer drain. This caused an ammonia smell to enter other tenants? offices and work areas through the sewer drain. Approximately 20 pounds of ammonia (5 gallons of oil) was released. The faulty spring loaded valve was replaced and a course on oil draining was held for all engineers. \n\n?February 13, 2009: A 6? x 1? nipple with threads which connects the relief valve to the high pressure receiver broke at the threads due to metal fatigue. 700 gallons of ammonia vapors was released to the atmosphere over the course of five and half hours. Applied Process Cooling Corporation (Apcco) went on top of the high pressure receiver and removed the damaged pipe at the threads and replaced it with a heavier gauge nipple. Apcco then pressurized the tank and checked for leaks, of which none were found. A recommendation was made during this Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation to conduct further corrosion testing throughout the facility to determine if there are any additional areas that may be susceptible to breaking.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n?save lives;\n?minimize and avoid injuries;\n?protect the "

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the Process Safety Management regulations.  \n\nIn the event of a spill, release, near miss, or threatened release involving ammonia, the event will be reported to the supervisor in whose area the incident occurred. The supervisor will in turn report to the Plant Manager and/or Chief Engineer. The Plant Manager and/or Chief Engineer will immediately determine the quantity of the release and, if deemed necessary, notify the appropriate authorities and agencies. They will also determine whether the system requires shut down.\n\nIf evacuation of the facility is necessary, plant personnel will vacate the facility according to evacuation routes outlined in Section15 of the Sierra Pacific Emergency Response Plan and Procedures. Emergency assembly area locations are to the north of the facility, and are discussed in the same section of the Emergency Response Plan and Procedures. The Emergency Response Team and area supervisors are the responsible parties for ensuring all employees are evacuated safely. They are also responsible for ensuring all employees evacuate to the designated rendezvous point.\n\nNotification of evacuation will be provided in the form of an emergency whistle, or \"disaster alarm\". Three (3) short blasts of the disaster alarm, followed by a pause, followed by three more short blasts will signify work area evacuation. The emergency coordinator is responsible for sounding the disaster alarm.\n\nIn the event the emergency coordinator is unavailable, the emergency coordinator alternate will become responsible for sounding the disaster alarm.

Emergency response drills involving all facility personnel are performed on an annual basis. This ensures that employees are familiar with evacuation routes from the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation was conducted on February 24th. The report includes the results from the following two elements: 1) the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and 2) a site inspection. This study was performed to define potential hazards associated with operational deviations of the ammonia system. The study generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Turlock Cold Storage facility located in Turlock, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.
