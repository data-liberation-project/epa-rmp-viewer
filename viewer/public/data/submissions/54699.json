Senior management as well as Safety Coordinators administer the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs. These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \n\nTurlock Cold Storage has coordinated emergency response efforts with Stanislaus County. In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Turlock Cold Storage to evacuate employees and to all the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. Facility refrigeration operators will be available for guidance and assisstance.\n\nThe majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room. The system is a closed loop refrigeration system, similar to a residential refrigerator. There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold and freezer storage of food products.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.

      "SummaryText": ") liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 5 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 135 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 21,061 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\u00bfIIAR Bulletin 107, Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins \n\u00bfIIAR Bulletin 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\u00bfIIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\n\u00bfIIAR, A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\nThe Turlock Cold Storage ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. Turlock Cold Storage facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the Cal-OSHA regulation. For example, the facility recently completed a Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study on February 24th, 2009.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a"

Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the facility\u00bfs accident history revealed that there have been two releases of ammonia within the past five years (February 2004 \u00bf February 2009). One exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds and the other met the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material. Both releases are detailed below.\n\n\u00bfJanuary 19, 2009: An engineer was attempting to drain oil. At one point he let go of the spring loaded valve and walked away for approximately 8 to 10 minutes. When he returned the oil was still draining and had overflowed into the sewer drain. This caused an ammonia smell to enter other tenants\u00bf offices and work areas through the sewer drain. Approximately 20 pounds of ammonia (5 gallons of oil) was released. The faulty spring loaded valve was replaced and a course on oil draining was held for all engineers. \n\n\u00bfFebruary 13, 2009: A 6\u00bf x 1\u00bf nipple with threads which connects the relief valve to the high pressure receiver broke at the threads due to metal fatigue. 700 gallons of ammonia vapors was released to the atmosphere over the course of five and half hours. Applied Process Cooling Corporation (Apcco) went on top of the high pressure receiver and removed the damaged pipe at the threads and replaced it with a heavier gauge nipple. Apcco then pressurized the tank and checked for leaks, of which none were found. A recommendation was made during this Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation to conduct further corrosion testing throughout the facility to determine if there are any additional areas that may be susceptible to breaking.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\u00bfsave lives;\n\u00bfminimize and avoid injuries;\n\u00bfprotect the"

The report includes the results from the following two elements: 1) the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and 2) a site inspection. This study was performed to define potential hazards associated with operational deviations of the ammonia system. The study generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Turlock Cold Storage facility located in Turlock, California.
