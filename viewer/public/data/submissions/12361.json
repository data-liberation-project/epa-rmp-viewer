      "SummaryText": "The Mott's Waste Water Treatment Plant installed an anhydrous ammonia tank in October 1998.  The tank feeds ammonia vapor directly into the lagoon as a nutirent for the micro-organisms.  The tank is 2300 liquid gallons, which gets filled with 1955 gallons at the 85% level.  The 1955 gallons converts to 9970 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This regulation applies to >10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for which we are just below.  The ammonia system consists of a tank, regulator, check valve, and piping.  The tank also has two pressure release valves and overfill protecton.  The tank has been included in our L.E.P.C. plan.\n\nThe off site consequence analysis consists of two anhydrous ammonia scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the owner or operator assumes that maximum quantity is released over a 10 minute period of time.  The alternative scenario is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be a rupture of the anhydrous ammonia tank, releasing the total contents in the ten minute period of time.  This would cause an eliptical cloud traveling down wind to an end point of 1.20 miles.  Within this 1.20 mile radius there are 312 residents, and 3 commercial/industrial locations and a post office.(see section 2)\n\nThe alternate-case would be a pressure release valve on the anhydrous ammonia tank, releasing approximately 1000 pounds of ammonia over the 10 minute period of time.  This would cause a smaller eliptical cloud traveling down wind to an end point of .20 miles.  Within this radius there are 43 residents.(see section 3)\n\nWe have an emergency response plan which is coordinated with the L.E.P.C., and an emergency evacuation plan for the site.  The site Environmental and Safety Manager is also a member of the L.E.P.C.  There have not been any releases on site to date.  All operators which may come in contact with anhydrous ammo"
