(Rinchem) is committed to being a responsible member of the community in which it operates by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Policy dictates that Rinchem personnel continuously identify methods to reduce the risk of handling hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Team Member Handbook, and the mission statement, which are available to all employees. The Safety and Health policy states:\n\nSAFETY FIRST is more than a slogan at Rinchem...it is a way of life. Rinchem Company, Inc., is committed to providing a safe working environment for its staff members, its customers and the public, and maintains that \n\n\"NO JOB IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR STAFF MEMBERS, OUR COMMUNITIES, AND THE ENVIRONMENT\". \n\nWe recognize that the responsibilities for safety and health are shared: \n\n?    Management, in particular the Director of Quality, ES&H, accepts the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions. \n\n?    Managers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring processes are documented which reinforce safety as well as the use of engineering controls as the preferred method of promoting safety and eliminating unsafe conditions. \n\n?    Staff members are responsible for cooperation with all aspects of the safety and health program including compliance with all rules, documented procedures, and regulations and for continuously practicing safety while performing their duties. \n\n?    Staff members are responsible for stopping activities that may lead to injuries to themsel"

However, safety requires the participation of everyone...only you can make safety a reality. Be alert for conditions which appear unsafe. Report unsafe conditions immediately.Report any accident, \"near miss\", exposure, incident, spill or release.\n\n1.2.    A Description of the Chandler, AZ Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n1.2.1.    Description of the Chandler, AZ Facility\n\nThe Chandler, AZ Facility is located at 6888 W. Frye Rd, Chandler, AZ.  The facility provides transportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of pre-packaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Chandler Warehouse include chemicals containing toxic hazards. Ammonium Hydroxide and Hydrochloric acid are the only RMP regulated substances handled at the site. \n\n1.2.2.    Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes \n\nRinchem receives Ammonium Hydroxide and Hydrochloric acid by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard-specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user. The storage location of each material is tracked in an electronic inventory management system. \n\nAfter an order is received, Rinchem ships the (2) above listed chemicals as ordered by the end user. The material "

Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential hazards at the Rinchem Chandler, AZ Warehouse.  Rinchem conducted an offsite consequence analysis, using the EPA's Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA&reg;) in conjunction with the rules specified in 40 CFR 68.25 to estimate the offsite consequence of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) from our warehousing process. The WCS associated with toxic substances in the Chandler, AZ warehouse is a catastrophic failure of the single largest container resulting in a release of the total contents, 55 gallons of Ammonium Hydroxide or Hydrochloric acid (each shown separately). The passive mitigation measures taken into account for this scenario are the limited quantity of any of the two chemicals that can be released due to container and the handling of containers within the building. \n\n\n\n1.4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\". The safeguards shown in Table A-1 include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of chlorine.        \n\n1.5.    The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Ammonium Hydroxide or Hydrochloric acid at the Rinchem Company Inc, Chandler Warehouse. \n\n1.6.    The Emergency Response Program\n\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc. Chandler Warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of Ammonium Hydroxide and/o"
