The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia.  The following topics are addressed in this Executive Summary:\n\n\n\n?    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n?    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n?    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n?    Emergency Response Plan\n\n?    Five Year Accident History\n\n?    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n?    Data Elements\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nMountaire Farms - Siler City is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nMountaire Farms - Siler City's management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles anhydrous ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the processing and cold storage of food products.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condenser Receivers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Mountaire Farms - Siler City ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts routine operations and maintenance, and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs.\n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable codes, which specifically outline requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the process equipment, and automatic shutdown systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers and receiver).  All pressure vessels and Rooftop Air Units are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANNING \n\n\n\nThe Mountaire Farms - Siler City facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan has been developed by Mountaire Farms - Siler City and is included in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP  document which is maintained at the facility. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n?    To save lives.\n\n?    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n?    To protect the environment.\n\n?    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: \n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths"

      "SummaryText": ", injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\" \n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Process Hazard Analysis study on April 23-24, 2018 there have been no releases of ammonia that meet this criteria in the past five years (April 2013 through September 2018). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis (April 23-24, 2018) including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Mountaire Farms - Siler City facility located at 1101 East Third Street in Siler City, North Carolina. The Mountaire Farms - Siler City facility is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMAMRY NOTES\n\n\n\nItems 7.4h,7.8a, 7.8b, 7.9, 7.10a, 7.10b, 7.11a, 7.11b and 7.15 have been intentionally left black. The Mountaire Farms - Siler City facility is a new facility. PSM/RMP Programs have been established for the facility, and dates will be entered when applicable.\n\n\n\n"
