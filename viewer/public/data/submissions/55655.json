A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training regarding the process modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\nThe San Juan Basin Gas Plant conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure before startup of the modified process or unit that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  Another key purpose of the PSSR\u00bfs is to ensure that all personnel have been trained on the modification, including any revisions to the operating procedures or to the safety systems and controls.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that all personnel and supporting systems are operationally ready to operate the newly-modified process or equipment.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction, and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention, Process Safety Management Program, and Risk Management Program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe San Juan Basin Gas Plant has well-established practices and proce"

If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with the plant's Emergency Preparedness and Crisis Management Response Plan.  \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe San Juan Basin Gas Plant, located in San Juan County, New Mexico, is jointly owned by ConocoPhillips and BP, and operated by the ConocoPhillips L48 Department.  The San Juan Basin Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant that recovers hydrocarbon liquids from unprocessed natural gas.  Two natural gas inlet streams (Low Pressure System and High Pressure System) are delivered via pipeline to the plant.  The recovered hydrocarbon liquids are transported via pipeline to fractionation plants for further processing and eventual sales.  After processing, the residue gas from which the hydrocarbon liquids are recovered is delivered to a gas pipeline for eventual sales.  The San Juan Basin Gas Plant operation includes inlet gas separati"

[Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the plant in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity: Ethane-Propane-Butane-Condensate (EPBC) mix, Propane-Butane-Condensate (PBC) mix, condensate, propane, and natural gas.  [Note:  Condensate is exempt from threshold determination provisions of the regulations based on its National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of \n3.] There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe San Juan Basin Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the plant does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure for flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  The EPBC (Ethane-Propane-Butane-Condensate) Mix was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the EPBC in the largest EPBC vessel. Under t"

[Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantaneously released.  We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors.  In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are placed in service, and the San Juan Basin Gas Plant follows a rigorous Mechanical Integrity Program to ensure that all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected, to prevent leakage or failure.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulations require the operator to model a single \"alternative release scenario\" for all regulated flammable substances.  For the San Juan Basin Gas Plant, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a seal failure on a pump, which was assumed to last for five minutes.  \n\nPassive mitigation systems such as leak detection, gas detection, and emergency shutdown systems would enable the plant to isolate and eliminate such a release within that time-frame.  The alternative release scenario has off-site impact, but there is no impact to any receptors (i.e., residential populations, industrial, etc.), as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance, the \"Landview\" program census data, and actual survey data.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe San Juan Basin Gas Plant adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.

The employees and management are also supporting an employee driven Behavioral Based Safety program.  This allows employees and managers the opportunity to audit the safety performance of their peers, and give immediate constructive feedback on safety performances.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe San Juan Basin Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the plant's operations and processes are identified and minimized.  This is a systematic procedure in which each part of the process is systematically examined to identify all of the potential hazards associated with the process, and to ensure that appropriate recommendations are developed and implemented to eliminate or control the potential hazards.\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis procedure utilized at the San Juan Basin Gas Plant is carried out by a team of functional experts from engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety, who work with a PHA Facilitator to identify and evaluate all of the potential hazards that could possibly result in a release of a regulated substance.  The team also evaluates potential mitigation measures and accident prevention measures for each potential process hazard at the facility.  The final part of the procedure requires the team to make specific suggestions for management consideration to address or mitigate each identified hazard.  \n\nThe PHA team's findings and suggestions are provided to plant management for further evaluation and resolution.
