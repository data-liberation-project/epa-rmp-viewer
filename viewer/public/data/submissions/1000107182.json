      "SummaryText": "of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\nA catastrophic release of one completely full 20,000-gallon bulk railcar of 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (2,4-TDI) into the ground has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment.  For safety purposes, railcars of TDI are normally shipped with no less than 6% headspace (average railcar is 92%-94% full).  It is assumed the catastrophic release would release the entire contents of a 100% full railcar. The impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's ALOHA Model.  The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 341 yards for the worse-case release scenario. The impact distance does not impact any off-site receptors.\n    \nThe alternative scenario is not required due to the worst-case scenario not extending beyond the property line.         \n   \nE. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nProcess Safety Information: Although RMP Level 1 FXI, Inc. should complete a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the Hazard Review.

Accidental Release Prevention and Specific Prevention Steps:\nFXI, Inc.is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program.

Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and emergency response personnel.\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\nD. Hazard Assessment:\nThe RMP requires FXI, Inc. to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst-case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\nThe worst-case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nFXI, Inc. is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\nFXI, Inc.is a urethane foam manufacturing facility which produces various type of flexible urethane foam products located in Longview, WA. The facility fabricates some of the urethane foam into various finished products.\nFlexible urethane foam is a product made by combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is 2, 4-Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in two (2) 12,000-gallon TDI Storage Tanks within the tank storage area and delivered via 20,000-gallon railcars.  For safety reasons, the storage tanks are never filled past 85%.  When including this 85% limit, the Maximum TDI on-site is 76,200 gallons (774,954 pounds). This capacity includes the two (2) TDI Storage tanks and the potential three (3) on-site railcars.  Numbers are rounded up in Section 1 for reporting purposes.   \nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is consi"
