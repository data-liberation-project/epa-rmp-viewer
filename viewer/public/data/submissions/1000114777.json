SNWS is the primary potable water supplier in southern Nevada.  Our mission is to \"provide world-class water service in a sustainable, adaptive, and responsible manner to our customers through reliable, cost-effective systems\".  \n\nThe senior management team at SNWA is firmly committed to achieve a safe work place for the employees at our water treatment facilities by protecting their health and wellness while striving to eliminate exposures to highly hazardous chemicals. The goal of the SNWA senior management team is to achieve full compliance with the applicable federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) program, as well as the State of Nevada Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  \n\nOur commitment to total chemical safety is demonstrated through: \n1.) The employment of a full-time chemical engineer at the water treatment plant who is dedicated to evaluate and improve the water treatment processes, \n2.) A process safety engineer is assigned to SNWA to focus on the OSHA PSM, EPA RMP and Nevada CAPP compliance programs, \n3.) Implementing and improving the comprehensive PSM/RMP/CAPP programs to ensure the following are systematically evaluated and implemented: chlorine process design, process modifications, process technology, process hazard analysis, operational and maintenance activities, standard operating procedures and employee training, \n4.)

Practicing an open-door policy where employees are encouraged to discuss any chemical related safety issues with their respective supervisors and managers, \n7.) The SNWA employees remain vigilant in following safe work practices, doing the right thing, and ensuring safety through continuous education and training efforts.  \n\nSNWA has two water treatment facilities with a combined total maximum production capacity of 900 million gallons per day (MGD) potable water. Both are situated in remote locations and away from the densely populated areas of Clark County, Nevada. The AMSWTF is the larger of the two facilities and the only one that uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  Chlorine is an OSHA PSM, EPA RMP and State of Nevada CAPP covered chemical.   \n\nThe SNWA water treatment process starts by pumping raw water from Lake Mead into a contactor building to undergo ozone disinfection where oxygen gas mixture generated ozone on-site which is  diffused, mixed and dissolved into water traveling through the contactor to achieve the desired disinfection.  In the event the ozone generation system is down for maintenance, AMSWTF can use chlorine gas as a back-up disinfectant.  \n\nFollowing ozone disinfection, the ozonated water flows through a channel to the rapid mixers where a coagulant aid is added to combine the waterborne suspended particles.  Water then flows into multiple flocculation basins where the gentle mixing of water and coagulant aid causes the suspended particles to form larger clumps called \"floc\".  \n\nFrom the flocculation basins, water flows to the multi-media filters where the last step of physical polishing takes place.  As water passes through these filters, \"floc\" is trapped and collected, and the filtered water passes through to the storage clearwell.  A corrosi"

The finished water is now ready to be distributed to water users that include City of Boulder City, Clark County, City of Henderson, City of Las Vegas, City of North Las Vegas, and outlying areas.   \n\nLiquid chlorine is stored in trailers and shipped to AMSWTF by truck transport then kept in two enclosed buildings which have equipment to park the trailers and to evaporate the liquid chlorine for use as a disinfectant.  Access to the two chlorine buildings is restricted to SNWS employees, authorized contractors, or escorted visitors. AMSWTF also maintains an onsite meteorological monitoring station. The prevailing winds at AMSWTF are from the south-southwest; towards the Saddle Island cove and Lake Mead area.\n\nThe chlorine facility was designed and constructed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards and complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  \n\nTo ensure chemical safety, a multitude of technological steps have been incorporated into the AMSWTF chlorine system:\n\n1.) The entire process inside the two chlorine buildings is monitored and controlled remotely by operators located in a separate control room, \n2.) Chlorine sensors are located inside the two chlorine buildings to continuously monitor chlorine level, \n3.) The same two buildings are kept under a slight vacuum, i.e., the pressure inside the building is slightly less than the outside ambient pressure; such a set-up minimizes chlorine leaking from inside the building to the outside, \n4.)

Both chlorine buildings have sprinkler systems and fire walls, \n9.) Gaseous chlorine is delivered under vacuum by PVC pipe to different application points such that, in case of a chlorine pipe leak, air is pulled into the pipe rather than chlorine gas released into the environment. \n\nAdministrative controls are also incorporated into the chlorine safety program; specifically, Treatment Division employees and Production Division operators in the control room who work with chlorine:\n\n1.) Are trained in established standard operating procedures (SOP) and management of change (MOC) requirements, \n2.) Have received 24-hour hazardous materials technician training to deal with accidental releases of chlorine, \n3.) Have received annual 8-hour hazardous materials refresher training, \n4.)

Additionally, visitors to AMSWTF are informed of general safety rules and chemical safety at the facility entrance gate by way of the visitor orientation procedure.
