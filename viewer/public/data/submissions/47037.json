This release is estimated at about 10lbs at a rate of .5lbs/min over a period of about 18min. With a release of this size the distance to the toxic endpoint would be .1mi and could affect an estimated residential population of 500. This number is strictly dependant upon the time of day and season the reason for the higher population is the vicinity of a school.\n\n4.\tAccidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nErie Water Works has taken many precautions and all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40CFR part 68. We are also subject to EPCRA section 302 notification requirements.\n\tThe Sommerheim plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards operating parameters and the equipment used and associated with the process.\n\tOur facility conducts on a routine basis comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled to the best of our ability. We maintain a checklist of all equipment and process actions used in our plant. The studies are done with a team of highly qualified and trained personnel with experience and expertise in the process operation and equipment. This study is completed on a regular interval of every 3 years minimum. If there are any reports or problems with the process or the equipment it is addressed in a timely manner.\n\tThe Erie Water Works maintains a written operating procedure at the Sommerheim plant that describes the equipment involved with the process and the modes of operation for this equipment. Included in the operating procedures are startup, shutdown, normal operations, emergency shutdown, and emergency operations.

This training is both in the classroom and by hands on manipulation. The training is monitored and each participant is tested and monitored on their competency and knowledge. This is followed by on the job supervision until they have shown a high competency in their ability to perform the work. The training is performed on a regular basis of every year but at no more than every 3 years.\n\tThe maintenance that is performed at the Sommerheim plant is precisely documented. The process equipment is checked on a routine basis and the equipment is rebuilt on regular maintenance schedule according to the recommendations of the manufacture. This includes any equipment or material that is dependant on type of usage hours or run time of the equipment. Factory-trained personnel that have shown competence in the safe handling and maintenance of the process equipment perform all of the repairs. Some of the checks that are performed on a weekly basis are the following: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping, tubing, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown equipment, controllers, regulators, injectors, pumps and valves. Any deficiencies found in the process or equipment is corrected in a timely manner and with safety in mind.\n\tAny changes that are made either in the process, technology, equipment, or operation are documented and the changes are carried over to the operational procedures.

Being a water treatment facility is evident of our commitment to public safety. We have demonstrated this commitment over the years by developing a relationship with Local Emergency Management. We also demonstrate our commitment by having a program that covers accidental releases in areas such as design, installation, operation, maintenance and employee training associated with the process at our facility.\n\tIf we did experience an accidental leak the highly trained personnel at the facility would be the first responders and have all of the safety equipment and tools needed at hand to stop the release. We also have a very close working relationship with the City of Erie Fire Department and with the Erie County LEPC both of which can provide additional help, response and expertise in case of an unforeseen release.\n\n2.\tRegulated stationary substance at the facility.\n\nWe have one regulated substance that is stored, handled and used at the facility, which is Chlorine and is stored in an enclosure; the amount stored is currently no more than 16000lbs., which is contained in 8 one-ton cylinders.\n\n3.\tWorst Case Scenario and Alternative release.\n\nScenario\u00bfs have been analyzed and both administrative and mitigation controls have been installed or implemented to limit the amount of chlorine that is released and the distance that a release will travel. In order to provide the correct end point distances we have used the RMP COMP software. The following paragraphs detail the two scenarios chosen.\n\n\tWorst Case Scenario involves a catastrophic release of chlorine from a one-ton cylinder. The release involves releasing 2000lbs of chlorine gas into the atmosphere at a rate of 200lbs/min. over 10min. The release of the chlorine at this rate is indicated to be .9mi to the toxic endpoint."
