CF Industries operates world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the central United States and Canada; conducts phosphate mining and manufacturing operations in Central Florida; and distributes plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States. The company also owns 50 percent interests in GrowHow UK Limited, a plant nutrient manufacturer in the United Kingdom; an ammonia facility in The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago; and KEYTRADE AG, a global plant nutrient trading organization headquartered near Zurich, Switzerland. CF Industries routinely posts investor announcements and additional information on the company's website at www.cfindustries.com and encourages those interested in the company to check there frequently. \r\n\r\nIt is the policy of CF Industries to conduct its business and operate its facilities in a manner designed to protect the environment, and the health and safety of its employees.  This protection extends to neighbors of the Terminal.  Additionally, we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations and the Company will promote environmental concern and education among our employees and with the communities in which we operate.  CF Industries is equally committed to protecting the safety and health of its employees, and will take all practical steps to eliminate or reduce the exposure of employees to conditions adversely affecting their safety or health while on the job, and encourages off-the-job employee safety and h"

The commitment to excellence regarding Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) issues is supported in total by Senior Management of CF Industries.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nOne of the Company's distribution facilities is the Peru Terminal, located in Peru.  CF Industries has been a member of the community since 1976.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only RMP-regulated substance at the Peru Terminal.  The Terminal receives ammonia by rail and by barge on the Illinois River, then distributes it into tank trucks.  The Terminal stores anhydrous ammonia in one refrigerated above-ground tank in addition to one pressurized storage tank known as a bullet.  An extensive EHS program assures compliance with applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nCF Industries' anhydrous ammonia is used primarily as a fertilizer.  Ammonia is a source of nitrogen that is essential for plant growth.  It is classified by the Department of Transportation as a non-flammable, compressed gas.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nCF Industries' Layers of Protection\r\nCF Industries has implemented a comprehensive program at its distribution facilities designed to safeguard the environment, its workers and the surrounding communities.  The  layers of protection are the numerous prevention mechanisms implemented at the Company's fertilizer storage facilities to help manage the risks inherent in handling anhydrous ammonia.  The key safety features are listed below.\r\n\r\n.  The facility conducts comprehensive reviews to ensure that hazards associated with CF Industries' processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  These reviews are conducted in accordance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  One of these reviews is"

The review is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated every five years.  Any findings related to the PHA are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\u00b7  Critical operating conditions at the Peru Terminal are monitored through two independent sets of instrumentation.  Pressure and level gauges alert Terminal personnel with alarms and automatic shutdowns.\r\n\u00b7  A flare helps control tank pressure by burning ammonia vapor before it can be released to the atmosphere.  This is performed when the ammonia compressors are unable to maintain the tank pressure.\r\n\u00b7  The ammonia tank system is protected by pressure/vacuum relief valves and compressors which operate automatically.\r\n\u00b7  Emergency shutdown buttons are located throughout the facility.  These buttons can be used by anyone to shutdown the product flows in the event of an emergency.\r\n\u00b7  CF Industries has instituted a comprehensive tank inspection program that requires every tank be inspected at twenty year intervals.  Tanks are emptied and subjected to a series of tests.  This program is designed to identify and correct any tank problems.  A tank outage typically lasts three months and costs the Company $300,000.  Although an inspection is costly in terms of money and distribution logistics, CF Industries believes the safety benefits far outweigh the costs.\r\n\u00b7  Through CF Industries' PSM program, all covered equipment used at the facility undergoes routine performance tests and maintenance.  This PSM program forms the foundation for the RMP prevention program.\r\n\u00b7  The Peru Terminal is staffed around-the-clock.  Thus, operating temperatures and pressures, and other parameters, are monitored 24 hours a day.  Such monitoring allows Terminal personnel to quickly respond to operati"

Each truck is checked for leaks, and surveillance cameras provide operating personnel additional views of truck loading conditions.  Any truck that fails the inspection is not permitted to remove anhydrous ammonia from the facility.\r\n\u00b7  Another essential element of our Layers of Protection is employee training and continuing education.  Every operating person receives extensive Hazardous Materials Safety training with eight hours of refresher training each year.  They also receive documented training covering 38 specific topics.\r\n\u00b7  The Peru facility maintains industrial hygiene and medical programs that meet or exceed standards of good professional practice.\r\n\u00b7  CF Industries also works extensively with the local emergency  and fire responders through simulation training and drills.  The Company believes it is important that first responders are prepared to deal with any emergency on site.\r\n\u00b7  CF Industries routinely carries out highly documented maintenance checks on its process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\r\n\u00b7  CF Industries maintains and enforces formal procedures and policies on environmental protection, safety awareness, facility design and operation, and contractor compliance that, in many cases, go beyond legal and regulatory requirements.

Each facility is assessed for compliance with federal, state and local regulations every year.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nCF Industries has developed Emergency Manuals for all of its distribution facilities, including the Peru Terminal.  Copies of the Peru Emergency Manual are kept at the facility and the Company's corporate headquarters.  Copies are sent to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the State Emergency Response Commission, and the Peru Fire Department.  The Manual includes all aspects of emergency response including personnel roles and responsibilities, lines of authority, communication, pre-emergency planning, emergency recognition and prevention, emergency alerting and response procedures, site evacuation routes, site security, decontamination, emergency response equipment, medical treatment and first aid services, and post-emergency activities and training.  The Manual is reviewed annually with the first responders.  In addition, CF Industries trains its employees annually on the use of this Manual.\r\n\r\nThe Five-Year Accident History \r\nThere has never been a catastrophic failure of a refrigerated storage tank at any of the CF Industries-owned ammonia storage and distribution facilities.  Additionally, CF Industries' Peru Terminal has had no releases in the last five years that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nCF Industries will continue to coordinate information and training with emergency responders.  This information-sharing will occur during face-to-face discussions and emergency response drills.\r\n\r\nCF Industries will continue its long standing policy to host Community Interface Meetings for the first responders, government officials, businesses and neighbors.
