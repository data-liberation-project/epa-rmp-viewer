This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  This program has been prepared pursuant to Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nThis RMP has been prepared for the Boskovich Farms Incorporated facility located at 711 Diaz Avenue, Oxnard, California.  The facility is a produce preparation, storage and distribution facility which operates various ammonia refrigeration systems to cool produce prior to distribution.  Boskovich has approximately 33,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia refrigerant on site in several refrigeration systems including portable HydroVac units, the Hydrocooler, two ice machines, and in the main refrigeration systems for the cooler buildings.\n\nIn July 1993 Boskovich prepared a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan and a Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP).  The documents have been updated periodically as required.  These documents are referenced by this RMP because they contain some of the elements required by the EPA for the RMP\n\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nTo prevent the accidental release of ammonia, Boskovich has developed the following:\n-\tMaintenance and inspection procedures to ensure the equipment is properly maintained and functioning properly\n-\tOperating procedures to ensure that equipment is operated in a maner that minimizes the possibility of an ammonia release.\n-\tEmployee training to ensure that operators know how to properly use the equipment and non-operators are aware of the dangers of ammonia and the necessary steps to take in the event of an amm"

      "SummaryText": "onia release.\n-\tThe facility is secured by fencing around the site and a 24-hour guard to minimize the possibility of a third party damaging equipment or releasing ammonia.\n\nThe programs are contained in the RMP and Binders 1 and 2 of the PSM.\n\nBoskovich has prepared an Emergency Response Plan to respond to ammonia releases.  In general the plan includes:\n-\tA list of safety equipment available at the Boskovich facility.\n \n-\tResponse procedures for minor leaks.\n-\tResponse procedures for major leaks.\n-\tAgency notification procedures.\n-\tEmergency procedures.\n\nA copy of the Emergency Response Plan (ERP) can be found in the RMP, Section 6.  \n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nAs explained above, Boskovich operates various ammonia cooling systems that cool produce prior to storage and shipment.  The systems contain approximately 33,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario is the release of 1,725 pounds of liquid ammonia from one of the ice machine refrigeration accumulators.  This scenario is considered very improbable and would result in offsite impacts.  The Alternate Scenario considers a leaking valve.  This is a scenario that could realistically happen but should not result in offsite consequences.\nIn order to reduce the distance to the toxic endpoint from an accidental release the following administrative controls and mitigation measures are in place at Boskovich:\n-\tSystem operation and emergency response training.\n-\troutine maintenance schedule and procedures.\n-\tWritten operating procedures.\n-\tRelease detection sensors promote early detection of a release\n-\tSecurity personnel who monitor the facility to ensure that no unauthorized  personnel are on site.\n\nDetails regarding the offsite consequence analysis for the worst case and alternative release scenarios can be found in Section 3 of the RMP.\n\n1.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following components are contained in this RMP:\n-\tRegistr"

Boskovich has had two accidental ammonia releases in the past 5 years.\n\n1.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe Emergency Response/Action Plan (ERP) for the Boskovich facility has been prepared and contains information for responding to an ammonia release.  The general emergency response policy for the site when ammonia is released is to:\n-\tDetermine the severity of the release.\n-\tEvacuate non-emergency response personnel to a safe area.\n-       For minor leaks, isolate and fix the leak. \n-\tNotify the appropriate response personnel and authorities.\n\n1.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of this RMP and the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Recommendations from the Hazard Review and Seismic Assessment are expected to be implemented."
