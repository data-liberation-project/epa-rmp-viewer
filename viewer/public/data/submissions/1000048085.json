The RPC-FF ammonia refrigeration system contains approximately 31,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which is liquified under pressure.There are two ammonia refrigeration systems (Main refrigeration system and the #3 system) that are interconnected.\n  \nRPC-FF endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to Associates, customers, and the community by having procedures to provide Associates educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers both on and off the job. RPC-FF's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates or the community to serious hazards.  An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system.  Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike.  The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.   \n\nRPC-FF has developed this program in accordance with OSHA Title 29 CFR 1910.119, USEPA Title 40 CFR Part 68, California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Chapter 4, Subchapter 7, Group 16, Article 109 (Cal/OSHA), and California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 (CalARP).  The program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency action plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, Associate training, etc.).  In addition, Rich Products Corporation has developed \"Rich Products Corporation Standards for Safety Performance\" which outlines the corporate policy for safety policies, safety procedures, and sample programs to be impleme"

RPC-FF has coordinated all emergency response activities with the Fresno Fire Department and the Fresno Fire Department will perform all HAZMAT activities at the facility.
