We follow the federally required process safety management program (29 CFR 1910.119) to prevent anhydrous-ammonia leaks and other refrigeration system accidents. We coordinate our emergency plans with the Plover, WI Fire Department, local police, and Portage county emergency management through an off-site emergency plan, on-site tours, and discussions. Alternative and worst-case release scenarios have been completed for anhydrous ammonia. Contact us if you would like to review or discuss these scenarios. No ammonia leaks or other incidents that are reportable under the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, Five-Year Accident History (40 CFR 68.42) have occurred in the last five years. We are continuously reviewing and upgrading our safety, health, and environmental programs.\n\n\n\nRecent changes reflect a change in reported quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia used in the facilities Refrigeration System. The Management of Change under the facilities PSM program was used to update the change in quantity.\n\n\n\nThe facility recently completed MOC 2017-01 (Management of Change) for decommissioning of ammonia based equipment no longer being utilized (Pellet Mashed Line) & MOC 2017-16 for the purpose of recalculating the maximum quantity of inventory. Based on IRC calculations, and completion of these two MOC's, the facility has a much more accurate inventory of the quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia in it's refrigeration system. The maximum amount of ammonia quantity is calculated at a 50% level of the High Pressure Receivers, which equates to 128,568 lbs. Typical inventory is managed to a level of 38% in the High Pressure Receivers, which equates to 121,206 Lbs. \n\n\n\nThe facility recently opened MOC 2018-07 (Management of Change) for the transition of the Engineering Manager (previous submitter) to a new position inside the company, but at another facility.

So a MOC 2018-14 was opened to ensure the required information was entered and documented correctly in the RMP.\n\n\n\nThe Plover facility has a new Plant Manager, so MOC 2018-20 was opened to document the PSM/RMP on-boarding process of the new Plant Manger as well as document the required changes related to the RMP program.\n\n   "
