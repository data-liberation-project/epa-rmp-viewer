All employees receive yearly training on the safe handling and transfer of ammonia.  Our equipment was inspected by the State Ag Dept.  and we have kept in compliance with all new and current laws.  Our safety record speaks for itself as we have had no accidental releases ot injury to any employees in our 8 years of business at this facility.\n\nWe have planned for and have coordinated with local emergency responders to adequately respond to all accidental releases we perceive may occur from a simple hose break to the release of the entire contents of the single largest tank."
