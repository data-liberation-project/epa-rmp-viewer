      "SummaryText": "The City of Bowling Green is committed to the prevention and response to accidental release of toxic chemicals and agents from  its water and wastewater facilities.\n\nThe purification process of the water requires that chlorine gas be injected into the water for sanitation.  This requires that 1 ton chlorine containers be kept for use and supply at a maximum.  The system will have one container in use at a time with one or two in reserve.\n\nThe City has taken great effort in improvements to emergency preparedness through its local, county and state agencies.  The water and wastewater facilities have emergency operations and chlorine handling procedural manuals in place.   The contracted operator keeps updates and reviews the operations with them on this.  \n\nThe first priority of the City is to provide a safe work place and safe conditions for the environment.  This is one reason the new plant was located approximately 3/4 of a mile east of town from its location downtown. \n\nOverview of the Facility:\nThe water treatment plant was a new facility in 1998 and is located approximately 3/4 of a mile east of town in a rual area.  The plant is a 2 Mgd pulsating clarifying plant whos construction was completed in early 1998. It was constructed so that all chemcal operations such as chlorine is separated from the plant operation by separated rooms with accesses outside the central plant operation.  Containment of a release could be held until adequate response is made to minimize the release of the chemical.  Equipment to alert operators of a release were also incorporated into the design.  As well, manual shut down of equipment is done at the end of each daily shift. \n\nWorst Case Release:\nThe worst case of a release of chlorine gas from the City's water treatment plant would be that if a 2,000 lb cylinder would develop a leak at the rate of 110 pounds per minute for a duration of 10 minutes then escaped from the chemical room to the outside air.  The contaminated area would be"

There are approximately 41 residences then multiplied by 2.5 for the average number of persons per residence.  The population affected zone would be 103 people. \n\nAlternative Release:\nThis would be a leak of chlorine gas at a rate of 1.05 pounds per second for 45 minutes that escaped from the chemcial room to the outside area.  The contamination zone would be 1.0 mile.  This area has four residences located in it at an average of 2.5 people per residence or 10 people for this area.  \n\nThe City will be evaluating different mitigation systems to prevent or contain the worst case scenario from occuring.  Presently the plan has alarms to warn of early leak detection.  The tank's valves are also manually closed at night when system is not in operation .\n\nAccidental release prevention:\nThe City and its contracted operators work with all regulations that require compliance with OSHA, DNR, and EPA.  The system has a gas detection unit installed for early detection of the chlorine gas.  The controls for safety are outlined in various manuals which every operator is made aware of for the transfer of gas from container to the plant system.  They are as follows: Instruction Manual for Chlorinator, Chemical Feeding Equipment, Gas Detection Equipment, Material Safety Data Sheets (PPG), Chlorine Emergency Plan, Plant Operating Plan.  These are a few of the standard operating practices in place for the plant operators. \n\nIf the emergency should occur then there are in place plans for the coordinaton and response to the problem.  The City has in place at the plant an Emergency Operations Plan.  There is also at the present time a revised Emergency Operation Plan being updated which includes this as an occurrence that needs special attention.  This plan is also incorporated into the County's notification of a condit"
