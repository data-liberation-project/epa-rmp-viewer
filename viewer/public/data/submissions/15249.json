Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of agricultural inputs for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 119,000 pounds in the facility's two (2) tanks of 8,000 and 20,000 gallons capacity.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank. The maximum quantity released would be 85,000 pounds, which represents the volume of that tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion of 200 parts per million (ppm) based on the model used is 2.1 miles.\n\nThe alternate case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose with 13,300 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm would be 1.6 miles.\n\nThe facility complies with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship rules and regulations relating to the safe storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, refgerencing ANSI K61.1. The facility was also reviewed for general compliance with OSHA Standard 1910.111.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, nor, to our knowledge, have any accident"
