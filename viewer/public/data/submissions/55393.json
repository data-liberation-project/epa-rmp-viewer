              "Description": "Fulton Market has implemented a Process Safety Management Program under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119.  The objective of this program is to significantly reduce the possibility of an uncontrolled release of ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system.  The elements of this program also correspond with all standards set forth in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and EPA 40 CFR 38 Subpart D, and include consistent, proactive measures toward maintaining the integrity and safe operation of the system.\n\nAll employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system attend initial and refresher training courses focusing on the specific safety and health hazards of anhydrous ammonia, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  \n\nThe mechanical integrity of all system components is maintained by daily inspections and regularly scheduled preventive maintenance by the facility maintenance staff.  \n\nAll employees and contractors are required to strictly adhere to standard operating procedures and safe work practices when operating or performing maintenance work on or in the vicinity of the refrigeration system.  \n\nAutomated engineering controls are incorporated into the refrigeration system, and are designed to provide early warning of incipient danger, or to actually disable the system if a hazardous or potentially hazardous condition develops.   These controls include safety cutout devices, relief valves, and ammonia detection sensors.  The detection sensors are electronically linked to an off-site, 24-hour monitoring system that immediately alerts the staff upon activation so that a decision as to the appropriate level of action or response may be immediately placed into effect.  \n\nFulton Market has implemented a comprehensive Management of Change procedure by which all anticipated modification to plant operations, structure and/or mechanical systems are thoroughly analyzed in regard to any potentially adverse effect they may have on safety of the facility occupants, the surrounding community, and the environment.  \n\nAs an added safety measure, virtually all refrigeration system components are located remotely and in sections of restricted access from the areas of primary activity of the facility.  This significantly reduces the possibility of inadvertent damage to the system components by forklift operations or other external causes.",
