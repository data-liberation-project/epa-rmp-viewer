      "SummaryText": "DUPONT BEAUMONT WORKS RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nAt the DuPont Beaumont Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all our processes in a safe and responsible manner. Our plant adheres to the DuPont Corporate policies, which are summarized as follows:\n       > All Safety and Environmental incidents are preventable\n       > The Goal is Zero - Zero Incidents Period\n       > All employees and contractors are responsible for their safety.\nThe DuPont Corporate policies are embodied in numerous Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) and Engineering Standards, which apply globally.  At the Beaumont Plant, the policies are implemented through the Beaumont SHE manual called \"Safety How\". This manual is available to all site employees via the computer intranet system. Safety How Volume III in particular deals with Process Safety Management systems and requirements and contains the complete Emergency Response Plan for the Beaumont site.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nOur facility is located on Highway 347 between the cities of Beaumont and Nederland, Texas. The DuPont Beaumont site consists of two manufacturing processes: An Acrylonitrile Plant and an Aniline plant. The products from these plants are Acrylonitrile (ACRN), Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN), Acetonitrile Azeotrope and Aniline. The following regulated substances are produced, or used as raw materials, intermediates or additives:\nRegulated Toxics - Anhydrous ammonia, Acyrlonitrile (ACRN), Hydrocyanic acid (HCN), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Chlorine\nRegulated Flammable- Propylene\n\nKEY OFF SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\nWORST CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe worst case release scenario for a toxic chemical is the failure of Hydrocyanic acid tank cars at either the west or east ends of the plant. The maximum capacity of the tank cars are 100,000 lbs, with no mitigation assumed. This release has off site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance. This releas"

Amount released is 298,000 lbs. The entire content is released in 10 minutes and assumed to vaporize and ignite. The release has no off site impact. No mitigation is assumed. There are propylene detectors and water cannons surrounding the storage area and remotely operated shut off valves.\nALTERNATE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\nAnhydrous Ammonia - An Anhydrous Ammonia pipe (3\" diam) ruptures. The release rate is 7680 lbs./min based on RMP-Comp estimation. The release was assumed to last 10 minutes before valves can be closed. The presence of perimeter leak detectors and emergency response was assumed. This release has off site impact as determined using RMP-Comp. \nHydrocyanic Acid - A 2 inch pipe is ruptured. The release rate of 800 lbs./min. is based on DuPont's estimation of HCN evaporation from a pool.  Dupont estimates were used due to the unique properties of HCN boiling pools.  There are HCN sensors located throughout the HCN handling areas, so a leak will be detected and located quickly. The release duration used was 5 minutes due to remote shut-off valves. This scenario has off site impact as determined using the dense vapor dispersion tables.\nAcrylonitrile - A 3 inch line ruptures. The release rate of 16,200 lbs./min was calculated based on RMP-Calc's pipe leak utility. A release duration of 10 minutes was assumed until valves can be closed. No active mitigation was assumed. The vapor release rate was calculated to be 7680 lbs./min based on the evaporation rate from the pool. This scenario has off site impact as determined using RMP-Calc.\nSulfur Dioxide - A storage tank relief valve passes 71 lbs/min of SO2 vapor for 10 minutes with no offsite impacts.\nChlorine - The 1 inch diamet"

The release is detected by operator patrols, the operations area responds in full acid suits with SCBA and repairs the cylinder with a ton container repair kit. No other mitigation was assumed. This release has no off site impact as determined using RMP-Comp.\nAlternate Flammable Release Scenarios\nPropylene - A propylene storage tank BLEVE with offsite impact. This off-site impact is restricted to the Neches River and does not affect any residential areas.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nDuPont Beaumont operations follows the requirements of DuPont Corporate SHE Standard S21A, \"Process Safety Management\". This standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68. Our safety management systems address all the key features of successful prevention programs including:\nDesigning for Safety...\n- A documented process technology system covers hazards of materials, equipment design basis and process design basis.\n- Applicable codes and standards are met or exceeded\n- Materials of construction are selected to provide mechanical integrity\n- Process hazards reviews are conducted at several stages of the design process\n- Quality assurance ensures fabrication according to design specifications and proper assembly\n- Extensive accident prevention and mitigation systems are strategically located.\nOperating Safely...\n- Operators are trained and job qualified.\n- Operators follow approved written procedures.\n- Technical resources are available and utilized as required.\n- The site is fenced and patroled. All visitors are logged in and out at the gate and logged in and out at the areas they visit.\nMaintaining Our Plants\n- Maintenance personnel are trained and qualified.\n- Contractors are trained and qualified.\n- A hot work permit system controls hazards.\n- Safety critical equipment is set up on a periodi"

We have experienced no known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage from a release of any of the regulated chemicals in the last five years.  However, an incident with Hydrocyanic acid occurred in 1999 in which two Dupont employees were exposed to HCN.  These two injuries were classified as Medical Treatment Cases and recorded on the OSA 300 Log.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Beaumont DuPont facility maintains a comprehensive, integrated Emergency Response program that includes a written plan which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. The DuPont facility is a participant in the Beaumont Industrial Park Emergency Response Team. This 70 member plus team is trained to the HAZ-MAT Technician level for chemical response and Advanced Interior and Exterior level for fire fighting. The Emergency Response Team also has members trained and certified as EMTs and Confined Space Rescue technicians. Emergency response plans are current. The Beaumont Industrial Park has an emergency alarm system that consists of in-plant horns and bells. The community is alerted through"

Local emergency responders are notified whenever the site Emergency Response Team is committed to perform actual emergency response operations. The Emergency Response program is coordinated with the local community response plan. Beaumont facility personnel actively participate in the Jefferson County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Sabine Neches Chiefs Association. The Industrial Park excercises its plan annually and also participates in county wide drills staged by the LEPC and other local emergency response organizations. Critiques are held on drills and actual events and the findings are used to improve site plans and procedures. The Beaumont Industrial Park program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n         - Continued focus on \"The Goal is Zero\" for injuries and incidents.\n         -Strive for continuous improvements through use of inherently safer process implementation.\n\n CERTIFICATIONS\nFor all the Beaumont DuPont covered processes the undersigned also certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted in this RMP plan is true, accurate and complete.\n\nJim Ellis\nSite Manager"
