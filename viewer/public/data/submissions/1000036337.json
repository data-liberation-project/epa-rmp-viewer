      "SummaryText": "The City of Stamford, Texas (City) operates the Stamford Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) which is located in Jones County, Texas on the northeast side of the City. The WWTP provides domestic wastewater treatment services to the City of Stamford. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the wastewater treatment plant where up to 4,000-pounds of chlorine (two one-ton cylinders) are stored on-site at any one time. Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Stamford WWTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c)). A Management System overseen by the City's Water/Wastewater Superintendent (Superintendent) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WWTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WWTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WWTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  There is no history of a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, h"

These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58).\n\n\n\nThe Stamford WWTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The Stamford WWTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The Stamford WWTP operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the Stamford WWTP.  The City of Stamford's Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the county-wide Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (?68.90(b)).  \n\n"
