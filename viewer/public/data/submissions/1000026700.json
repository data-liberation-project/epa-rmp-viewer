The facility complies with the NFPA 58-2014 requirements for LP-Gas storage facilities as adopted by the International Fire Code, 2012 Edition that is formally adopted in the State of Virginia. Additionally, the facility complies with applicable federal and local laws with respect to the safe handling of propane. The facility meets the requirements of the codes and laws with its practices and design to ensure there is minimal risk of an accidental release. If an emergency were to occur, procedures are in place to notify the local Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. The terminal is registered with CHEMTREC, an emergency call center that provides information and assistance in the event of an emergency. There is also a 24-hour company emergency number that can assist with coordinating emergency responders and recommend courses of action in emergency scenarios.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  The Milford Terminal Company facility is a wholesale propane distribution terminal for storage and distribution of propane to local propane marketers. The facility's permanent storage consists of twelve 90,000-gallon tanks with associated loading and unloading equipment. Additionally, there are two 120-gallon tank used for other on site purposes such as building heating. Propane (UN 1075) is classified as a flammable gas. Typically, propane is received in rail tank cars that are unloaded at the facility using compressors. If necessary, propane can be offloaded from cargo liners using on-board pumps. Propane is loaded into customer truck transports or bobtail trucks using the facility's pumping and metering equipment.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, is the failure of one"

The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Equation C-1 from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis was used to determine the hazard distance for the worst case scenario for determination of the public receptors. The alternative release scenario, as determined by the Potential Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (PFMEA) a quantitative study of all potential hazards, is a vehicular accident caused by driver error resulting  in breaking a section of pipe, and creating a vapour cloud that ignites after a short time. The team performing the PFMEA consisted of a group of management and engineers with experience in the design, operation, and maintenance of propane facilities.  \n\nAs well, a third party engineering company has conducted a quantitative risk assessment and layer of protection analysis of the worst case and alternative case scenarios. The analyses determined that the location risk for each of the public receptors were acceptable according to the 2008 modified Major Industrial Accidents Council of Canada (MIACC) Guidelines created by the Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering, Process Safety Management Division for risk acceptability criteria.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  The facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule as per 40 CFR Part 68, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state laws adopting NFPA 58-2014.  \n\nFive-year accident history:  The Milford Terminal facility has never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations. \n\nThe emergency response program:  All personnel, drivers, a"

The emergency procedures cover all components of an emergency including facility shutdown, alerting local emergency services, and evacuation. In the event of an emergency, the typical response would be through 911. Terminal personnel or emergency responders may contact CHEMTREC to request information and recommendations for emergency response measures.  The emergency response plans have been coordinated with the fire department; members of the Fire Department have visited the propane facility and have reviewed the safety systems in place. The Fire Department has been given a map showing the public receptors within the hazard distance in the event of an evacuation exercise.  Emergency response equipment is inspected and tested regularly to ensure proper function.  The emergency response procedures are re-evaluated on a regular basis, as well as tested annually.\n\nOperational and process safety systems:  The facility has been designed with failsafe systems and practices to mitigate the severity of any incident involving propane.  These safety systems and practices include:\n\n?    Restricted access: all operations and storage tanks are contained within a fenced compound. Drivers are pre-authorized to access the facility upon completing site specific emergency preparedness training hosted by terminal personnel. Pre-authorized personnel can access the terminal via motorized access gate. The gate will open once personnel enter their Personal Identification Number (PIN) on the keypad at the entrance to the fenced compound or using a FOB.\n\n?

Normally-closed pneumatic valves: these valves are installed in all tank openings and at all product transfer points. These valves remain closed unless a propane transfer operation is being conducted by authorized personnel.\n\n?    Heat sensitive (thermal) devices:  the pneumatic control valves at the tank openings and at loading points are equipped with fuse plugs which will melt if a fire occurs causing the control valves to close automatically, minimizing possible product loss and isolating the tanks and shutting down loading/unloading points.\n\n?    Fire extinguishers: these are located throughout the facility to assist in suppressing a small fire.\n\n?    Hose assemblies with rupture protection: the truck transfer hoses are equipped with an internal spring and closing flapper valves at both ends which will close the hose ends during a hose rupture or pull-away event, to minimize product loss.\n\n?    Hydrocarbon Detectors: these detectors are located near all transfer operations and when excess concentrations of propane are detected they trigger an automatic shutdown of all pumps and compressors, close the pneumatic valves, activate the alarm, and open the motorized gate.\n\n?    Training requirements: terminal operators have several training requirements that they must complete including having a record of training for completing propane specific Certified Employee Training Program (CETP) courses as designated by the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA).
