Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the PHA reports for G1/G3, G2, and CD4. All recommendations for G1 and G3 are closed. At G2, two MOC driven recommendations are pending completion or evaluation. At CD4, one recommendation is still pending completion. This recommendation is around a US Forest Service shooting area nearby, Ormat has submitted plans for remediation and awaiting response from US Forest Service to move forward if possible.  \nIn addition to the implementation of PHA recommendations, in conjunction with ongoing discussions with the CUPA and other planning efforts, Mammoth Complex has implemented, or is planning to implement, several additional process and program improvements to further improve facility safety and operability. Per these discussions and efforts, Mammoth Complex is implementing programs to:\n\u0095\tImprove preventative maintenance and inspection tasks to ensure Recognized And Generally Acceptable Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP) are addressed,\n\u0095\tImplement a new software package (SAP) to enable better maintenance tracking and documentation,\n\u0095\tRevise the Compliance Auditing program to require the use of independent auditors from other Ormat locations,\n\u0095\tImprove tracking and completion of Compliance Audit and PHA Recommendations with the implementation of new tracking tools, and \n\u0095\tImprove the document control system."

With the construction of the CD4 process, Mammoth Complex updated the Federal RMP and CalARP documents in anticipation of  the 2022 process commissioning. The regulated substances managed at the stationary source are the previously mentioned motive fluids, isobutane, normal butane and isopentane. The motive fluid circulates in a closed-loop power cycle, traveling through accumulators, pumps, heat exchangers, turbines, and condensers to produce electricity with turbine-driven generators. The electricity generated by this process is then sold to contracted off-takers. \nThe maximum intended inventory is for the Mammoth Complex is a revised 686,042 pounds of isobutane, a revised 732,213 pounds of normal butane, and a revised 344,071 pounds of isopentane.  These revisions were required for increased volumes with the G2 repower and new assumptions within the calculations for CD4 and G1 after operational optimization and maintenance activities.
