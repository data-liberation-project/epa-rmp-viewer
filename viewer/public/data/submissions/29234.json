Separarted high pressure gas is routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in an 18,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 170 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in 400 barrel bulk atmospheric storage tanks and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks. \n\nThe facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it contains threshold quantities of Butane as NGL and pentane as condensate.The facility is able to contain 93,600 lb of butane and 92,400 lb of pentane.\n\nThe NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nThis facility has two applicable worst case release scenarios.  Scenario # 1 involves an explosion and fire from an NGL release from the single largest NGL vessel.  The total vessel size is 18,000 gallons and yields a distance to the endpoint which is 0.4 miles.  Scenario # 2 involves an explosion and fire from a condensate release from the single largest tank. The total tank volume is 400 barrels and yields a distance to the endpoint which is 0.2 miles. Section 3.1 of this RMP shows the calculations used for each scenario.\n\nAn alternative scenario is not req"

Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this plan and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
