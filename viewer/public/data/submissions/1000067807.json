Delta Baytown has trained emergency response personnel on site for release response. \r\n\r\n1.3\tTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\nThe Delta Baytown facility's primary activities are packaging, warehousing and distribution of chemicals. The regulated substances handled by the facility are listed below.  Delta Baytown receives the regulated substances in bulk tanker trucks, rail cars and iso tanks and transfers them to 55-gallon drums, 275 gallon totes and other smaller containers.  Filled containers are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are always present onsite.  Typical Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are provided for all predicted regulated substances in Appendix A.   \r\n\r\nChemical\tCAS No.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances:\t\r\nCyclohexylamine\t108-91-8\r\nEthylenediamine\t107-15-3\r\nPiperidine\t110-89-4\r\nToluene 2,4 Diisocyanate\t584-84-9\r\nToluene 2,6 Diisocyanate\t91-08-7\r\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\t108-05-4\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances:\t\r\nDimethylamine\t124-40-3\r\nEthylamine\t75-04-7\r\nEthyl Mercaptan\t75-08-1\r\nMethylamine\t74-89-5\r\nIsopropylamine\t75-31-0\r\nTrimethylamine\t75-50-3\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4\tTHE WORST CASE"

      "SummaryText": "RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nDelta Baytown is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Delta Baytown is a Program 3 level facility.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, EPA's RMP*Comp; program was used to evaluate off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp; is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for the regulated chemicals involves the catastrophic failure of the largest vessel containing the regulated substance at the facility and is either a rail car (est. 20,600 gallons) or a tanker truck (est. 6,000 gallons), depending on the regulated chemical, but for conservatism all worst-case scenarios assume catastrophic failure of a rail car.   \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenarios include:\r\nA 3 hose with 1 puncture while filling at 90A\u00b0F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \r\nA 3 hose with 1 puncture while filling at 70A\u00b0F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \r\nA 3 hose separation flange at 90A\u00b0F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \r\nA four drums falling off the loading dock and contents leaking within one minute at 100A\u00b0F.  \r\nA overfilling of a drum at the filler for 1 minute at 90A\u00b0F.  \r\n\r\nNone of these scenarios are likely to result in the full amount of the regulated substances being released because of onsite personnel and other mitigation techniques, but for the worst-case and alternative scenarios these situations were used as potential possibilities that could have offsite consequences, as required by 40 CFR 68.25 and 40 CFR 68.28.\r\n\r\n1.5\tTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nDelta Baytown has taken the necessary steps to comply wi"

The packaging and warehouse process at the facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Delta Baytown is subject to EPCRA Section 313 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.  Each of these elements are discussed in more detail later in this RMP.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information  \r\nDelta Baytown maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis \r\nThis facility conducts process hazard analysis to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. The checklist and what if methods are used to carry out the process hazard analyses. The process hazard analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revised as needed when there is a change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Delta Baytown maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nDelta Baytown has a training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive training before starting work. Operating procedures are reviewed annually or more frequently as needed. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity \r\nDelta Baytown carries out documented maintenance checks on process"
