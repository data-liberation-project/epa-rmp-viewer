Plant in Auburn, IN, handles toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\nFXI, Inc. is committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  FXI, Inc. has emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and used to produce carpet padding, foam for the automotive industry, and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by rail car and by tank truck, and is stored in indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in rail cars and in storage tanks at our plant is about 1,458,000 pounds.  TDI is unloaded from the top of the rail car to minimize potential spills.  TDI is stored in four 25,381-gallon capacity storage tanks in the tank farm with a"

      "SummaryText": "identify needed process safety improvements, some of which result in changes to the processes.  \nRecent planned changes include in August of 2012 the TDI rail car unloading area perimeter security was improved. Improvements included changes in the procedures that the employee(s) unloading the rail car will first secure the area by closing the large exterior bay door. The bay door will remain closed at all times when there is a rail car containing TDI staged in the rail car docking area. The two access paths to the rail dock unloading area that approach from inside the plant are cordoned off with chain. Signs are posted that TDI unloading is underway. This procedure serves to heighten awareness of all employees and restrict pedestrian traffic in the area to authorized personnel only. \n\nA second update to the TDI systems safety and employee safety is the installation of continuous TDI monitoring devices in two keys areas. The key areas are the pour line bridge next to the TDI incoming transfer line and over top of the bulk storage tanks. Although there has not been TDI release at this facility, the potential is there for a leak and harm to employees. The technology allows for instant warning as it is set to alarm at very low TDI concentration of less than 4 ppb. Employees have received training that includes steps to take should the TDI alarm sound. Steps include evacuation of the area and the activation of the in house HAZWOPER response team.  OSHA\u2019s PEL Ceiling Limit is 20 ppb. \n\nAlso in 2013 the plant leadership team embraced the EPA's National Emphasis Program for potential for worker exposure through inhalation and dermal absorption. Extensive swipe testing was conducted for laboratory workers as well as all employees that handle or work around TDI. This swipe testing is repeated periodically in order to maintain awareness of the potential for this type of exposure and to detect any surface contamination. \n\nIndustrial Hygiene surveys and periodic vapor testing ar"

Our program consists of procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and or trained on those changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  The plant also conducts periodic tours that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. Historically the facility participates in county wide disaster drills when available. \n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nFXI, Inc. strive to continuously improve the safety of our plant TDI process through periodic safety reviews and a program of soliciting safety suggestions from employees.  Our hazard review and incident investigation programs are especially designed to"

As extra safety measures, the facility may choose to follow some Level 2 items. \n The TDI process at our plant has hazards that are carefully managed to ensure continued safe operation.  A prevention program is applied to the TDI process.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors, and by management system failures.\n  In addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\n \n Release Detection \n- High level alarms\n \n Release Containment/Control\n- TDI storage tanks are piped to overflow to other vessels\n- Curbing or dikes to contain TDI liquid releases\n- TDI storage tanks located inside an enclosed building\n- Pressure/vacuum relief devices on vessels to prevent rupture or collapse\n- Remote shutdown of unloading and transfer pumps\n- Magnetic drive TDI centrifugal pumps without seals\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process\n- TDI rail car inner tank is surrounded by an outer shell filled with insulation\n- TDI rail cars are top unloaded through a nozzle in the top of the tank\n- Rupture disc to prevent over pressurization of piping\n- TDI railcars are unloaded inside\n \n Release Mitigation\n- Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n- Trained emergency response personnel\n- Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, breathing air stations)\n\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nThe facility has had no releases of TDI in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site"

      "SummaryText": "r at the plant.  The TDI vendors limit the quantity of TDI loaded into a rail car to 162,000 lbs. maximum (95% max fill) to allow space for thermal expansion during possible heating of the TDI.  In efforts to be as conservative as possible, the scenario assumed a railcar 100% full.  During cold weather, the facility pre-heats the TDI to a maximum temperature of 95\u00b0F to facilitate unloading and prevent TDI solidification.  During hot weather, the TDI temperature could reach the maximum ambient temperature of 100\u00b0F.  As an extra safety factor, the scenario utilized an even greater puddle temperature of 110\u00b0F because a release at a higher temperature will result in the greatest endpoint distance.  The air temperature was set to 96\u00b0F (highest temperature over a 3-year period) with a stability class of F and wind at 1.5 meters/second at 10 meters.  The scenario also assumed that the entire contents of the rail car would be released as a liquid, form a pool that would spread to cover an area of approximately 81,492-ft2 with a depth of 1 cm with zero soil absorption, and evaporate to form a vapor cloud that would disperse downwind.  Refined ALOHA dispersion modeling predicts a distance of 189 yards (567 feet) from the rail car to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm (0.007 mg/L).    Zero receptors were impacted according to the air dispersion modeling.  Figures used followed EPA\u2019s RMP Guidance documents and 40 CFR Section 68.22 and 68.25.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Level 1 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 1 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI cannot impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, and (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA's process safety management standard (PSM), and (3) The facility has not had any injuries that wou"

In March 2007 a TDI Doper System was installed in the TDI process.  The Doper System involves pumping TDI into a Tank filled with nitrogen gas.  The TDI absorbs some of the nitrogen.  This TDI is then pumped to the mix head to produce flexible polyurethane foam.\nIn the past, TDI was also mixed with other chemicals to create binder. This process is no longer used at the facility and associated equipment has been removed. \nTDI is the only substance handled at the facility that is regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule.  TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored onsite exceeds the EPA threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating worst case release scenarios (WRSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs) where required.  It is not expected that a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  \nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\n\nMost people at the endpoint distance of a TDI release would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\n\nWorst case release scenario:  Catastrophic failure of an incoming TDI rail car, having a capacity of 20,000 gallons.
