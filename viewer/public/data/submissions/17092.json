Its two water filtration plants, drawing from the Potomac and Patuxent rivers, produce an average of 166 million gallons of pure water per day, and over 5,000 miles of water mains deliver that product to homes and businesses in Prince Georges and Montgomery Counties.  The Commission operates three reservoirs, with a total capacity of 14 billion gallons, to ensure a reliable water supply for all seasons and conditions.\n    \nIV.    POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES \n\n    A six-member commission governs WSSC--three members from each county.  The Commissioners are appointed to four-year terms by their respective county executives, and confirmed by their county councils.\n    The Commissions powers and responsibilities are set forth in State law and in subsequent legislative amendments.  The Maryland General Assembly conferred these powers upon the WSSC to enable it to fulfill its principal functions.\n\n    The Commissions major functions are to:\n\n-    provide for the construction, operation, and maintenance of water supply and sanitary sewerage systems in Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties,\n\n-    approve the locations of, and issue permits for, utilities installed in public ways, and \n\n-    establish water consumption rates, sewer usage rates, connection charges, front foot benefit charges, and permit fees, and if required, cause ad valorem taxes to be  levied.\n\n    The Commission also:\n\n-    reviews preliminary subdivision plats as to suitability of water and sewer design, and reviews street grades for those streets in which there are Commission facilities,\n\n-    formulates regulations, issues permits for, and inspects all plumbing and gas-fitting installations, and\n\n-    conducts examinations for master and journeyman plumbers and gas fitters, and issues licenses to those qualified to perform plumbing and gas-fitting work.\n\nV.

It is the smaller of the Commissions two water treatment plants and is designed to provide approximately 72 million gallons of water per day (mgd) to the distribution system. However, with future renovations to upgrade the plant it is expected that the plant will deliver an average plant flow of 60 mgd during the renovation. \n\n   The plant operates 24 hours a day with a minimum of two operators on every shift.

The plant personnel are also responsible for Rocky Gorge Pumping Station, the Pretreatment Facility, the Sludge/Reclaim Pumping Station, the Patuxent Finished Water Pumping Station, and Duckett Dam.  \n\nThe Potomac and Patuxent WFPs have consistently processed water well within the maximum contaminant level (MCL) limits as established by the EPA - Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).

The plant has successfully operated several years without a lost time accident over the past decade. \n\n    The plant is designed to provide reliable operations year-round.  Power to the plant originates from two different electrical sources, providing electrical redundancy, thereby reducing the potential occurrence of a total power outage.    The plant is designed with redundant equipment at every phase of the treatment process.  Thus, when an equipment failure occurs, the process can continue producing a high quality final effluent and providing maximum protection to our environment.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Commission accidental release prevention program is part of the agencys overall Safety & Health Program and involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to ensure our workers and the public a safe environment.
