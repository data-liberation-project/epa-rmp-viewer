It is our intent not only to comply with the mandatory parts of these safety regulations, but also with the spirit of them.  We have designed this PSM/RMP program to control and reduce the risk of injury, death, environmental damage, or property damage as well as being a teaching aid for employees to learn how their job is an integral part of the PSM/RMP process.  The program protects employees, contractors and the public.  We are committed to its purpose.  We ask all employees and contractors to perform to the spirit and requirements of this program by learning how your job is an integral part of the PSM/RMP program, by performing your work to the PSM/RMP Program requirements, and by making suggestions to improve the Program.\n\n\n\nThe Cope Station Power Plant is located at 405 Teamwork Road Cope, South Carolina in the County of Orangeburg.  The power plant generates 430 megawatts of electricity from pulverized coal.\n\n\n\nThe Cope Station Power Plant is currently in the process of installing a SCR de-Nox system to lower its Nox emissions.  The SCR process utilizes anhydrous ammonia to react with the NOx compounds producing nitrogen and water.  The requirement for the addition of anhydrous ammonia necessitates the storage of large quantities of ammonia.  The RMP program is initiated when a facility stores 10,000 lb. or more of anhydrous ammonia, which the Cope Station Power Plant will be doing.  The Cope Station Power Plant is rated a Program 3 facility.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia will be stored in two tanks each with a capacity of 30,000 gallons.  Administrative procedures will limit each tank to a maximum of 25,500 gallons or 85% of tank capacity.  The two storage tanks will be located inside a concrete secondary containment dike to limit the spread of liquid ammonia in case of a tank rupture.  The liquid ammonia will be delivered to the"

The result of this scenario was modeled using RMPCOMP version 1.07 and Landview 5 to determine the offsite impact. In the analysis administrative controls (written procedures) and high level alarms will limit the maximum volume of stored anhydrous ammonia to 25.500 gallons.  Additionally the tanks are located inside a concrete secondary containment dike, which limits the release rate to 12,100 lb/minute.  The model was run using a rural surrounding.\n\n\n\nThe Cope Station Power Plant complies with the regulations of OSHA 1910.119 (PSM Regulations) and 40 CFR 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions Regulations - RMP).  The facility has an emergency response team on site.  As part of complying with the above regulations an Emergency Response Plan will be developed in compliance with the regulations.  Many of the components of the plan currently exist as company operating procedures.  As part of the requirement for the RMP the following areas of concern will addressed and implemented or updated as appropriate:\n\n\n\n* Process Safety Information\n\n* Employee Involvement\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n\n* Operating Procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Contractors\n\n* Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n* Mechanical Integrity\n\n* Hot Work\n\n* Management of Change\n\n* Incident Investigation\n\n* Emergency Planning and Response\n\n* Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nThis is a new installation that is scheduled to start in August, 2008.  Since the facility does not currrently use or store anhydrous ammonia on site there have not been any release of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan provides the contact name and phone number of the Orangeburg County Emergency Management department (LEPC) as well as the phone numbers of the local fire department, hospital, police station and a hazardous waste response company to assist the company emergency response team on an as needed basis"

Prior to start-up of the system all employees will have received the appropriate training and all equipment will have been checked for proper operation.  The emergency response team will have been trained in the proper response techniques for an anhydrous ammonia spill.  A Process Hazard Analysis has been completed on the new system and the resulting recommendations incorporated into the design and operating procedures of the system."
