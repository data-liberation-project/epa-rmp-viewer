The Facility Policy\n      The owners, management, and employees of Agricultural Services, Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n2. Facility Information\n       *The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n       *Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop\n        production nutrient.\n       *The maximm quantity stored would be 131,000 # in one tank which is a 30,000 gal. \n        vessel. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi truck with the \n        capacity of approximately 42,000 #.\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n       *The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a \n         30,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity\n         released would be 131,000 pounds, which represents the volume the 30,000 gal.\n         storage tank at 85% capacity as  limited by design standards. The distance to the \n         endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.40 miles.\n        *The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release\n         from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to .\n         200 ppm) is 0.7 miles.\n4. The accidental release prevention pogram\n         *The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage\n           and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National\n           Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and  \n           Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910. 111, \"Storage and hand"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five \n               years that:\n               *have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;\n               *nor, to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, \n                sheltering in place, property damage, or enviromental damage, with the \n                following exception.\n          B. The following is a list of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past \n               five years that have occured at the facility and meet the above criteria:\n                  *Valve opened due to hot day and cool night\n6. The emergency response program\n                 * The facility has:\n                 a.A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 \n                    DFR 1910.38;\n                 b.Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community \n                    right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n                 c.A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA \n                    standard 29, DFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and \n                    and employee training.\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n                   * Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic\n                      evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.\n                      There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety \n                      recommendations for implementaion at this time.\nFor further information, contact: Terry Gorecki      Manager         2-17-99"
