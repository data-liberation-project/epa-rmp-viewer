      "SummaryText": "rocedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center plays an active roll in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impacts of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues. Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nEli Lilly produces a variety of pharmaceutical products using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. The Lilly LTC Site, which is comprised of 225 acres, is bound by Morris Street on the North, Harding Street on the West and Raymond Street on the South.  LTC North was originally opened in 1946 and LTC South in 1968.

      "SummaryText": "THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO:\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Chlorine \n\nLilly uses chlorine to feed a caustic scrubber system for the insulin process. The worst case scenario is a puncture hole that releases the entire cylinder as a gas in 10 minutes.. According to the EPA RMP Comp and EPA's standard weather conditions, the distance to the toxic end point is 1.3 miles. Approximately 1,775 residents may be affected by this release. The Site emergency response team has trained on the mitigation of this scenario with the use of a chlorine B kit.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Chlorine\n\nThis scenario is similar to our worst case scenario and assumes a one ton chlorine cylinder with a release time of 18 minutes. According to the CHARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) model using typical weather conditions for Indianapolis, the distance to the toxic end point is 1.6 miles. Approximately 2200 residents may be affected by this release. The Site emergency response team has trained on the mitigation of this scenario with the use of a chlorine B kit. In most cases other than during the storage and handling of the cylinder, the chlorine is stored in an enclosed building designed to scrub and contain the chlorine from releasing to the environment.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nLilly uses anhydrous ammonia in the insulin fermentation process. The scenario assumes a valve"

According to the CHARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) model using typical weather conditions for Indianapolis, the distance to the toxic end point is 1.0 mile. Approximately 1700 residents may be affected by this release. The Site emergency response team has trained on the mitigation of this scenario. In determining worse case offsite impacts, the RMP regulations assume that all safety systems must fail. In reality our restricted flow valves and the water deluge system for both the ammonia tank and the delivery truck should keep ammonia from going offsite.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nLilly LTC has no flammable chemicals that meet the regulatory criteria.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nLilly LTC has no flammable chemicals that meet the regulatory criteria.\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: \n\nThe Lilly Technology Center is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements, as well as other OSHA requirements.  The facility is also subject to regulation by other agencies, including the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. \n\nSpecific prevention programs include conducting pre-startup and design hazard assessments, proactive maintenance programs, routine vessel inspections, emergency response training, safe to work programs, employee and contractor safety programs, and accident investigation programs.\n\nAs a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), Lilly participates in a program known as Responsible Care . . The purpose of Responsible Care . is to commit companies to performance improvement in health, safety, and environmental quality.
