We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the environment. \n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Louisville Packaging site blends and packages a variety of refrigerant gases. In our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\n\n\nChemical---use of substance\n\n\n\nDifluoroethane---Blending Operation\n\nN-Butane/ ISOpentane---Blending Operation\n\nPropane---Blending Operation and packaging\n\nISO-Butane---Blending Operation and packaging\n\n\n\nNOTE: N-Butane will be received in a trailer containing a mix between N-Butane and ISO- Pentane. N-Butane makes up around 76% which is about 30,000 lbs. ISO-Pentane makes up around 24% which is close to the threshhold of 10,000 LBs. Even though the site currently does not exceed the threshold of 10,000 lbs for ISOpentane we included it in our RMP as a precautionary measure because it is very close to the threshold. Also, both N-Butane and ISO pentane come together as a mix, so when we used the RMP COMP we included both chemicals for both the worst case scenarios and the alternate release scenarios. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur company maintains a number of accident prevention programs, which implement specific prevention steps in order to ensure safe operation of all processes. The accident prevention programs in place are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. \n\n\n\nAs par"
