      "SummaryText": "SuperValu Inc.'s (SuperValu) Pittsburgh Division New Stanton, PA Distribution Center (DC) is a wholesale food distribution facility serving retail stores throughout Pennsylvania.  SuperValu's New Stanton Distribution Center is located a 4000 Paintersville Road in New Stanton,  In employs approximately 860 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management (RMP) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and OSHA Regulation under 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM).  To date SuperValu's New Stanton DC has not experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected employees, residents or the environment.   \n\n   \n\nPursuant to RMP/PSM regulations, SuperValu has developed a comprehensive PSM/RMP written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals located on site. The facility completed an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and subsequent 5 Year PHA Revalidations for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA's were completed using technical and operations staff from the facility as well as ammonia refrigeration contractors and Corporate Personnel. \n\n\n\nSuperValu's implementation of the PSM Program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors "

Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.\n\n\n\nSuperValu is committed to minimizing accidental releases from the refrigeration process at the New Stanton DC.  Facility Management is involved in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. SuperValu's employees are involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management is committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at SuperValu should be address to Ted Busko Facility Manager at the New Stanton DC and/or SuperValu's Environmental Affairs Department (Dale Patton)\n\n"
