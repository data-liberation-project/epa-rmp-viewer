Because Honeybear has chosen not to respond to large releases of ammonia, the Emergency Response plan instructs employees to report any evidence of ammonia release to their supervisor.  Supervisors will relay this information to the Emergency Response Coordinator and the Evacuation Coordinator will determine if evacuation is necessary and call 911.  Employees will evacuate to the appropriate Assembly Area and wait for instructions from Coordinator.  Upon arrival of Fire Department personnel, they will take control of the emergency procedures and Honeybear employees will take direction from them.\r\n\r\nThere are other hazardous substances used on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.\r\n\r\nThe plant has not sustained any accidents involving ammonia in the last five years, to the knowledge of new owners.\r\n\r\nTraining on ammonia safety and detailed mechanical integrity will be a major ongoing process at Honeybear Growers.  Review and update of the Emergency Plan will be done annually.  Drills and emergency evacuation practices will be executed annually.  Standard Operating Procedures have been developed and are strictly followed by employees. Training on ammonia safety will be required for all employees who work around the ammonia system, including forklift drivers.\r\n\r\nThe facility is bordered by mature orchards on all sides, with some commercial facilities to the east.  The Columbia River is close by on the south side of the facility.  This portion of the river is controlled by St Joseph's Dam above the facility and Well's Dam below.  The huge amount of water flowing past the facility would quickly dilute and absorb any release of ammonia in it's direction.  Since anhydrous ammonia is a naturally occuring chemical and the river's huge amount of water"

Management will comply with OSHA and WA State process safety management rules and regulations, WA state safety regulations, IIAR standards for good work practices, and EPA's Risk Management Plan regulations.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used on-site in a closed system as a refrigerant.  Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance List.  There is approximately 15,700 pounds of ammonia in the plant.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling in order to:\r\n   * Prevent unnecessary human exposure\r\n   * Reduce the threat to personnel\r\n   * Reduce the threat to the community\r\n   * Reduce the threat to the environment\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation, including the recent expansion completed in 2017.  Before these additions were made to the system the amount of ammonia used was below the threshold quantity and did not require RMP reporting.  All piping and equipment are secured and protected, engine room doors are tight fitting and open outward.  Other safety systems include:\r\n   * Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\r\n   * Suction trap hi-level float\r\n   * High discharge pressure shut down\r\n   * Low suction pressure shut down\r\n   * High discharge temperature shut down\r\n   * Oil pressure failure shut down\r\n   * High amperes shut down\r\n   * Automatic timer to prevent short cycling via computer controls\r\n   * Oil filters plugged shut down\r\n   * 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent over-pressure situations\r\n   * 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent over-pressure situations\r\n\r\nHoneybear personnel are not trained or equipped to respond to large relea"
