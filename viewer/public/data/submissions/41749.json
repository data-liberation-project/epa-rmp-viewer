MAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\n\n    The Milton Wastewater Treatment Plant stores four (4) 2,000 lb. or \"one-tons\") of chlorine at the \"Chlorination Building\" or Building 1 located in the Southwest corner of the facility.  There are two (2) one-ton containers on-line during normal operations inside the center room and two containers stored on the outside deck of Building 1. Facing west (toward the river), empty ton containers are stored on the left (South) side of the unloading dock and full ton containers are stored on the right (North) side of this area.\n\n    Also, on this unloading dock at Building 1 there are at a maximum, 4 (four) 150 lb. cylinders or \"150's\" of chlorine.  Full and empty  \"150's\" are stored and chained on the northeast corner of the outside dock.  All storage areas are marked with \"FULL\" or \"EMPTY\" signs.  Approximately 150 feet directly north of this building is a small fiberglass enclosure that may contain a \"150\" on line with full and/or empty cylinders chained and designated with appropriate signs.\n\n    The approximated maximum amount of chlorine on site could collectively total 8,900 lbs.  \n\nC. The safe upper and lower parameters for chlorine are as follows:\n\n\nLIQUID CHLORINE (EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE)\n\n\nCAS #    \n7782-50-5\n\nUSE:    \nWATER DISINFECTION\n\nTOTAL QUANITY ON HAND    \n8,900 LBS.\nSINGLE LARGEST QUANTITY ON HAND      4 - 2,000 LBS CONTAINERS (ONE-TON)\n6 -    150 LBS.

Under certain conditions, liquid chlorine may be cold enough to cause frostbite (even through high quality protective clothing), to fog up protective face masks, or freeze footgear to the ground.\n\n\nReaction with Water\n\nChlorine is only slightly soluble in water, forming a weak solution of hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids.  Chlorine hydrate (cl2-8h2o) may crystallize below 49.3oF (9.6oF) at atmospheric pressure and at higher temperatures at increased pressures.\n\n\nLiquid-Gas Volume Relationship\n\nAt standard conditions the weight of one volume of liquid chlorine equals the weight of 456.5 volumes of chlorine gas.\n\n\nCritical Pressure\n\n1157.0 psia (7977 kPa)-The vapor pressure of liquid chlorine at the critical temperature.\n\nCritical Temperature\n\n290.75oF (143.75oC)-The temperature above which chlorine exists only as a gas no matter how great the pressure.\n\nCritical Volume\n\n0.02795 ft3/lb (0.00174 m3/kg)-The volume of a unit mass of chlorine at the critical pressure and temperature.\n\nReactions with Metals\n\nThe reaction rate of dry chlorine with most metals increases rapidly above a temperature which is characteristic for the metal.  Below 250oF iron, copper, steel, lead, nickel, platinum, silver and tantalum are resistant to dry chlorine gas or liquid.\n\nAt ordinary temperatures dry chlorine reacts (often violently) with aluminum, arsenic, gold, mercury, selenium, tellurium, tin and  titanium.  At certain temperatures sodium and potassium burn in chlorine gas.  Carbon steel ignites at 483oF (251oC) in a chlorine atmosphere.\n\nWet chlorine, primarily because of the hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids formed through hydrolysis, is very corrosive to most common metals.  Platinum, silver, tantalum and titanium are resistant.  Experts should be consulted when dealing with systems using wet chlorine.\n\n\nOther reactions\n\nUnder certain conditions, chlorine reacts with ammonia or ammonium compounds to form explosive nitrogen trichloride.  At the low concentrations normally found in water and wastewater plants, this is not a problem.\n\nChlorine reacts with organic compounds much the same as with inorganics to form chlorinated derivatives and hydrogen chloride.  Some of these reactions can be explosive, including those with oils, greases, solvents, and other hydrocarbons like alcohols and ethers.  Proper methods must be applied in operations in which they are involved.  Safe means of separation are essential.\n\nD.

Two one-ton containers are on-line inside the middle room of the Chlorination Building (located in the Southwest corner of the facility). \n\nChlorine is used primarily for disinfection of the effluent water prior to discharge through the NPDES permitted outfall to the Susquehanna River.  The WWTP operates on a 24-hour, 7-day per week schedule.  To reduce the impact a release during handling could have on the community and the environment, it is Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to changeout chlorine containers/cylinders only during the first shift (6:45 a.m. to 3:15 p.m.) Monday through Friday when the majority of personnel are present at the facility.\n\nA new wind sock was placed on top of the Chlorine Building in 2003 to check wind direction should a release occur.  A loud audible leak alarm inside the building is tied into the plant paging system and, if activated, will set off a red flashing light located on top of the Chlorine Building, as well as the light on the alarm panel in Building 2 (main office building). Automatic shut-offs for one (1) ton containers were purchased in 2000 to help control a leak once detected.  The automatic shut-offs consist of a racheting system that automatically closes the containers' valves.\n\nThe WWTP's Risk Management Program consists of a written SOP with written checklists from point of delivery of chlorine into the facility through changing of empty cylinders/containers with full cylinders/containers, and placement of the empties at a specific location at the Chlorination Building.\n\nThe Milton WWTP Chlorine Standard Operating Procedure (currently under revision), includes written direction for inspection of all incoming chlorine containers/cylinders for appropriate PA DOT tags, new lead washers, and corrosion.  The container cap is removed on delivery to inspect for corrosion of the valves.  Any container/cylinder not passing inspection at unloading is refused and returned to the delivery truck.  \n\nA Chlorine Change Check"

This training includes safe handling procedures, review of the handling SOP, application of Chlorine \"A\" and \"B\" kits, and general first aid for chlorine exposure.  Instructional training videos are used annually, or sooner if deemed necessary by the Lab Supervisor/Safety Coordinator. Employee participation in training seminars outside the facility is encouraged by plant management.\n\nDue to this comprehensive training program, detailed safety policies and procedures, and experience of the operators, the Milton Wastewater Treatment Plant has experienced no reportable chlorine leaks over the past five years.\n\nAs per EPA's Risk Management Programs Regulation, 40 CFR Part 68, the Milton WWTP complies with OSHA's Emergency Action Plan Regulation 29 CFR Part 1920.38.  Guidance from the Chlorine Institute, Water Environment Federation and the New York State Chlorine Manuals have been instrumental in the development of all chlorine related policies and procedures.  \n\nShould an accidental release occur at any time, the WWTP SOP specifically addresses a Level I release and a Level II release.  Level I releases are defined as incidental releases occurring at the time of handling by trained personnel providing there are no injuries.  A six-step procedure is to be followed as part of the emergency action plan.  \n\nA Level II release would be classified as a release that may cause a threat to personnel, becomes uncont"

A nine-step emergency action plan is to be followed and would result in contacting the County Emergency Services (911) for an emergency response.  In the event any release should occur, a Chemical Leak Report is to be filled out and submitted to the RMProgram Manager for review.  Together, all involved personnel review the situation and correct and revise any deficits in the Policy.\n\nThe worst case senario would entail a one-ton container leak outside on the unloading dock of the Chlorine Building where there is no passive mitigation.  The \"B\" Kit and personal protective equipment are readily available should an incident escalate to a Level II situation involving assistance from trained emergency response personnel.  \n\nThe alternative worst case senario would entail a one-ton container leak inside the Chlorine room.  Passive mitigation is present in that the leak would be contained within the room.  The automatic ventilation system would be shut down and the chlorine would be dispersed by ventilation dilution at a controlled rate by trained haz mat personnel from outside the facility.\n\nIn April 1996 a coordinated effort with WWTP personnel, local fire companies and the emergency medical service held a simulated chlorine leak drill combined with a confined space rescue.  The response time from the time the 911 call was placed until the container \"leak\" was stopped was 42 minutes.  This drill impressed upon every participant the importance of a trained response from all collective participants.  The Milton WWTP revised the existing Chlorine Standard Operating procedure at that time.  \n\nAs per EPA's Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, 40 CFR Part 355, the Northumberland County Local Emergency Planning Commission has had a Hazardous Materials Off-Site Response Plan in place since December 1996.

This program includes regular safety meetings and training, pro-active employees that help review the safety program, and adherence to federal, state, and local regulations."
