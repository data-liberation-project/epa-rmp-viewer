Employees must report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor.  Employees who violate safety standards, who cause a hazardous or dangerous situation, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.  Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from employees.

Report findings will be communicated to the Risk Management Program Manager and, if deemed necessary, scheduled for review.\n\nCommunication consists of daily computer operation/maintenance logs, and weekend process control guidelines.

Two one-ton containers are on-line inside the middle room of the Chlorination Building (located in the Southwest corner of the facility). \n\nChlorine is used primarily for disinfection of the effluent water prior to discharge through the NPDES permitted outfall to the Susquehanna River.  The WWTP operates on a 24-hour, 7-day per week schedule.  To reduce the impact a release during handling could have on the community and the environment, it is Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to changeout chlorine containers/cylinders only during the first shift (6:45 a.m. to 3:15 p.m.) Monday through Friday when the majority of personnel are present at the facility.\n\nA new wind sock was placed on top of the Chlorine Building in 2003 to check wind direction should a release occur.  A loud audible leak alarm inside the building is tied into the plant paging system and, if activated, will set off a red flashing light located on top of the Chlorine Building, as well as the light on the alarm panel in Building 2 (main office building). Automatic shut-offs for one (1) ton containers were purchased in 2000 to help control a leak once detected.  The automatic shut-offs consist of a racheting system that automatically closes the containers' valves.\n\nThe WWTP's Risk Management Program consists of a written SOP with written checklists from point of delivery of chlorine into the facility through changing of empty cylinders/containers with full cylinders/containers, and placement of the empties at a specific location at the Chlorination Building.\n\nThe Milton WWTP Chlorine Standard Operating Procedure (currently under revision), includes written direction for inspection of all incoming chlorine containers/cylinders for appropriate PA DOT tags, new lead washers, and corrosion.  The container cap is removed on delivery to inspect for corrosion of the valves.  Any container/cylinder not passing inspection at unloading is refused and returned to the delivery truck.  \n\nA Chlorine Change Check"

Daily weight of the on-line containers is recorded at 5:30 a.m., and entered into a chemical inventory computer program to monitor chlorine usage. This weight is also recorded on the Daily Operations Sheets once per day.  Management personnel review this inventory on a daily basis.\n\nThe PA DEP Operator's Outreach Program has presented training at the WWTP every three years.  Our most recent training was held on July 31, 2003.  This training includes safe handling procedures, review of the handling SOP, application of Chlorine \"A\" and \"B\" kits, and general first aid for chlorine exposure.  Instructional training videos are used annually, or sooner if deemed necessary by the Lab Supervisor/Safety Coordinator. Employee participation in training seminars outside the facility is encouraged by plant management.\n\nDue to this comprehensive training program, detailed safety policies and procedures, and experience of the operators, the Milton Wastewater Treatment Plant has experienced no reportable chlorine leaks over the past five years.\n\nAs per EPA's Risk Management Programs Regulation, 40 CFR Part 68, the Milton WWTP complies with OSHA's Emergency Action Plan Regulation 29 CFR Part 1920.38.  Guidance from the Chlorine Institute, Water Environment Federation and the New York State Chlorine Manuals have been instrumental in the development of all chlorine related policies and procedures.  \n\nShould an accidental release occur at any time, the WWTP SOP specifically addresses a Level I release and a Level II release.  Level I releases are defined as incidental releases occurring at the time of handling by trained personnel providing there are no injuries.

A nine-step emergency action plan is to be followed and would result in contacting the County Emergency Services (911) for an emergency response.  In the event any release should occur, a Chemical Leak Report is to be filled out and submitted to the RMProgram Manager for review.  Together, all involved personnel review the situation and correct and revise any deficits in the Policy.\n\nThe worst case senario would entail a one-ton container leak outside on the unloading dock of the Chlorine Building where there is no passive mitigation.  The \"B\" Kit and personal protective equipment are readily available should an incident escalate to a Level II situation involving assistance from trained emergency response personnel.  \n\nThe alternative worst case senario would entail a one-ton container leak inside the Chlorine room.  Passive mitigation is present in that the leak would be contained within the room.  The automatic ventilation system would be shut down and the chlorine would be dispersed by ventilation dilution at a controlled rate by trained haz mat personnel from outside the facility.\n\nIn April 1996 a coordinated effort with WWTP personnel, local fire companies and the emergency medical service held a simulated chlorine leak drill combined with a confined space rescue.  The response time from the time the 911 call was placed until the container \"leak\" was stopped was 42 minutes.  This drill impressed upon every participant the importance of a trained response from all collective participants.
