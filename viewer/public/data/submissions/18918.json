Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n    We at Townsends, Inc., Millsboro facility,  are strongly committed to employee, public and\nenvironmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy\nto implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \nUnforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are\nat hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n    Out facility's primary activities encompass Poultry Processing.  We have one (1) regulated\nsubstance present at our facility.  This substance is anhydrous ammonia.  The regulated substance\nat this facility has a singular use: refrigeration.  Our ammonia refrigeration system is separated\ninto\ntwo (2)  systems containing approximately 20,000 lbs. of ammonia each.  \n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), \n    including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the     \n    distances for each reported scenario\n\n    To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used RMP\nCOMP for the worst case scenario and ALOHA(R) for the alternate release scenario.  The\nfollowing\nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\n\n                                 Worst Case Scenario:     A failure or puncture of the high pressure receiver\n            of either system    would release the greatest quantity of ammonia for our facility. \n                        About 20,000 pounds of ammonia would be released as a liquid\n                        which would then vaporize. It is"

The distance extends beyond the facility boundary,\n                       encompasses several businesses and residences, schools, and an adult\n                       care facility .\n\n                        Alternative Scenario:    A leak from a short pipe or valve in a horizontal\n            cylindrical tank would release 1,789 lbs. over a three minute release duration and\n                        would reach an offsite receptor.  \n\n                        The distance to the endpoint of 0.14mg/L is 0.3 miles.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the                       \n    Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n    Our facility has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release\nprevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and\nconstructed in accordance with NEPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The ammonia refrigeration\nprocess at this facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The\nfollowing\nsections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our\nstationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTownsends, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\nhazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes\nare identified and controlled efficiently.
