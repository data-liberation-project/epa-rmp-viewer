      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMP) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY-ISP ALGINATES SAN DIEGO PLANTIntroduction\nISP Alginates San Diego Plant is a food ingredients manufacturing operation located on the harbor in the city of San Diego.  Our products are derived from natural materials, and most are used to create desired textures in foods. Some of our products fulfill special pharmaceutical needs, and others impart valuable flow properties in industrial applications.  We employ 130 people in our San Diego operations.  Our business has operated safely in San Diego for 75 years.\n\nPolicies\nOur accidental release prevention policies are based on investment in state-of-the-art chemical handling systems, and operating in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The chemical handling systems, and our PSM program, are further described later in this document. \n\nOur approach to emergency response is based on using on-site expertise, to support the function of the San Diego Fire Department and the City and County Hazmat Units. We have an on-site emergency coordination station staffed whenever the plant is operating.  The employees who staff the emergency coordination station are specially trained to take incident reports and to speedily communicate to the appropriate emergency service agencies, such as the Fire Department or paramedics. \n                                                                                                                                                                                     The San Diego Fire Department has good familiarity with our facility, and stands ready to back-up our ERT if ever needed. The nearest fire station is less than one mile away, and can have an engine company at our facility within a few minutes.  The Fire Department has the expertise and resources to assist the community with notification, shelter-in-place, evacuation or other community protection methods appropriate for a given situation.   \n\nRegulated Substances & Ch"

      "SummaryText": "emical Specific Prevention Steps \nOur operation has two chemical processes regulated by the RMP, one using chlorine and the other using propylene oxide.  \n\nChlorine is a toxic gas with a sharp, irritating odor,  greenish-yellow in color.  We handle chlorine in cylinders constructed of 1 1/4\" thick steel plate.  Each cylinder contains about 165 gallons of chlorine, or one-ton.  Chlorine is used directly from the cylinders, with no other storage vessels.  The key safety components of our chlorine installation are a containment building, a continuous air monitor, a scrubber and a vacuum piping system.\n\nUpon arrival at the plant the chlorine cylinders are unstrapped from the delivery truck and moved a short distance using a dedicated overhead hoist into an adjacent chlorine containment building.   The containment building has a continuous air monitoring sensor and alarm.  If one part per million chlorine is detected inside the containment building, an audio alarm and a flashing light outside the building indicates chlorine is present.  If three parts per million chlorine is detected (a level safe for extended exposure), a building exhaust scrubber activates which captures the atmosphere of the containment building.  The scrubber is charged with liquid capable of absorbing and converting the full contents of one chlorine cylinder to stable sodium hypochlorite (common bleach) solution.  \n\nChlorine is drawn into our manufacturing process through individual vacuum regulator valves mounted on each active cylinder.  Chlorine can only flow through the vacuum regulator valves if the process piping is under vacuum.  A vacuum eductor at each use point pulls chlorine through the piping.  Any  break or leak would cause the piping to lose vacuum, which would cause the vacuum regulator valves to automatically shut off chlorine flow at the cylinders.  \n\nPropylene oxide is a liquid solvent whose vapors are toxic if inhaled, though much less toxic than chlorine.  Propylene oxide is deli"

      "SummaryText": "vered in sealed rail cars, and stored in two double-contained underground storage tanks.  Some of the key safety features of the propylene oxide system are rail cars with all valving on the top of the car, vapor return lines to capture propylene oxide vapor, nitrogen blankets in the headspace of all storage tanks, double-contained, state-of-the-art storage tank design, and continuous storage tank leak detection.    \n\nPropylene oxide is pumped from the top of the rail car to the underground storage tanks through welded steel piping that is inspected daily for integrity.  Nitrogen headspace pressure in the storage tanks, and in the rail car, provides an atmosphere that does not support combustion, and that delivers propylene oxide into the production process. \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\nIn addition to the installed chemical handling systems described above, our chemical release prevention system employs the full range of practices required by OSHA Process Safety Management. Our plant has been operating under PSM for over ten years, and the program is now well developed.  Some  highlights include:\n\n\t-A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted every 5 years or more frequently.  We use the Hazop (Hazard & Operability Study) method, because it is a very thorough and rigorous PHA system. This involves a team of engineers, process technicians and maintenance technicians, who use a formal, defined system to review the hazards posed by the chemical,  and consider best industry practices for using the material in our plant.  Recommendations for improvement are made and priorities set for implementing them.  Last year two of our staff received a 4-day off-site training course to update their skills in PHA leadership.  We recently updated our PHA for propylene oxide, and identified several enhancements..  Our last chlorine PHA was completed less than 4 years ago, and there have been very few chlorine system changes. We plan to update our chlorine PHA next yea"

This involves  inspection and servicing of every portion of the PSM-covered systems on a regular schedule. There are over 400 components of these sytems that are inspected, tested, calibrated or rebuilt on a scheduled basis.  The schedule is set to perform service before failure.   The mechanical integrity system was thoroughly reviewed last year to verify that the service intervals were effective and economic.\n\n\t-Written work instructions provide detailed procedures for employees operating the equipment.  Included is a thorough Safety Procedures Manual, which is under ongoing review and improvement.  Training is provided before employees are allowed to operate critical equipment without direct oversight.\n\n\t-A documented Management of Change system controls modifications to equipment and operating parameters.  Each change is reviewed beforehand by appropriate personnel to determine if there is any impact to system safety.\n\n\t-The site uses a number of contract personnel for a variety of services.  Our contractor  safety program requires that contractors actual safety performance be reviewed and approved in order to qualify for work at our plant.  Training and open communication is maintained with contract employees to identify and control hazards.\n\nIn addition, we maintain a number of adjunct systems and equipment for specific chemicals.  Examples include:\n\n\u00b7 local and remote chlorine alarms to quickly respond to leaks\n- \"emergency off\" buttons in strategic places in our propylene oxide processes to shut down entire systems with one push\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe facility has never had a release of chlorine or propylene oxide that resulted in community injury or health impact in over 50 years of using these materials.

The fire was contained in just a few pieces of equipment, and promptly extinguished by the Fire Department.  A thorough incident investigation followed, and numerous additional safeguards were put in place to prevent a recurrence.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAll employees are trained to recognize potential emergency situations, and to call a 24-hour staffed emergency control center located in our Quality Control Lab.  Depending on the nature of the emergency, the Fire Department, paramedics, or the plant management.  \n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\nDuring the past year we have implemented new propylene oxide reactor purge procedures to prevent excess propylene oxide from entering the dryer systems.  These include both installation of new process control instrumentation, and new procedures to increase operator knowledge and accountability for safe operation of the propylene oxide   processes.                                                                                                                                                                               \nIn 1999 we invited the San Diego City Fire Department's Hazmat Coordinator to review both our propylene oxide system and our chlorine system, and make recommendations.  Regarding our chlorine system, he found no improvements needed, and commented positively on the attributes of our release prevention and capture system. Regarding the propylene oxide system, he recommended that we host a Fire Department drill based on a propylene oxide release scenario.  This drill took place December, 1999."
