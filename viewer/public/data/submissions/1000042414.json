This California reportable event (OES, Local CUPA/911) did not result in any on or offsite consequences as defined by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n1.5 The Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis plant is specifically designed and engineered to provide for life safety and effective emergency response. Building space is fire-alarm, ammonia alarm and fire-sprinkler equipped. The refrigeration process' Control, Monitoring and Alarm System includes a backup power supply (UPS) and manual backup systems (kill switches). The system initiates notifications, alarms, equipment shutdown and pump-down of the affected area according to the location, nature and severity of the problem. Authorized personnel can access critical process system controls remotely. A KNOX system is coordinated and kept up to date via communications with the Oxnard Fire Department/CUPA. The automatic systems and devices are regularly inspected, tested and maintained. Employees are trained in manual discovery, emergency shutdown, evacuation and notification procedures in the highly unlikely event of a failure of the engineered safety and emergency systems.\r\n\r\nThe Plant does not require its employees to participate in conducting emergency response activities under the HAZWOPER standard; a Non-responding Facility Policy has been adopted for the Plant as a whole. In the event of an ammonia emergency, the response is to follow the procedures in the Equipment SOP's and the California Hazardous Material Business Plan. The overall procedure is to shutdown critical systems if it can be done safely by qualified personnel, evacuate, and notify the local response agencies and WPS; WPS employs technicians that are 1910.120(q) Hazardous Material Technician certified. Plant employees are to implement hazard communications, provide for the safety of visitors and report to the established Evacuation Staging Area(s) for a head count"

The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs. Company safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances. The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen. It is the goal of the company to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  \r\n\r\nA Non Responding Facility policy has been adopted; however the Company recognizes the need to be prepared to safely deal with emergencies. A Hazardous Material Business Plan consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements has been developed and includes emergency procedures, requirements, and information necessary to notify public response agencies and technical resources; the Staff communicate to the Fire Department and evacuate (or shelter-in-place) if there is a release situation or fire.

The elements of the PSM Program are intended to be integrated with the ongoing functions of the facility. The program is specifically intended to prevent an occurrence and minimize the consequences of an Anhydrous Ammonia release. In California the PSM program is in accordance with CCR 8, 5189.\r\n\r\nWritten procedures have been developed for the daily operation of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release. The written procedures include necessary safety precautions and address each operating phase as defined by the Cal-ARP RMP/PSM Program. Refrigeration systems are only operated by pre-qualified personnel that are trained and qualified in the relevant operating and safety procedures. The Written Operating Procedures are maintained online & on-site and are regularly validated for accuracy.\r\n\r\nScheduled inspections and maintenance are executed by Western Precooling Systems (WPS) qualified technicians and/or pre-qualified specialty vendors. WPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA). WPS Technicians participate in a state of the art online training program that includes RETA course materials (Web-based Business Manager/WBBM).\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOver the years it had become apparent in the Industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system was one of the most common release incidents to occur. Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow. If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task,"

Ocean Breeze Cooling is 100% owned by WPS but operations are separated:  Ocean Breeze Cooling manages pre-cooling, refrigerated storage and shipping of fresh produce; WPS supervises and maintains the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThe facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables and fruit (primarily strawberries). The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and short-term storage is on site generally for four days from harvesting. The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods picking up in the month of October and finishing in July. The remaining months see little fresh product, however the refrigeration equipment is still operative. Major maintenance is performed in the off-season. Operational maintenance is performed on a year-round basis. Company policy requires appropriately pre-qualified personnel to perform maintenance tasks.\r\n\r\nThe Regulated Substance in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a single closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system. Refrigeration equipment consists of Portable Compressor/Condenser Units, Portable and Stationary Pressure Cooling Units, Portable Vacuum Tubes, Pressure Vessels, Pumps, Room Evaporators, piping and two Ammonia-water Diffusion Systems. Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure safety relief valves. The Ammonia-water Diffusion Systems protect Safety Relief Valves from venting directly to atmosphere. An automated refrigeration control, monitoring and alarm system automatically monitors the system. The Alarm System is supervised 24/7/365 by a third party alarm company which maintains pre-determined call lists and parameters.

The facility has installed these types of valves at each of the system's oil drain points.  Modifications have been made to the piping system to provide support in the event of seismic activity. Relief valves have been piped to water absorbing tanks (dispersion/diffusion). Relief valve excursions were another unwanted release potential and by routing to a secondary containment system the effects of a relief situation have been mitigated.  \r\n\r\nOther release prevention steps taken at OBC:\r\n - The facility is enclosed with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility to increase the security of the facility from potential wrong-do-ers.\r\n - Per the PSM Program access to process areas is controlled by a sign-in/sign-out program \r\n - Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal's etc. Training is documented through an Online Training System (WBBM).\r\n - A strong relationship exists with the Oxnard Fire Department. There have been demonstrations and tours of the system with the first responding engine companies to familiarize the crews with the facility layout and where hazardous areas are located.\r\n - The compressor area is microprocessor controlled with internet access for computer monitoring and parameter changes. The equipment may be shutdown from off site via phone if it were not possible to directly access the control area.\r\n - There is an automatic texting function that is connected to the computer control.  When there is an equipment failure, or when the pressures are rising and approaching the shutdown setting, or if there is a power failure, a text alert is automatically sent to technicians and cooler managers.\r\n - Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.
