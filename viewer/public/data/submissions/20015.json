THE PURPOSE OF ATHIS RELATIONSHIIP  IS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF A RELEASE TO THE PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THIS FACILITY IS THE STORAGE OF FERTILIZER AND PROPANE FOR FUTURE SALES TO PATRONS.\n     THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ANHYDROUS WILL BE 79,560    POUNDS WHEN THE TANK IS 85% FULL.THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PROPANE WILL BE 19,200 POUNDSWHEN THE TANK IS 85% FULL.\n     A WORST CASE SCENARIO RELEASE WOULD BE THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK OR            POUNDS, RELEASED AS A GAS OVE 10 MINUTES.

THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 1.1          MILES.\n     TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL RELEASES, THE EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TRAINED USING A FORMAT PROVIDED BY CENEX/ LAND-O-LAKES IN, THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY BOOKLET   WE ALSO COMPLY WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION.    \n\n     IN THE PAST 5 YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS THAT HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES OR DAMAGE TO FACILITIES OR, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, CAUSED OFFSITE DEATH, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, PROPERTY OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n     WE HAVE COMPLIED IN THE PAST BY HAVING A WRITTEN EMERGENCY PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA AND SARA TITLE III , AND BY GIVING THAT PLAN TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND REVIEWONG IT WITHOUR EMPLOYEES AND LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS.\n     AT THE ADELL COOPERATIVE UNION IN ADELL WISCONSIN, THE EMPLOYEES TRY VERY HARD TO DO THE BEST JOB THEY CAN, AND THEY REALIZE THAT THERE IS NO EXCUSE TO DO A  POOR JOB.
