If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the inpact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2. The Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the faciltily is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by farmers.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored on site would be 393,975 lbs; 131,325 lbs in each of 3 - 30,000 gallon storage tanks. \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of anhydrous ammonia storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes.The maximum quantity release would be 131,325 lbs which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85% capacity as limited by designed standards.The worst-case release would result in leaving the materials property.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in the transfer hose which might result in the release of 11,908 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.The alternative case release would result in the material leaving the facilitie's property.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that : \n\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damag"

The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has :\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; \nb. Provided State and Local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information is required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nC. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency training and employee training\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvments is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time, June 7, 2004"
