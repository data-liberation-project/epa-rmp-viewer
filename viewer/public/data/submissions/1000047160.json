In addition, an Operation and Maintenance (O & M) Manual and Standard Operating Procedures have been developed for the facility, which provides detailed operation, maintenance and safety procedures for the processes and equipment at the plant.  \r\n\r\nOver the past 5-year period, no accidents have occurred involving the release of any chemicals held above a threshold quantity as defined by 29 CFR 68.130.  The City of Cayce maintains an Emergency Action Plan outlining procedures to follow in the event of a chemical release at the WTP.  It is the policy of the City of Cayce that WTP employees will not respond to accidental releases of chlorine.  The PSMP developed for the WTP contains coordination and notification procedures that are to be followed for WTP employees in the event of a chemical release."

      "SummaryText": "The City of Cayce Water Treatment Plant, Stanley L. Goodwin Facility (WTP) is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures through various training, safety, emergency and accidental release prevention programs, and through overall process safety management.  The City is responsible for the training of all employees at the water treatment plant.  All new employees are provided training on the following topics, at a minimum:  the requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200, hazardous chemicals used in the plant, how to read and get information from Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), hazards associated with each treatment process, operation, testing and routine maintenance of safety systems used in processes involving highly hazardous chemicals, use of personal protective equipment, emergency procedures, understanding process safety management, and the location of SDSs, the Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) for the facility, and other safety information.  Employee training for highly hazardous chemicals is provided for all employees at the time of their initial assignment to the facility or to a specific process and any time a new chemical or process is introduced in the plant.  In addition, once every three years and more often if necessary, the City must provide each employee with a refresher training course covering these topics.  Further training is also provided on various topics related to the facility and its processes once per week.  \r\n\r\nThe City of Cayce Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is located on Charleston Highway (U.S. 321) adjacent to the Congaree Creek in Cayce, SC.  The plant currently has a daily process capacity of 9.6 million gallons per day, on average.  Treatment at the plant consists of clarification, filtration, pH adjustment, polyphosphate addition, chlorine gas injection, and fluoride addition.  The following substances are used in the treatment processes: carbon, lime, sodium hydroxide, potassium permanganate,"
