More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an acicdental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThis company maintains and operates their NH3 plant in strict accordance with all Federal, State and Local authorities.  The Knasas Department of Agriculture inspect our plants on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement.  Changes or improvements in the facilities equipment will be acted upon immediately following the enforcement agency (KDA) request, or as found to be necessary by our maintenance staff.\n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site specific operating procedures, proper plant maintenance and employees are competency tested over the training material.  Each employee uses goggles and gloves during ammonia transfer operations as well as always providing plenty of emergency safety water during nurse tank loading operations.\n\nWitht the above mentioned training in mind, it makes it very simple to report that absolutely no injury accidents or property damage have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nOur emergency action plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public and the area first responders.
