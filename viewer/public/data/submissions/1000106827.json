This means that has a systematic approach to all changes including chemical entry, emergency response procedure, hazard communication and considers the interested parties affected by all the changes, like employees, contractors, visitors, regulatory agencies, and community just to mention a few.\nIn terms of accident releases of propane, or any other hazardous material, the site has local standard operating procedures (SOP), SG-01-01-003, to address any type of emergency including, fires, explosion, public threats like strikes, terrorism, hurricanes, injuries, among others. The site also has a procedure for the fire prevention and suppression systems, SG-01-01-040, to address how the fire systems must be properly use. The fire protection system is inspected once a year by an external certified contractor and the site must comply also with Fire Department requirements, PR OSHA requirements and regulations, AXA XL insurance company requirements, and corporate requirements for fire prevention and safety. Fire drills are done with employees 1-2 times a year. To prevent fires, the site has an SOP for Hot Work, SG-01-01-015, that includes working permits to ensure the appropriate distances are respected from any flammable or combustible substances.\nThe facility is a Pharma and Medical Device manufacturer for transfusion technologies used to separate blood from its components. It is one of the most important suppliers for the American Red Cross globally and the BCA. The propane used for the purpose of this plan is for fuel for the steam generators of the new mechanical room, that are used to distill water and convert it in water for injection.\nThe site is exempt from OSHA\u0092s PSM since the propane is used as fuel only, nevertheless the site has inspections programs to monitor the safety and security of the storage area and the areas that use the pro"

The storage area of the propane is monitored 24/7 with CCTV systems, and Security officers are always on-site performing rounds. The area is locked and access to it must be gained through the Security Officers.\nSince the propane tank was installed and filled in 2022 no incidents have occurred. In case of an incident, the site has a specific emergency response plan for propane, that addresses the different scenarios and the chain of command to follow. The agencies to be contacted as part of the plan are the Fire Dept., Police, local Emergency Management Administration and LEPC.\nThe following improvements will be done: installation of wind direction indicator,  lightning arrester on tank perimeter fence, installation of propane leak detectors and heat detectors on mechanical room where steam generators are located, periodic inspections on tanks and LPG piping supply, integrity testing will be implemented as part of the preventive maintenance, training and drill to practice response in case of explosion and BLEVE, this will be done in coordination with the local agencies."
