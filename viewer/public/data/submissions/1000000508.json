The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined; to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Philpott plant involves the failure of a 1-ton cylinder (2,000 lbs. of chlorine). The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions. The first set followed conditions predefined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount of gas in a full cylinder in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average EPRG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis.  \n\nEPA mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec. When atmospheric dispersion modeling of the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 344 was obtained. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the break of a \u00c2\u00bd inch pigtail flexible connector with an amount released of 37 lbs. over a one-hour period. The toxic endpoint distance to ERPG-2 is 0.1 miles and the estimate of residential population potentially affected is 9.\n\nd.

The Henry County Public Service Authority's (PSA) accidental release prevention program involves three items: Technology, Management and Procedural Practices. The PSA's emergency action plan involves coordination between plant personnel, management, and public safety responders. The PSA is committed to providing a safe working environment for its employees and to the communities to which it serves. \n\nb. The Upper Smith River Water Filtration Plant (Philpott) is a water purification plant owned by Henry County and operated by the Henry County Public Service Authority (PSA). The plant is located at 590 Philpott Drive in Bassett, Virginia. This facility purifies and supplies water to the Bassett, Stanleytown, Collinsville, Fieldale, Ridgeway, 58 West, Axton and the 57 West areas. The plant is rated at 4.0 MGD. Chlorine is utilized for disinfection. The operation uses and stores 4, 1-ton cylinders of chlorine gas on site. The existing chlorine system operates when the facility is manned. The chlorine system is monitored  by electronic sensors with remotely activated audible and visual indicators and also by the plant operatortions staff. Alarmed conditions are responded to by a given protocol and trained personnel.\n\nc. The offsite consequence analysis includes two chlorine release scenarios, which are identified as a Worst Case Release Scenario and an Alternative Release Scenario. The Worst Case Scenario is defined by the EPA and states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure. The Alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario. \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by chlorine release before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2).
