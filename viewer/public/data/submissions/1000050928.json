Operators are always present during repackaging operations to observe pressure and temperature gauges on tanks and pipes and to be alert for any releases of pressure relief valves installed on tanks or hydrostats on piping systems. In accordance with DOT requirements, valve assemblies on anhydrous ammonia cylinders are inspected upon each return for refilling.  Faulty valves are rebuilt or replaced.  The date stamped for hydrostatic testing of cylinders is checked and each cylinder is repainted for corrosion protection before refilling.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company trains their operators carefully before allowing them to take the lead in repackaging operations.

The facility also stores and distributes 150-pound chlorine cylinders to customers.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia Unloading System (Aqueous Ammonia Production)\r\n\r\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Production Process manufactures aqueous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is pumped from the transport vehicle and mixed with water in a reaction chamber to produce aqueous ammonia.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia Unloading System (Refrigeration Grade Ammonia)\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia Unloading System is used for unloading transport vehicles directly into either the Storage Tank or the tank trucks.  The Storage Tank is used to transfer anhydrous ammonia to the tank truck.  Several safety mechanisms (i.e., scrubber, excess flow valves, emergency shutoff switch) are incorporated into the design of the system\r\n.\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia Repackaging, Storage and Distribution Process\r\n\r\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Repackaging, Storage and Distribution Process consists of a truck unloading station, a pressurized storage tank, a holding vessel and pump for cylinder filling, a cylinder fill station, ammonia recovery equipment, piping and valves.  The system stores an"

      "SummaryText": "d repackages anhydrous ammonia for distribution. \r\n\r\nChlorine Warehouse\r\n\r\nThe Chlorine Warehouse Process consists of a warehouse building, a truck loading/unloading dock and indoor storage racks for 150-lb cylinders of chlorine.  All cylinders are inspected upon arrival at the facility to ensure that they meet all applicable safety codes.  Defective cylinders, including those missing safety caps, are returned to the supplier.  Cylinders are restrained in the upright position during transport and storage.  The chlorine is shipped in cylinders compliant with DOT requirements. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has a PSM program in place to manage the handling of ammonia and chlorine, which complies with Federal RMP, CalARP and PSM requirements.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqueous Ammonia\r\n\r\nHill Brothers Chemical Company prevention program emphasizes risk management through use of equipment rated for ammonia service; training for its employees in hazard communication; proper operating procedures for the ammonia systems; level, pressure and temperature limits for process equipment and storage tanks; implementation of programs to maintain the mechanical integrity of equipment; internal auditing and inspect"
