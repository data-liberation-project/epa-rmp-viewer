This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Aspire Bakeries policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \nThe Aspire Bakeries facility is located at 15963 Strathern St, Van Nuys, California 91406.  The regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia and will report the estimated inventory of 11,081 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia which has been rounded to 11,000 pounds per EPA RMP Guidance documents.  The maximum intended inventory for this facility is 11,720 pounds. Refer to the Process Safety Information section for related ammonia inventory calculations and information.\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Aspire Bakeries has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\u0095\tWell-designed Relief System\n\u0095\tSafety Showers/Eyewash Stations\n\u0095\tGas Detection (various locations, setpoints, and functions)\n\u0095\tAmmonia Diffusion Tank\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were docume"
