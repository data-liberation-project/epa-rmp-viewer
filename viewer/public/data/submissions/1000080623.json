      "SummaryText": "Amrex Chemical Company is a wholesale chemical distributor that warehouses and repackages a variety of hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals.  The E. Frederick Street facility is the main office and warehousing facility.  This facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. The following hazardous chemicals subject to PSM are stored on site:  Anhydrous Ammonia, Formaldehyde, and Hydrogen Chloride (stored as aqueous Hydrochloric Acid).   Hydrofluoric Acid 70% was reported in 2009; however inventory of this material had been eliminated below the threshold quantity in 2014 and has now been eliminated from this facility. \r\n\r\nChemicals subject to EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements includes Ammonia (conc 20% or greater).  \r\nAnhydrous ammonia was reported in 1999; however inventory of this material had been reduced below the threshold quantity and has remained below the threshold quantity. \r\nHydrofluoric Acid 70% was reported in 2009; however inventory of this material had been eliminated below the threshold quantity in 2014 and has now been eliminated from this facility. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe facility's prevention program includes implementation of procedures to address employee safety and to reduce risk of accidents involving hazardous chemicals.  A neutralization system has been upgraded and a de-chlorination system has been installed to capture, contain and neutralize spills and rinse water.  A transfer area that has secondary containment that can be directed into the neutralization tank is also in place. This program has been successful in that there have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.  The facility also has a written emergency response plan that includes specific actions to be taken in the event of a spill.  Employees receive regular training in both the prevention program and the emergency response plan.  The facility seeks to improve safety by regular review of its safety policies and performance."
