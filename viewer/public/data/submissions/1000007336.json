      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBlock 31 Plant\n\nThe Block 31 Plant has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Block 31 Gas Plant is a gas processing and pressure maintenance facility located west of Crane, Texas. The plant has several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane.\nThe Block 31 Gas Plant handles gas produced from the Block 31 field which processed to remove natural gas liquids (NGLs) and produced gas is used for fuel or sold. Gas comes into the plant at pressures ranging from 10 psig to 1200 psig. Gas must be at 1200 psig for processing; therefore compression is required for streams coming into the plant at lower pressures. Any liquid that drops out from the gas during compression is returned to the field operations and combined with the oil production. After inlet compression, the gas is split into two streams. Part of the gas flows straight to injection, and part flows to Nitrogen Rejection Facility (NRF) for processing.\n\nNITROGEN REJECTION FACILITY (NRF)\nDiglycolamine (DGA) is used to sweeten, or remove CO2 and H2S from, the gas stream that flows through the NRF. The rich DGA is regenerated by reducing the pressure and then heating the amine to remove any light hydrocarbons, CO2, and H2S. Steam provides the heat needed for this regeneration. The hydrocarbon gases driven off are returned to the plant inlet gas system. The acid gases CO2 and H2S are compressed and injected. The lean DGA returns to the amine contactor to sweeten more gas.\nNR"

      "SummaryText": "F feed gas is dehydrated after the sweetening. Triethylene glycol absorbs water and a small amount of light hydrocarbon from the gas. After contacting the gas, the rich glycol is heated and flows into a flash take where light hydrocarbons vaporize. These light hydrocarbons are returned to the plant inlet system. Water and remaining hydrocarbon gases are removed from the glycol in the glycol reboiler, which is heated by steam. The water and hydrocarbon vent gases are released to the atmosphere. These gases are condensed to recover liquids and return the remaining vapor back to our inlets system. The lean glycol returns to the glycol contactors to continue the process.\nThe gas must be free of all water, CO2, and H2S before entering the cryogenic process. Mol sieve beds are used to remove any remaining water, CO2, and H2S. Two beds are in service while two beds are being regenerated. Beds are regenerated using heated nitrogen that flows countercurrent to the process flow. Regeneration gas is cooled and reinjected into the reservoir. Regeneration gas heaters burn sweet residue gas\nThe sweetened, dehydrated gas flows through the cryogenic process for removal of ethane and heavier hydrocarbons. The gas is chilled to very low temperatures using a single stage turbo expansion process. The liquids removed are stored in pressurized tanks and pumped into pipelines for sales.\nThe remaining gas is a mixture of methane and nitrogen. These are separated in the Nitrogen Rejection Unit(s) (NRUA?s). The NRUA?s chill the gas to condense methane from nitrogen. The nitrogen is vented or injected, and the methane is vaporized and used for plant fuel or sold.\nAuxiliary Systems\nSteam is the heat source for many units at Block 31. Steam is produced in two boilers. Each boiler by itself is capable of producing the entire plantA?s steam requirements. Both are operated in the event an upset occurs with one, there is no downtime in getting steam from the other unit. The sweet residue gas is bur"

The pilot stream is sweet residue gas.\nA drain system in the plant carries fluids to sumps scattered throughout the plant and the fluids from sumps are pumped into five pits. Oil collected in these pits is routed to the slop oil pit, then to the slop oil tank, and pumped to the oil production facility. Water ends up in the largest pit before injection into a disposal well.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nThe Block 31 Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe Block 31 Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, "

The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Block 31 Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \nThe Block 31 Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducte"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nThe Block 31 Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as \n  (1)Unit startup, \n  (2)Normal operations, \n  (3)Temporary operations, \n  (4)Emergency shutdown, \n  (5)Normal shutdown, and \n  (6)Initial startup of a new process.  \nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTRAINING\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Block 31 Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conduced at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nThe Block 31 Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRS)\nThe Block 31 Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements be properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nThe Block 31 Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: \n (1)Conducting training, \n (2)Developing written procedures, \n (3)Performing inspections and tests, \n (4)Correcting identified deficiencies, and \n (5)Applying quality assurance measures.  \nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\nMaintenance personnel receive training on:\n (1)An ov"

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Block 31 Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\nThe Block 31 Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:\n (1)Control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, \n (2)A lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, \n (3)A procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, \n (4)A permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and \n(5)    A permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  \nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nThe Block 3"
