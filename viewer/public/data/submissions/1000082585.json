In response to the congressional mandate, EPA promulgated the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).\r\n\tThe RMP Rule identified covered facilities on the basis of use/storage of threshold quantities of any of a long list of chemicals (see 40 CFR Part 68.130, Table 1) and required those facilities to submit to EPA a completed RMP by June 21, 1999.  Further, the RMP Rule requires that all covered facilities must review all aspects of their respective plans and re-submit to EPA RMP updates every five years thereafter as long as a facility is covered by the Rule.  This RMP was updated in accordance with the RMP rules in 2004, 2009 and is hereby updated as of June, 2014.\r\n \r\nFINDINGS (as of June, 2014)\r\n\tA fourth compliance audit and a hazard review was completed in June, 2014 for the City of Westwego's wastewater treatment plant as required by the RMP rule and the appropriate offsite consequence assessment (OCA) modeling was re-visited as well.  No significant problems were noted by those efforts.  The OCA continues to predict a very small impact area such that area residents/occupants should have little to no concern relative to the subject facility.\r\n\tA dress rehearsal of the implementation of the Emergency Response Plan component of the subject facility's RMP was held on Thursday, May 28, 2009 and again on January 20, 2010.  A log for those dress rehearsals are provided in Appendix A.  A new dress rehearsal of the implementation of the Emergency Response"
