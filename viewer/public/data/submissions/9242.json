A new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to maintain their skills and knowledge at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.  Training is documented for each operator, including demonstrated skills used to verify that the operator understood the training.  Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and systems.  Operational and maintenance personnel also receive training on the procedures for conducting hot work permitting; management of change; and other appropriate safe work practices.  \n \n Contractors\n \n The Larose Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  As part of a contractor safety management program, contractor's safety programs and performance are evaluated, contractors are oriented to the potential hazards and applicable emergency procedures, and periodically reviewed for their safety performance while on the job.

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan\nLarose Gas Processing Plant\nExecutive Summary\n\nLaDEQ Facility ID No. 27399\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES \t\n\nThe Larose Gas Processing Plant is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\t \n\nThe Larose Gas Processing Plant is located on Louisiana State Highway No. 24 approximately one half mile west of Larose, Louisiana.  The Larose Gas Processing Plant provides condensate removal, conditioning, natural gas drying, and cryogenic processing of natural gas for a natural gas gathering pipeline system.  Methane, condensate and natural gas liquid products are shipped from the facility via pipeline systems.  The Larose Gas Processing Plant is capable of storing both propane and butane to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for the Larose Gas Processing Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest inventory of a flammable mixture (Natural Gas Liquid - Raw Make consisting predominately of Ethane, Propane and Butane), contained in a single pressurized process vessel.  The maximum quantity possible contained within this process vessel during an unlikely severe process upset is 180,000 pounds.  Although process and administrative controls are in place to limit this quantity, those controls were not considered in calculating this maximum quantity determination.  The entire inventory of the process vessel is ass"

Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the 1-psig overpressure endpoint is 0.4 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases, and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures is taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) that is used as a planning case at the Larose Gas Processing Plant is a, 3/4 outside diameter tubing line rupture within the residue gas cooler causing a residue natural gas release to the cooling water discharge line.  The natural gas release reaches the outfall structure at Bayou Blue through the cooling water discharge line. The release rate is 1,000 pounds per minute and is assumed to last for 15 minutes before valves can be realigned to stop the release.  The released natural gas is ignited causing a vapor cloud fire.  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the lower flammability limit endpoint for this scenario is 0.1 mile.  With a radius of 0.1 mile, this ARS would extend outside of the boundary of the Larose Gas Processing Plant.  There are no offsite receptors impacted by this ARS.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \n  The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the facility.  The process at the Larose Gas Processing Plant is regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Because RMP accident prevention requirements for this process are essentially the same as PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements, and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the Larose Gas Processing Plant.  \n \n Emp"
