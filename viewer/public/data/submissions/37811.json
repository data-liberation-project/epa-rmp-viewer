      "SummaryText": "Maumee Complex RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Maumee Wholesale Fertilizer facility is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular) and miscellaneous farm supplies.  The Liquid Poly Phosphate Processing facility began operations in the fall of 1994.  Key personnel at the Maumee facility are Ed Norris - facility manager and Joe Schweitzer - operations manager.\n\nThe facility manufactures a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  Production rates average 18,000 tons of 10-34-0 fertilizer per year.\n\nThe Liquid Plant occupies approximately 2.5 acres and is situated on the west side of The Andersons Complex and northeast of the intersection of Ford Street and Illinois Ave.  There are two businesses directly to the north, Williams Brothers Concrete and Stoneco.  Charlie\u00bfs Dodge Dealership is located to the west, on the other side of Ford St.  The Andersons General Store is southeast of the plant, across Illlinois Ave.  \n\nThe only RMP-regulated material stored at the Maumee Complex is anhydrous ammonia at the Wholesale Fertilizer facility.  A 30,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 25,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhyd"

      "SummaryText": "rous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.  Anhydrous ammonia has a strong chemical affinity for water and therefore, an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia and propane emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as indicated by the alternative release scenario. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (a tanker truck or rail car) to the bulk storage tank.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced by the transporter or The Andersons in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers of anhydrous from the bulk storage tank to the processing system occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow.\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \u00bfevents\u00bf are very short in duration \u00bf a few seconds at the most.  \n\nA complete failure or burst tank, as indicated by the worst case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank for anhydrous ammonia was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code. The National Board Certificates for the tank is on file.   The storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tanks or appendages are performed by certified welders and stamped accordingly.  \n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechan"

The passive mitigation systems in place at the Maumee facility are:\n\u00bf  Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\n\u00bf  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection points to the storage tanks. If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank(s), the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n \nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Maumee facility are:\n\u00bf  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on both storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won\u00bft reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\u00bf  Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia or propane from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tank.\n\u00bf  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n\u00bf  An emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the anhydrous ammonia bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves (\u00bfs"

The evaluation team includes representatives from the corporate Safety Department, group Management and Operations employees.\n\nEach \u00bfwhat-if\u00bf situation is discussed and possible causes are listed.

When plotted, a risk value is assigned from 1 \u00bf 10; again with \u00bf1\u00bf being the worst and most critical item and \u00bf10\u00bf being of least consequence.  Finally, results are evaluated and prioritized.\n\nFormal investigations are performed for all environmental or safety incidents.
