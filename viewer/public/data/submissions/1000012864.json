              "Description": "Channel uses one 6,000-gallon (5,000-gallon working capacity) tank for storing Formaldehyde Solution. The tank is hardpiped inside the diked area to a centrifigal pump and then to the reactor area, where hoses are connected to go to an individual reactor. There are two shut-off valves located at the bottom of the tank, one at the pump, and another at the hose connection. A 2 inch discharge line from the tank is also used for filling 300 gallon totes. Transfers from trucks are done through a 2 inch up pipe on the storage tank and displaced vapors are vented through a caustic scrubber. The tank is kept at atmospheric pressure.  The tank has recently been upgraded with heat-tracing and insulation.",

The safety and health of our employees is our number one priority at the plant, followed closely by the health and safety of our neighbors and the protection of the environment.\n\nTo minimize any risk to people and environment Channel follows state and federal guidelines in the storage and handling of these chemicals. Channel spill prevention policies include plant inspections every working shift, securing valves on storage vessels, and continual visual monitoring during the transfer of all chemicals. The company also maintains written emergency response plans in the event that there is a spill or accidental release. The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nChannel Chemical Corporation is located in the Bernard Bayou Industrial park in Harrison County, Mississippi. The company is located on an 11-acre parcel of land stretching between Seaway Road and Bernard Bayou. \n\nChannel Chemical is a toll manufacturer--which means it manufactures products for its customers, but produces no products of its own. The majority of the 20 different chemical products manufactured at the facility are for the oil field industry. In the process of producing these chemical products the company receives and ships a variety of chemicals in 55-gallon drums, IBC totes, and tank trucks.\n\nHowever, Channel handles only one chemical in quantities that are considered hazardous (above threshold limits) according to the List of Regulated Toxic Substances of 40CFR part 68.130. This chemical is Formaldehyde Solution. The facility receives a tank truck of Formaldehyde Solution (4,900 gallons) an average of twice a month.  Channel stores a maximum of 5,000 gallons of the Solution in a bulk s"

It also stores two or three back up totes (300 gallons each) of the solution.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThis manufacturing facility is in compliance with state and federal laws and programs concerning the prevention of chemical spills including SWPPP, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and OSHA's Process Safety Management rules. In addition, operators are well versed in the proper handling and monitoring of Formaldehyde Solution whenever it is used in a manufacturing process. All of Channel's employees receive regular training in spill prevention and spill clean up.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nAccording to the requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program, Formaldehyde Solution is the only chemical on Channel's plant site that falls within the parameters of this Risk Management Plan--meaning that the chemical is on the Hazardous Chemical List (CAA 112(r)), and that Channel stores it in a quantity above the List's \"Threshold Quantity.\"   There has been no accidental release related to Formaldehyde Solution in the past five years, and there hasn't been an accidental release of any other chemical in the past five years either.\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nChannel's Emergency Response Program is based on taking all actions necessary to reduce the threat of exposure to its employees, surrounding neighbors and to the environment.  Included in these efforts:\n--Regular updates to the local fire department and local emergency response department that include an updated list of chemicals stored on Channel's site, an updated map of where the chemicals are stored, and a copy of any MSDS's for new chemicals stored on site.\n--Channel also tries to take representatives of the local fire department on tour of the plant whenever practical, and whenever requested by the local fire departments. This allows the department personnel to become familiar"

It also allows Channel to get feedback from the fire department on improvements it might make to make the plant site safer or more accessible to emergency personnel. The last tour by a fire department representative was October 2009.  In addition, the fire department also trains Channel employees in the correct use of fire extinguishers on the plant site.\n--Channel employees go through regular safety training and emergency policies and procedures. Personnel also go through drills including what to do when an employee is injured and when/how to evacuate the plant in an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n--Channel will continue to bring in outside trainers to update employees on proper precautions and procedures related to personal safety and the safety of others and the environment.\n--Channel is investigating the merits of adding cameras, monitors, and alarms that will help ensure the safety of the employees and the environment."
