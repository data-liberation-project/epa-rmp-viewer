The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nGeorgia title III is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. constantly strives to improve the safety of the processes at the Memphis facility through both the incident investigation program and the safety committee. We will continue to train employees in the operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed."
