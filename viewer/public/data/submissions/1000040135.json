      "SummaryText": "This is an executive summary:\n\nThe policies, procedures and activities for compliance with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements, Risk Management Programs under section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, 40 CFR 68.79, for Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation's Redtail Gas Plant.\n\nLocation: \n\nThe Redtail Gas Plant is located in Weld County, Colorado approximately fifteen and a half (15.5) miles North of New Raymer, Colorado on county road 127.  The facility operates at the intersection of CR 127 and CR 116 and has a legal location indicated as the Section 21, Township 10N, Range 58W.\n\nProcess Description:\n\nThe natural gas delivered from production wells to the inlet of Redtail Gas Plant is designed for 20 MMSCFD. Redtail gas plant is designed to remove Natural Gas Liquids (NGL's) from rich natural gas.  Natural gas at Redtail is gathered in a low-pressure pipeline system with a Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure (MAOP) of 75 psig.  Saturated Natural gas at approximately 10 psig enters the plant through three main pipelines. The three lines then combine into a 20\" inlet header.  The inlet gas stream flows through inlet valves, that are shutdown valves that will fail closed during an ESD and prevent gas from entering the plant. The gas flows to a slug catcher that removes water. The gas exiting the vessel flows through a 20\" main suction header to three reciprocating compressors.  The three main compressors are equipped with 4 stages, where stages 1 through 3 are dedicated to increasing the pressure for the NGL extraction process. The 4th stage is dedicated to moving sales residue spec natural gas through the coalescing filter and CO2 membrane to the plant outlet into the 8\" Tall grass pipeline. From 3rd stage compression, natural gas enters the 3-Phase Separator.  The vessel is a horizontal Gas-Liquid-Liquid Separator with a Water Boot that removes water from the natural gas stream. The gas stream flows to the NGL Processing/De-Ethanizer Tower. The i"

      "SummaryText": "nlet Gas flows through the tube side exchanger while propane from the Propane Economizer is chilling the shell side through the process of refrigeration. Lean Glycol is added into the gas stream as it enters the Gas Chiller to help prevent freezing. Redtail Gas plant recovers NGL's by using a closed-loop Propane Refrigeration cycle. Propane vapors are first compressed in the three AJAX refrigeration compressors. The De-Ethanizer Tower Feed boils and separates through different levels of trays. The Y-Grade at the bottom of the De-Ethanizer tower is routed through the cooler and to Y-Grade Storage Tanks. Whiting anticipates the potential for additional production with plant expansions in the future. \n\nProgram Level:\n\nIt has been determined that this is a Program 3 facility.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the range of the worst case release scenario.  This facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\nPrevention and Response Policies:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are provided in the facility's Process Safety Management Guidelines manual.  The plant's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Weld County Local Emergency Planning Committee(LEPC) and agency personnel will have a chance to tour the facility.  Whiting Oil and Gas Corpation takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facility by ensuring that employees are trained in the safe operation of the plant and evacuation procedures.  \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances: \n\nThe facility contains a simple NGL product storage and shipping process.  Butane, propane and pentane are the primary components of the NGL inventory listed in the RMP rule.  As there is no specific chemical classification for hexanes+, all of the potential hexanes have been grouped in with the pentanes for the purpose of this analysis. The tanks will all store Y-grade with no a"

All of the chemicals above the RMP threshold are classified as flammable and not toxic. As such, only a flammable release scenario has been analyzed for the Redtail Gas Plant.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe worst case release scenario is that one of the four 90,000 gallon NGL tanks and associated piping is ruptured and released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  In the event of a catastrophic release and subsequent explosion, all of the tanks could be compromised given there close proximity and linked piping components.  However, per the RMP rules, it is assumed that the maximum volume that could potentially be involved in a vapor cloud explosion is the total volume associated with one of the NGL tank vessels. No active mitigation or passive mitigation was considered in limiting the NGL tank volume.  Worst case meteorological conditions are assumed and RMP*Comp was used to calculate the endpoint distance for overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (PSI) for a flammable mixture vapor cloud explosion.   A distance of 0.6 miles to the overpressure endpoint of 1 PSIG was determined for a release of 404,238 pounds in ten minutes for the entire NGL process.  There is no potential public receptor within this radial distance about 0.6 miles of the farcicality.  There are no other environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nAlternate-Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe alternative release scenario is that one of the 90,000 gallon Y-grade tanks and associated piping is compromised and released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  It is assumed that the tank is only 50% full, thus, it is limited to 45,000 gallons of Y-grade product that could potentially be involved in the vapor cloud explosion, in addition to any associated piping liquids.  The active mitigation considered is that"

The plan is designed to protect personnel on the site, to ensure their safe and orderly evacuation in event of an emergency, and to provide notification, appropriate information and protection for response personnel.\n\n"
