The same properties that make this chemical valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system to control human environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to workers as well as the surrounding communities.\r\n\r\nIt is Bellisio Foods' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations.  However, the safe handling of ammonia is paramount.  Standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of ammonia are used to ensure that a reasonable level of risk reduction is maintained.  Investigation of inherently safer technologies, and failsafe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements being studied.  Safety depends upon management commitment, the manner in which ammonia refrigerant is handled, the safety devices inherent to the refrigeration system design, operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of refrigeration technicians.\r\n\r\nBellisio Foods believes that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management.  Senior management's commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment.  \r\n\r\nExtensive improvements have been made to safety and health programs like the prevention program (process safety and risk management), emergency preparedness and response, and t"

This is known as employee ownership and its success is portrayed through lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved efficiencies at the plant.\r\n \r\nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually tornadoes, heavy snowstorms, or conditions that are reasonably predictable.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of onsite emergencies such as a spill, fire/explosion, or a chemical release.  As a responsible company, Bellisio Foods coordinates emergency response activities and training with the local emergency management organizations.  This ensures prompt mitigation actions during incidents.\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nBellisio Foods is a large domestic producer of processed foods that include Michelina's and Yu Sing food products.  The Jackson, Ohio plant site covers approximately 585,000 square feet (13.4 acres) within the Jackson City limits.  It is located at 100 East Broadway Street in Jackson, Ohio in Jackson County.\r\n\r\nThere are approximately 900 employees at the plant site, which are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers union organization.\r\n\r\nOnly one chemical covered by 40 CFR Part 68 is inventoried at the plant site.  This substance is present in quantities greater than the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore is included in our risk management program.\r\n\r\nAmmonia (anhydrous)- Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the plant.  It is received into the plant by truck, however deliveries of ammonia are infrequent.  One of the primary refrigeration vessels is the High Pressure Receiver vessel in Plant A. This vessel has a maximum inventory of 15,000 pounds that is controlled through administrative procedures.  There are three (3) refrigeration systems at the"

This prevention program was designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects.  The primary objective of the prevention program is to ensure complete containment of ammonia through safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\r\n \r\nBellisio Foods has completed revalidation of their process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the ammonia refrigeration systems.  Revalidations were conducted in May 2009.  The recommendations generated during this review were prioritized using a standardized Risk Rank Matrix method.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nBellisio Foods has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process.  This process is defined and explained in the prevention program procedures.  Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance is experienced.\r\n\r\nIndividuals knowledgeable in refrigeration operation or the equipment being investigated lead formal incident investigations.  Root cause and corrective actions are determined and formal reports are prepared.  Progress regarding corrective action on all investigated incidents is tracked through final resolution.\r\n\r\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines accident as the following:\r\n\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\r\n\u00bf\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\r\n\r\nThere have been no events at any of the three processes that meet th"

The emergency response plan is a vital part of the overall prevention program.  Bellisio Foods continues its preparedness for the unplanned ammonia release while striving to adhere to the latest mechanical integrity and inherently safer technologies.\r\n\r\nPlanned Improvements to Reduce Risk\r\n\r\nIn accordance with its risk management program, Bellisio Foods conducts continuous self-examination evaluations designed to identify and assess process/operational risk for employees and the community.  One of the primary aspects of the risk management program is the empowerment of each employee with the responsibility for continuous safe operations.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration employs a programmable logic controller as a means to control ammonia emissions and inadvertent ammonia releases to the atmosphere.  An audio, visual, olfactory leak detection and repair program that requires multiple checks per day will control refrigeration system emissions.  In addition, ammonia detectors are strategically located throughout the machine rooms to quickly detect any releases."
