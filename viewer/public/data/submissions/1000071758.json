      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - SILOAM NGL FACILITY\n\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C (MarkWest), owner and operator of the Siloam NGL Facility in Southshore, Kentucky, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses processing, storage, and wholesale distribution of various liquified petroleum gases (LPGs).  The following LPGs are present at the facility: propane, normal butane, isobutane, natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes), and mixed feed natural gas liquids (a combination of all the previously mentioned LPGs commonly referred to as Y-grade).  Ethyl Mercaptan is also stored at this facility. All of these substances are regulated due to their flammable and explosive nature. The determination of quantities calculations are available upon request.\n\n\n\nThe facility receives the mixed feed Y-grade from pipeline, tank truck, and rail car.  The Y-grade is stored in above ground vessels and then processed at the facility into propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline.  These products are stored in both above ground vessels and also, in the case of propane, in underground caverns.\n\n\n\nThese products are then distributed from the facility by tank truck, rail car, and, in the case of normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline, by barge.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case accident scenario was determined by looking at several scenarios and determining which would have the greatest off"

      "SummaryText": "-site impact.  The three scenarios chosen were the release of the entire contents of an 8,000,000 gallon propane cavern, the release of the entire contents of a 3,000,000 gallon propane cavern, and the release of the entire contents of a 438,136 gallon natural gasoline tank.  Modeling using the RMP-COMP model shows the worst-case scenario is the release from the 8,000,000 gallon propane storage cavern.  Administrative controls limit the volume of the cavern to 80% of capacity, therefore, the release was modeled at 80% of capacity with specific weight for propane.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario was considered as a rail car transfer hose rupturing during propane transfer operations.  To be conservative it was assumed the flow would be unabated for five minutes until the valves could shut and flow ceased.  At a flow of 1,000 gallons/minute this would cause the release of approximately 5,000 gallons of propane.  Using the density of propane this amounts to a release of 21,150 pounds of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nMarkWest keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to p"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nMarkWest will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major proc"
