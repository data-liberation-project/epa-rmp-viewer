Inc - Portsmouth is complying with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulation, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations, (CFR) 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulations, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  These Regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In complying, we promote overall facility, employee and public safety.  Smithfield's program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness or death and to avoid the potential for property and environmental impact.  \n\nSmithfield's safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage handling or the on-site movement of chemicals.  Any groups of vessels interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.   Smithfield's has a policy and commitment to employee safety and it is expressed in all programs and training. \n\nSmithfield's safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on rules, procedures, and best practices which govern processes, activities, and/or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and revised as necessary; all information is communicated to employees of Smithfield through training and documentation.  The safety equipment used for HAZ-MAT purposes is inspected monthly and records are retained in the Refrigeration Supervisors office.  \n\nSmithfield is a processing and packaging company u"

Smithfield has an on-site trained emergency response team (HAZMAT) and maintains a written emergency response plan which is reviewed annually.  This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Fire Department, Police and Emergency Medical facilities to ensure communication with all potential or actual involved resources should their involvement be necessitated by a release. \n\nThrough Process Hazard Analysis, inspections, annual reviews and audits, Smithfield continuously improves its process system, procedures, programs and training to ensure mitigation, control, technology, equipment and organizational changes remain consistent and in force. Through this initiative, Smithfield can ensure the utmost safeguards are utilized as it related to its process systems and programs for the overall safety and well being of the employees, facility and the environment."
