      "SummaryText": "Fehrer Automotive (Fehrer) operates the Gadsden, Alabama manufacturing facility to produce polyurethane foam seat cushions for the automotive industry. The foam is made by high pressure mixing of chemicals as they are poured into a mold that is attached by carrier to a continuously moving line which then moves the mold through a curing oven. Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, trimmed and prepared for shipment to customers.  Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam. TDI is received at the plant by tank trailer, and is stored in 2 tanks located in the tank farm. The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled piping delivery system.  As a result of the storage and use of TDI, Fehrer must comply with the Chemical Accident Prevention rule issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required for the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe Gadsden manufacturing facility has the potential to store approximately 140,000 pounds of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) at any given time.  The TDI is stored in two separate vertical storage tanks with capacity for 7925 gallons (30 m3) each inside the main manufacturing building in a tank farm with secondary containment.   \n\n\n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n \n\nFehrer is fully committed to compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding the proper handling, use, storage, and emergency response preparedness to prevent accidental release of chemicals, toxic or otherwise.  Furthermore, Fehrer is committed to protecting the health and welfare of its employees, the community, as well as the environment. \n\n \n\nOur emergency response program is based on the requirements in OSHA's Hazardous Waste and Emergency Operations (HAZWOPER) regulation (29 CFR 1910.120) and both s"

In case of serious release beyond the ability of the facility's emergency response team to control and remediate, it is the company's policy to immediately notify the City of Gadsden Fire Department by calling 911 and other parties in accordance with the Facility Emergency Response Plan.     \n\n\n\n2.0    Site Information\n\nThe Fehrer Automotive facility is located at 4330 Brooke Ave., Gadsden, AL.  The physical location is 33?99'68.81\" N and -86?07'56.87\" W at an elevation of 603 feet above sea level.  The site is located on 18.7 acres with a primary building of 238,620 square feet and a secondary storage building with 3,150 square feet.  The Gadsden manufacturing facility has the potential to store approximately 140,000 pounds of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) at any given time.

The primary two diisocyanates and their related polyisocyanates utilized by Fehrer Automotive in the US are MDI and TDI with TDI currently listed as a regulated chemical under the EPA's Risk Management Program rule. These chemicals have unique properties and functional versatility, and contain free isocyanate functional groups (-N=C=O).  When isocyanates are combined with other compounds that contain free hydroxyl functional groups (i.e. -OH) they react and begin to form polyurethane polymers.  This chemical reaction is completed when all of the initially free -N=C=O groups are bound within the polymer network. This process is commonly referred to as \"curing.\"  Products that contain"

Using an EPA approved model, Phast Risk, the results of the offsite consequence analysis estimated the distance to the toxic endpoint to be 574 feet or roughly 0.1 mile.

The EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document also indicates that TDI will have a neutrally buoyant plume.\n\n\n\nFehrer Automotive has modeled the required alternate worst-case release scenario as a total release of one storage tank with an approximate weight of 70,000 pounds of TDI to a secondary containment area encompassing the interior tank farm.
