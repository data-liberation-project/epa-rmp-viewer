PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.  Process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures address various operating phases, such as the following:  (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdowns, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  Operating procedures are available to all employees who work in or maintain a process, and the operating procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  \n\nOperator Training\n\nThe operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The operator training includes information related to unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions, including shutdown.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training.  Operator training is required to be documented.\n\nContractors\n\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator.   The contractor selection process is based on a variety of data, such as contractor provided contractor safety programs and contractor performance information.  Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics.    \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR procedure is in place and requires a PSSR be conducted for any new facility or"

The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions, nor allow credit for existing mitigation measures that have been identified.  Based on the review conducted when preparing this executive summary, the ARS is considered a more realistic scenario and takes into account actual operating conditions.\n\nThe following are summaries of the toxic and flammable WCS and ARS modeling at NCP \u00bf East Site.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (USEPA) RMP*Comp Version 1.07 off-site consequence analysis program.  Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, BUREAU OF THE CENSUS LandView\u00ae VI Environmental Mapping Software (2003).\n\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for the consideration of mitigation measures in WCS modeling, various prevention measures that are in place should reduce the likelihood of the WCS and its impacts should it occur.  These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n-  Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs;\n-  Routine surveillance by trained operators;\n-  Various audible and visual alarm and notification systems;\n-  Responder call-out, incident command establishment and staging, and agency notification, as necessary.\n\n1. Toxic Worst-Case Release Scenario \u00bf Chlorine\n\nThe worst-case scenario is an instantaneous failure of a set of 6 one-ton chlorine cylinders that results in a release of 12,000 lbs of chlorine over a 10 minute period.

A population estimate of 13,030 people off-site, including residential, religious, recreational, school and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release.  Bayou Trepagnier, a designated scenic stream adjacent to the northern side of the facility, may also be impacted. \n\n2. Toxic Alternative Release Scenario \u00bf Chlorine\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of a 9/16\u00bf fusible plug on a one-ton chlorine cylinder.  The fusible plug is assumed to fail on the liquid side of the cylinder and was estimated to empty the cylinder contents in approximately 10 minutes although operator surveillance allows for detection and intervention within 3-5 minutes.  No passive (i.e. containment) mitigations were applied to the release model calculation even though area firewater monitors would be activated to apply water to the release.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas.  This scenario was selected because of a 1998 incident in the industry which involved a fusible plug failure on the vapor side of a chlorine cylinder.  The endpoint distance was calculated at 0.3 miles (1,584 ft).  A population estimate of 210 people off-site, primarily located in residential areas, could be potentially affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified.\n\n3. Flammable Worst-Case Release Scenario \u00bf Flammable Mixture\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a flammable release assumes the instantaneous failure, release, and vapor cloud explosion of 8,000,000 lbs of a flammable mixture (butane, 1,3-butadiene, isopentane, and pentane) from a process vessel in the OL-5 process.  Although the vessel normally operates with liquid filled to 50% capacity, there are no procedures to regulate inventory.  Therefo"

Bayou Trepagnier, a designated scenic stream adjacent to the northern side of the facility, may also be impacted. \n\n4. Flammable Alternative Release Scenario \u00bf Propylene\n\nThe alternative flammable scenario involves the release of 40,000 lbs of propylene and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion resulting from a valve stem blowout on a 48\u00bf power assisted check valve downstream of a propylene compressor.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas.  The modeling scenario also assumes a 5 minute release duration before the explosion occurs.  This scenario was selected because of a 1997 incident in the industry involving a similar event in an identical process.  It is assumed that release detection would be immediate due to the noise generated by a high pressure release.  Operator intervention is assumed to deactivate the compressor to stop the flow of propylene, as well as activate area firewater monitors to contain any fire and cool equipment.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 0.2 miles (1,056 ft).  No off-site consequences are associated with this release."
