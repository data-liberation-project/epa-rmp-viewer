      "SummaryText": "Super Cool Cold Storage, Inc. is a complex of four (4) freezer warehouse buildings, designated #1-#4, used for temporary freezer storage of food grade items destined for truck transport to retail outlets. The refrigerant used to cool the freezer is ammonia. Ammonia is a hazardous substance (toxic) and its use in large quanties in industries is regulated by the EPA. Super Cool #4 maintains a system that contains 28,145 lbs. which exceeds the OSHA and EPA mandated threshold of 10,000 lbs. for ammonia. Therefore, Super Cool is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and many of the RMP requirements were met in coming into compliance with PSM.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies-\nSuper Cool policy demands a proactive approach to equipment maintenance. Equipment failure is the primary hazard facing a refrigerated storage facility. Frequent monitoring of equipment reduces the chances of an accidental release. Super Cool uses a rigorous inspection program to ensure that equipment is functioning properly and pays close attention to routine equipment maintenance. Super Cool employs only 2-3 people to work on the refrigeration process. Much of the equipment maintenance is performed by licensed contracting companies.\n\nSuper Cool refrigeration employees have received \"Hazardous Materials Technician\" & \"First Responder\" training and they are annually refreshed in the event of a release. The Emergency Response (ER) Plan includes notification of potentially affected neighbors. Super Cool extends thier rigorous inspection/maintenance program to include emergency equipment as well.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Scenario or Accidental Release-\nThe worst- case release scenario will emanate from SC #4. An EPA model was used in which the release occurs in the outdoor high pressure receiver and then migrates to the surronding community. Should a major refrigeration line be significantly damaged or a major piece of equipment seriously"

      "SummaryText": " malfuntion and all 4220 lbs of ammonia are released from this systems largest vessel, an area within approximately1.30 miles of the facility could potentially be affected.\n\nA much more likely scenario involves a lifting safety relief valve from SC#4 that requires 10 minutes to stop. This release was also modelled using EPA guidence. This particular type of release would be expected to travel approximately 0.2 miles from the source.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps-\nSuper Cool adheres to 29 CFR1910.119 (OSHA's PSM regulation) and thoroughly documents inspections and maintenance procedures. All super Cool refrigeration employees are trained per the requirments of 29 CFR1910.120 and training is refreshed annually.\n\nEmergency Response Plan-\nSuper Cool has coordinated its ER plan with the local ER authority (Central Florida LEPC) and the Polk County Fire Department & Hazmat Team (PCFDHM). The PCFDHM  conducted a full dress rehearsal of a mock emergency response in June 1998 in order to aquaint themselves with the facility should a ER action ever be required. the local Police/Fire authorities will assist in notification of nearby citizenry in the event of a catastrophic release.\n\nSuper Cool conducts monthly inspections of their Emergency Response Equipment to ensure that cartridges and/or supplied air, etc. has not expired or malfuntioning.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety-\nSuper Cool plans to install automatic ammonia leak monitors to improve their leak detection capabilities."
