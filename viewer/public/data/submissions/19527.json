      "SummaryText": "The City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities uses propane at its Natural Gas Peak Shaving Plant.  This chemical is classified as extremely hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Propane, like all volatile liquids and vapors containing hydrocarbons, is dangerous and improper or careless handling can result in fire or explosion; therefore it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees, the members of our community and the environment.  The City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities is committed to complying with all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations, thereby reducing the risk to our employees and the public.\n\nIn the natural gas industry, the term \"peak shaving\" refers to the introduction of a propane/air mixture into the natrual gas distribution system on extremely high (peak) usage days.  A peak shaving plant is a facility that blends and injects this propane/air mixture into the natural gas distribution system to supplement the volume of natural gas received from suppliers.  When natural gas volume requirements for the Gallatin Natural Gas System are greater than the maximum quantity of natural gas that the supplier is required to sell and deliver (referred to as MDQ).  The peak shaving plant is then activated to reduce the \"peak\" demand, thus avoiding costly overrun penalty charges.\n\nThe Gallatin Peak Shaving Plant is located at 110 Municipal Park Drive, at the intersection of Albert Gallatin Drive and North Water Avenue.  This facility consists of six (6) 30,000 gallon propane tanks, a vaporizer/injection building, and unloading facilities.  Operational procedures limit the maximum content of the propane tanks to approximately eighty-five percent (85%), with a maximum of 153,000 gallons of propane stored at this facility.\n\nOff-site consequence analysis have been conducted to determine the potential impacts of a propane release at the peak shaving plant.

      "SummaryText": "site consequence analysis considers two propane release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\".  A \"worst case release scenario\" is defined as one that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint from an accidental release of a regulated substance from a covered process under worst case conditions.  The \"worst case scenario\" for the Gallatin Peak Shaving Plant involves the release of the entire contents (approximately 25,500 gallons) of a propane storage tank.  It is assumed that the contents are released as vapor which finds an inigition source.  The off-site consequence analysis was performed using RMPComp, an EPA computer-modeling program, which uses EPA defined release conditions and user data to determine the distance to an endpoint.  RMPComp calculated the distance to the endpoint (1psi overpressure) for the \"worst case scenario\" at this facility to be 0.4 miles with an estimated affected population of 719 persons.  An \"alternative release scenario\" is defined as one that will reach an endpoint off-site and is more likely to occur than the \"worst case release scenario\".  Several \"alternative release scenarios\" were analyzed for this facility, all of which resulted in an endpoint of less than 0.10 miles and an estimated affected population of 45 persons.\n\nThe City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities emphasizes the intergration of standard operating procedures, technology and management procedures at all facilities to control the risks associated with the use of hazardous chemicals.  The safety features inherent in the design and operation of a peak shaving plant combined with the training of our personnel promotes the safe handling and use of propane.  In fact, we have not had an accidental release of propane in the past five years.  An emergency response plan, which addresses accidental propane releases, has been prepared for the Gallatin Peak Shaving Plant and is a pa"

This emergency response plan was developed using guidance from the American Gas Association, the National Fire Prevention Association, the National Response Team's Integrated Contigency Plan, and the EPA.  The plan is being  coordinated with the Gallatin Fire Department and the Sumner County Emergency Management Agency; and includes procedures for public notification, personal protective equipment, first aid, and incident investigation.  Also, the City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities has developed a Hazardous Incident Response Team to respond to chemical releases and other emergency situations at its facilities.\n\nThe City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities is committed to the safe operation of our facilities and encourages the input of our employees and our community."
