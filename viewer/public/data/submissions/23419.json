The Risk Management Program (RMP) meets and addresses the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n \nThe five-year accident history.\n \nThe emergency response program.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.  \n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Wells Dairy, Inc. (WDI) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of the WDI's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, WDI is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated s"

      "SummaryText": "ubstances handled\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the WDI Le Mars facility refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the air units, shell and tube chillers or the CO2 Liquefying systems where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nThe \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm.  The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and majority of the piping are inside the Le Mars facility's building.  A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place. These include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nStandard Operating Procedures\nSafework Practices\nEmployee and Operator Training Programs\nMechanical Integrity Program\nManagement of Chance Procedures\nPSM Compliance Audit Procedures\nIncident Investigation Procedures\nEmployee Participation Program\nHot Work Permit Procedures\nContractor Safety Program\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAmmonia specific prevention steps include:\n\nAdministrative controls\nOperator Training\nComputerized controls\n\nThe Preventive Program 3 provides an extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure the systems mechanical integrity is maintained for the"

Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system)., so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\nThe five-year accident history\n\nA five year accident history has been prepared and included in the RMP since there have been two reportable incidents within the last 5 years.  One could be classified as a major release even though there were no significant off-site impacts. The other was a relative minor one, which was quickly contained. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Wells Dairy, Inc. is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\nAs a result of the major incident, the following changes were introduced to prevent a recurrence:\n\nImproved and upgraded equipment\nRevised maintenance procedures\nRevised Training Programs\nNew process controls\nNew mitigation systems\nRevised Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe emergency response program\n\n Emergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.  Wells Dairy, Inc. has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  WDI conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nWells Dairy; Inc.  is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, incident investigations and program audits.  The flexibil"

      "SummaryText": "ity of the program allows WDI to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing WDI employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, the specific changes made as a result of the incident (detailed above), improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
