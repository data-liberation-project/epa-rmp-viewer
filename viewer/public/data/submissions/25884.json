      "SummaryText": "\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe BP Amoco Texas City Chemical Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Amoco Texas City Chemical Plant is located at 2800 FM 519 East, Texas City Texas 77590.  The plant is owned by BP-Amoco PLC.   The plant produces 4.5 billion pounds a year of petrochemical products including paraxylene, metaxylene, polybutene, polymer and chemical grade propylene, and styrene monomer.  The plant contains nine operating units and three support units all of which are covered under the RMP rule.  Of these process units, five of them qualify for Program 3 coverage. Five covered processes contain  regulated flammable mixtures held above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.   The flammable mixtures contain  various regulated substances such as but not limited to propane, propylene, butane, butene, ethylchloride, and ethylene.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to calculate worst case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated substance on-site.  The purpose in calculating these types of scenarios is to encourage community dialogue on chemical accident prevention and risk reduction.  The BP Amoco Texas City Chemical Plant has performed these calculations using the methodology given in the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guida"

The results of these calculations have been provided to the EPA and to the Texas City/LaMarque LEPC, and have been shared with members of the local community.\n\nThe likelihood of these types of events is extremely remote.  The BP Amoco Texas City Chemical Plant employs many layers of protection to reduce risk and to prevent chemical accidents.\n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a flammable substance would be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from an instantaneous failure of a propylene storage vessel.  In calculating the potential impact zone, no credit was taken for administrative controls, or mitigation systems.  The impact zone from such an event would extend beyond the boundaries of the plant.\n\nFlammable Alternative Release Scenario:\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for a flammable substance is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from a release of propylene.  The impact zone from such an event would extend beyond the boundaries of the plant. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nFollowing is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Texas City, Texas plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Texas City, Texas chemical plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee partici"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Texas City, Texas plant exclusively uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \nThe PHA team findings are reviewed by management for resolution.  A written action plan is generated by management assigning responsibility and determining an expected completion date for each recommendation made during the HAZOP study.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked in an electronic database until they are complete.
