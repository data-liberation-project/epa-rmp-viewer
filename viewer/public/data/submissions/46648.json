If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Bethel Township Fire Department and the Delaware County LEPC, as appropriate throught the 911 Service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of Concord 59 and Talleyville 25 (both Basic Life Support Units) or Medic 104 (Advanced Life Support unit) via 911 for ambulance service.  The primary hospital response is provided through Crozier Chester Medical Center with support through Riddle Hospital.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response teams to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Laurel Pipe Line Company, L.P.- Booth Station is a refined product pipeline breakout station, including the butane blending system (direct injection into the pipelines).  The Risk Management Plan covers the butane blending system including three 60,000 gallon vessels and the associated piping, blending skid, two sampling units, and two truck off-loading points.\n\nThe Facility's worst case scenerio is the complete failure of the systems manifolded liquified butane vessels filled to 85% capacity (automatic shut-off limited) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site to a distance of 0.7 miles and includes both public and environmental receptors.  The Facility's alternate (most-likely) scenerio is a truck \"pull-away\" incident resulting in a one minute pipe/hose release and vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site, but affects only environmental receptors.\n\nThe Laurel Pipe Line Company, L.P.- Booth Station complies with the U"

Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor- Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).  This butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained to meet of exceed the NFPA #58 requirements for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage.\n\nTo date, this Facility has never had an accident or incident involving the butane blending system (new process) resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Booth Station butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Bethel Township Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility maintains a trained (annual) incipient fire and hazardous material response team, as referenced above.  The Facility's Emergency Response Plans are coordinated with the Bethel Township Fire Department and the Delaware County LEPC.  The Bethel County Fire Department is aware of the Facility's butane blending system.  Fire Deparment access is via Garnet Mine Road.  Available fire protection includes a Facility deluge system (5 foam monitors), nine hydrants, and portable (20 lb.) dry chemical fire extinguishers.  The Booth Station maintains a vegetation control plan to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the butane vessels."
