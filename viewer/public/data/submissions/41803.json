              "Description": "This Prevention Program incorporates, by this reference, the OSHA PSM program titled \"Process Safety Management Plan.\"  Southwest Storage & Distribution recognizes the difference between the two programs.  That is, EPA's mandate is protection of the general public while OSHA's is protection of employee safety and health.  In other words, EPA's authority is offsite, while OSHA's in onsite.  As a practical matter, here at Southwest Storage & Distribution, the two programs dovetail well.  That is, measures described to prevent accidents that could expose employees to ammonia would also prevent a release that could have effects offsite.  Differences exist in terminology and regulatory reerences.  These differences are set forth in the Prevention Program document.",

If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our emergency response procedure and to notify the Phoenix Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Emergency evacuation in the community would be coordinated through the Phoenix Fire Department.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThis facility is a cold storage facility and distribution warehouse.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the operation.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst-case release scenario is failure of the 6000 pound ammonia receiver resulting in the release of all the contents over a ten-minute period.  According to the EPA's RMPComp model, the distance to the endpoint is 1.0 miles.  Some outlying areas of Phoenix are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's PSM rules, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations."
