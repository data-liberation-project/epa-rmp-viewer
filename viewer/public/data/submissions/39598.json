Phibro-Tech, Inc. recycles spent materials nationwide through a network of four Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)-permitted plants, located in California, Illinois, South Carolina, and Texas.\n\nPhibro-Tech, Inc.?s Joliet Facility has been a chemical processing plant since 1972.  The 1.6 acre Facility is currently receiving non-ignitable, non-reactive metal bearing inorganic wastes to be recycled on-site or transferred to other facilities.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in the recycling processes.  All wastes received are stored in permitted hazardous waste containers and tanks.  The hazardous waste management units at the Facility consist of the following:\n\n- Two indoor container storage areas, one in the East Warehouse and one in the West Warehouse, where wastes are stored prior to being processed.\n- Two existing tank storage areas.  There are twelve tanks in Tank Storage Area #1 and one in Tank Storage Area #2.                            \nThe Plant Manager is responsible for day-to-day operations at the Facility.  The Plant Manager?s duties include: managing personnel requirements, scheduling and coordinating plant production and material flow, developing job safety practices, ensuring day-to-day compliance with all applicable regulations and permits, maintaining all required documents and records, and implementing and coordinating Contingency Plan procedures.  The Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) Manager position includes developing and implementing management systems and programs to support operations at the site; duties include developing policies and procedures, conducting compliance audits and inspections, preparing and presenting training programs, consulting to the company's sale personnel, consult and support management projects on design, construction and modifi"

Joliet Facility conducts routine inspections of the facility with emphasis placed on maintaining operational effectiveness of monitoring, safety, security, and structural equipment.  These inspections are conducted in order to protect against the release of hazardous waste, which may threaten human health and/or the environment.  The ?Facility Inspection Schedule?  identifies aspects of the facility, which directly or indirectly affect hazardous waste management operations and therefore require routine inspection and maintenance.  In addition, the facility inspection schedule identifies the inspection frequency and the types of possible deficiencies that may be encountered.\n\nThe Joliet Facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Program for Ammonia (anhydrous).   \n\nThe Joliet Facility does not accept waste streams containing organics, ignitable or reactive wastes.  After laboratory analysis is performed a Facility Waste Type Code is assigned to each container, truck, or tank car shipment.  The Facility Waste Type Code determines movement of the container to either the east or west warehouse storage areas or transfer of the waste to a specific hazardous waste storage tanks.  Containers of incompatible waste will not be stored within the same warehouse.  Incompatible wastes will not be transferred to tanks within the same secondary containment structure.\n\nThe current RCRA Part B Permit requires the facility to implement the contingency plan when the outside monitors register more than 50 ppm for ammonia. The facility no longer receives shipments of liquid chlorine in bulk.\n\nMost releases of hazardous waste would be expected to be minor (less than one drum) and could be cleaned up with dry absorbent materials; a neutralizing agent; and/or manually collected by pumping liquids from the floor trench or picking up solids.

Initial training for routine handlers of hazardous wastes consists of 24 hours duration to enable employees to perform their duties in a safe and healthful manner.  All employees receive a minimum of 8 hours of refresher training annually thereafter.  Emergency response training includes all of the following components:\n\n?Hazard Recognition\n?Method of Minimizing Risks\n?Proper Use of Control and Personnel Protective Equipment\n?Proper Operating Procedures at Incident Scenes\n?Coordination with Other Employees\n?Response to Overexposure or Injury\n?Elements of the Facility Emergency Response Plan\n?Standard Operating Procedures.\n\nIf the emergency coordinator determines that a release, fire, or explosion could occur or has occurred which threatens human health or the environment beyond the facility boundaries, the emergency coordinator shall:\n\n1) Immediately call 911 and notify appropriate local police and fire departments that evacuation of local areas may be advisable. The emergency coordinator shall assist officials in determining areas, which should be evacuated.\n\n2) Immediately notify the National Response Center at (800) 424-8802.\n\n3) Immediately notify the Illinois Emergency Management Agency at (217) 782-7860.\n\n4) Immediately notify the Will County Emergency Management Agency at (815) 740-8351.\n\n5) Immediately notify the Illinois EPA  at (217) 782-3637.\n\nWhen notifying the above parties, the emergency coordinator will report the following minimum information:\n\n1) Name and telephone number of reporter;\n\n2) Name and address of facility;\n\n3) Time and type of incident (e.g., release, fire);\n\n4) Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known;\n\n5) The extent of injuries, if any;\n\n6) The possible hazards to human health, or the "

The primary method is on-site observation through the use of routine security patrols throughout the facility.  On-site personnel, who are responsible for monitoring the facility for unauthorized access, maintain security at Phibro-Tech on a day-to-day basis.  Routine inspections of the facility are conducted to ensure against unauthorized access, and to inspect chemical and hazardous waste storage and processing areas for a potential release.  In addition, ammonia monitoring devices have been installed and are designed to sound an alarm when outside monitors register more than 50 ppm for ammonia."
