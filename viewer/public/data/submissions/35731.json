Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility we produce steam and electricity.  During the manufacturing process we use anhydrous ammonia to reduce our NOx emissions, Chlorine to control micro biological levels in our cooling tower water, and Sulfur Dioxide to de-chlorinate the water we discharge to Little John Creek.   Anhydrous ammonia, Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide, in the amounts handled, are considered Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHMs) by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these products combined with the safety devices  inherent in the design of the facility.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPPER regulation (CFR 1910.120).  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials Unit.\n\n2.     The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is cogeneration of steam and electricity.  We operate a circulating fluidized bed boiler to produce high pressure steam by the combustion of coal, petroleum coke, and Tire Derived Fuel.  The steam from the boiler is used to turn a turbine generator thereby creating electricity.  The steam is condensed in a condenser by cooling water.  We control the microbiological levels in the cooling water with Chlorine.  However, we use sulfur dioxide to remove the chlorine in the cooling tower water before we discharge it to a local waterway so that the chlorine does not adversely effect organisms in the creek.\n\nNitrogen Oxides (NOx) are a by-product of combustion and are considered an atmospheric pollutant.  It is removed from our process by injecting anhydrous ammonia into"

This process reduces the plants NOx emissions by approx. 85 % - 90 %.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at this facility are anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide.  The maximum amount of these substances at this facility are:\n\nRegulated Substances                    Threshold Quantity\n95,000 pounds Anhydrous Ammonia                10,000 pounds\n4,000 pounds of chlorine                2,500 pounds\n4,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide (California only)    5,000/500 Pounds *\n\nCalifornia CalARP Threshold Quantity is 500 pounds for Sulfur Dioxide.\n\n3.    The general accident release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility complies with the Federal EPA?s Accidental release prevention plan, the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Regulation.  The design and construction of the facility comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.    Five year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of toxic gases that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the past five years.\n\n5.    The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility?s emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to respond to releases or potential releases of hazardous materials for the purpose of protecting nearby persons, the environment, or property from the effects of the release.  They have been trained to OSHA?s First Responder Operations Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Stockton Fire Department and the State Office of Emergency Services.  Periodic drills are conducted with t"

Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHA?s and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design & operating procedures.  Additional changes are evaluated as our employees and staff identify ideas via a number of employee involvement programs.   A Security and Vulnerability Assessment by an independent auditor was conducted in May of 2003.  Implementation of the resulting recommendations is progressing with upgrades scheduled for completion by December 2005."
