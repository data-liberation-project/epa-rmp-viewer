OxyChem is a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (? 68.155(a))\n\nOxyChem has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Pottstown plant.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Pottstown plant.  \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (? 68.155(b))\n\nThe OxyChem, Pottstown plant handles three (3) substances that are regulated by the RMP rule.  These substances are as follows:\n\n1.    Anhydrous Ammonia\n2.    Vinyl Acetate Monomer\n3.    Vinyl Chloride Monomer\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (? 68.155(c))\n\nThe Pottstown plant?s prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nPre-Startup Review\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation\nKey Safety Procedures\nContractors Safety Program\n\nEach of the items listed above are documented and maintained in manuals at the plant.  These manuals are routinely updated.\n\nFive-year Accident Hist"

      "SummaryText": "ory (? 68.155(d))\n\nThere was one accidental release from a covered process that resulted in a minor injury which required medical treatment.  An employee was exposed to ammonia vapors after the transfer pump seal failed.  The employee received one dose of an inhaled antibiotic as a precaution only.    \n\nEmergency Response Program (? 68.155(e))\n\nThe Pottstown plant has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (?ERT?) trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Operations Center (?EOC?).  In addition, the Pottstown plant has developed a Special Situations Plan (?SSP?) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe plant is a member of the Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Committee (?LEPC?), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (? 68.155(f))\n\nThe Pottstown plant constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.\n\nCertification Statement\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\nOriginal on Cover Letter                                                      Stacey A.
