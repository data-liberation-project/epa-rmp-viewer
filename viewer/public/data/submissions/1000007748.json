The majority of pressure relief valve releases in the company have been on evaporative condenser and is the reason for choosing this scenario.  The pressure relief valve modeled in this scenario is a Hansen Technologies H5604.  This valve has an inlet port size of 1-1/4\u00c2\u00bf and an outlet port size of 1-1/2\u00c2\u00bf and discharge flow rating of 116 pounds per minute (air rating) which converts to 90.70 pounds per minute ammonia at a pressure setting of 250 psig.  The typical release duration may not reach the property boundaries of most Tyson facilities, though EPA requires the alternative release scenarios to reach the boundary.  Tyson chose the release duration of 5 minutes in an urban setting to yield a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles which reaches and exceeds the property boundary at the Sanford facility.  \n\n4.  \tThe general accidental release prevention program\n\nThis facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.

All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. To insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Mexican Original, Sanford NC, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2. \tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Sanford, NC. facility manufactures corn and flour products and uses anhydrous ammonia for the refrigeration system.   The system  inventory is  19,346 lbs.\n\n3.   \tWorst-Case Scenario \u00c2\u00bf \n\nThe Mexican Original - Sanford facility has an ammonia high pressure receiver as the single largest ammonia vessel.  The liquid-full capacity of the high pressure receiver is 432.5 cubic feet.  Using the ammonia condensing temperature of 95 degrees yields an approximate operating pressure of 181 psig and an ammonia liquid density of 36.71 pounds per cubic foot.  The calculation of 432.5 cubic feet multiplied by the liquid density yields the ammonia capacity of 15,865 pounds.  Using RMP Comp with the settings of ammonia liquefied under pressure, urban topography and no passive mitigation the distance to endpoint is 1.5 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \u00c2\u00bf \n\nTyson Foods has chosen the alternative release scenario of a pressure relief valve activation.

This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment.  All Hazmat courses at Tyson Foods, Inc., are designed to meet training requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) (7) and (8). All, Mexican Original, Sanford Plant, Hazmat Team Members are trained 24 hours initially to the Technician level followed by 8-24 hours of refresher training per year under the direction of the on-site Hazmat Instructor at the facility. Each Instructor receives an initial 40 hours of training and 8-16 hours per year recertification training that goes to I.C. level.  The training is designed to teach both theory and hands-on training giving the person an overall understanding of the nature of hazardous materials and the ability to assess and safely respond to the incidents in the Incident Command structure. Technician level training includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Knowledge of basic hazards and risk assessment techniques\n\u00c2\u00bf Proper selection and use of appropriate and required PPE for the chemical hazard\n\u00c2\u00bf Terminology associated with Hazmat\n\u00c2\u00bf Advanced site control/security procedures\n\u00c2\u00bf Advanced Containment/Control/Decon procedures\n\n7. \tPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nThe Corporate Process Safety and Risk Management Program will be undergoing upgrades in the coming months in 2009 and 2010 that will result in streamlined and consistency driven approaches to management of hazardous chemicals covered by PSM and RMP at Tyson Foods.
