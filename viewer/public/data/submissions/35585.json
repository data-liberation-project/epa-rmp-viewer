Santa Fe Springs, California, Bleach facility is committed to the safety and well being of its employees, neighboring community, and the environment.  Pioneer is an active member of the Chlorine Institute, an industry group that develops technology for the safe handling and management of chlorine.  Pioneer also participates in the Canadian Chemical Producers? Association Responsible Care? initiative.  Responsible Care? is the industry?s effort to reach out and dialogue with the public regarding our environmental, health and safety programs and to receive input from the community on issues of concern.  Pioneer Santa Fe Springs is also a participating member of the Santa Fe Springs area Community Awareness and Emergency Response (?CAER?) group.\n\nStationary Source\n\nThe site produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic) and repackages chlorine into 1-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders.  The site also distributes sulfur dioxide.  These chemicals provide important benefits in critical applications such as water purification and household disinfectants.  Pioneer?s policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of a hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThis Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Pioneer Santa Fe Springs Bleach facility.\n\nLiquefied chlorine is received in 90-ton rail cars and repackaged into one-ton containers, 150-pound cylinders, and tank trucks.  It is also used in the manufacture of bleach.  Customers use both chlorine and bleach to treat drinking water, wastewater, swimming pool water and industrial water to eliminate and/or prevent the g"

Reg. 18819) and the RMP*Submit 2004 Help Page, the ARSs are not included in this Executive Summary.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPioneer has a comprehensive release prevention program, meeting the California Accidental Release Prevention (?CalARP?) program, the Federal RMP Prevention Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management (?PSM?) requirements.  We have physical safeguards in place to prevent a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  We also follow best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation.  Our process design includes expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo accidents have occurred in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPioneer has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes detection, alarm, shutdown and containment systems to halt and/or mitigate a release.  In the unlikely event that a release cannot be controlled completely with these systems, Pioneer has an Emergency Response Team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a writte"

The SFSFD Hazmat Unit has participated with Pioneer in several training exercises at the Santa Fe Springs facility.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPioneer has made significant changes to improve safety, including the expansion of both the coverage and functionality of the chlorine monitor system, the addition of video surveillance cameras, the installation of tank level controls, upgrades to the chlorine vent and disposal system, and additional interlocks and automatic shutdown devices a new controlled gate entry, 24-hour manned security.  Future plans for improved safety include the expansion of the video surveillance system, including the installation of a Web Cam, and perimeter fence upgrade to further limit access to the facility."
