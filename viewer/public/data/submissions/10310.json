The main goal of\nthe hazard assessment is to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental releases.\n\nThe Morris Coop Association currently stores propane and anhydrous ammonia in amounts\nwhich exceed threshold limits established by the EPA.  The Morris Coop Association sets high\nstandards for achieving environmental and safety compliance at its facilities, and this hazard\nassessment was completed to fulfill requirements of the Clean Air Act and to reduce the risk of\nan accidental release.  \n\nPRIMARY ACTIVITIES\nMorris Coop Association is a retail farm supply cooperative which supplies anhydrous ammonia\nand propane to farmers and residents in and around Stevens County, Minnesota.\nThe total amount of 60,000 gallons of propane and 48,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia is\nstored at the Coop Bulk facility located on the north end of Morris, Minnesota.\n\n\nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst case scenario involves a catastrophic release of 30,000 gallons (150,700 lbs) of\npropane.  A large propane vapor cloud forms, which contacts an ignition source and detonates,\nproducing a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nThe distance to the endpoint for this type of explosion is 0.43 miles.  The endpoint utilized for\nvapor cloud explosions is 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure.  This amount of\noverpressure can cause partial demolition of houses and can result in serious injury to people. \nThe estimated maximum population within this endpoint distance is 75 people.\n\n\nFLAMMABLES: ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThis scenario represents a release associated with an accidental breakage in a product pipe.

A cloud of flammable gas forms,\ncontacts an ignition source, and detonates, producing a vapor cloud explosion. \n\n\nThe distance to the endpoint for this explosion is 0.12 miles.  The maximum estimated\npopulation within this endpoint distance was 10 people (Figure 3).\n\n\nTOXICS: WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO \nThe toxic worst case scenario involves a catastrophic release of 154,380 lbs. of anhydrous\nammonia.
