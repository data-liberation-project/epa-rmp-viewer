Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nAutomated Solutions, LLC - Plant #3 is a manufacturing facility located in Statesville, North Carolina.  As a result of the polyethylene foam manufacturing process, isobutane is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity specified by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  The facility has one covered process that is subject to Program Level 3 requirements under the EPA RMP regulation as it is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).   Automated Solutions, LLC maintains an aboveground storage tank of isobutane, which is used in the production of polyethylene foam products.\n\nIsobutane is delivered to the facility via tank truck (11,000-gallon portable tank used at this time which is provided at 85% fill level or 9,350 gallons or 44,000 lbs).  Once a permanent storage system is in place. a vapor recovery system will prevent the release of isobutane vapors to the atmosphere during the transfer.   Isobutane is pumped from the storage tank to the pump room where the pressure is increased so it can be injected into extruders.\n\nThe facility holds a Title V permit.\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Automated Solutions, LLC -\nPlant #3\nAutomated Solutions, LLC is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the\nenvironment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to\nreleases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Plant Safety Manual and Incident Plan.\nSafety, environmental protection, and RMP plans programs are implemented and coordinated with Iredell Emergency Management for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Five-year Accident History\nAutomated Solutions, LLC - Plant #3 has not had an accidental release of isobutane in the past five years.\n\nD.
