Our KEEP management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for through KEEP.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Mont Belvieu Fractionator Facility is one of several facilities operated by KOCH Hydrocarbon Company (Koch) receiving demethanized mix from three pipelines and fractionating this mix into five separate products. These products are ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The products are then delivered via pipeline to third party customers.  Ethane, propane, isobutane and normal butane are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Mont Belvieu Facility. At the facility, we have no toxic chemicals above threshold quantity.   The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operation at the facility, our programs to prevent accidents, our emergency response plans in case an accide"

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the butane in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Mont Belvieu Fractionator Facility, this would involve our 105,000-gallon butane bullet.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance that the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.6 miles (approximately 3,200 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  The alternative release scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario, is calculated to reach approximately 0.3 miles (approximately 1,600 feet) from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPA OCA methods, which are known to overpredict the impact of any potential release from such a scenario.  No credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  We selected the alternative release scenario based on a release of butane due to an overfill of a butane bullet.  We have several active mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  These active mitigation measures include the following:  1) the level in the vessel is continuously monitored in the control room and inventory is maintained below 50% of capacity;  2) If our customers can not receive product at any time, the product is recirculated back to the process so that the level in the vessel remains manageable;  3) level and pressure alarms are located on all bullets, and:  4) a plant-wide emergency shutdown is available if necessary.  The presence of these active mitigation measur"

Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n7 We installed continuous pilot ignition and a failure alarm on the flare to ensure uninterrupted combustion of hydrocarbons.\n7 We installed heat-activated deluge system in the compressor rooms.\n7 We have hydrocarbon detectors in our compressor room to ensure that a release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n7 We provided employees and contractors with an orientation on personal protective equipment to insure personal safety.\n7 A fire water system is in place to ensure quick response to fires.\n7 We provided high level alarms on our bullets in order to prevent overfilling.  \n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility since we acquired it in 1997.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo incident having resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a release of an RMP substance has occurred at the Mont Belvieu Facility since we acquired it in 1997.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues."

The Mont Belvieu Facility Manager at KOCH is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drills, and training.  Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Mont Belvieu Facility.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n7 The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n7 The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n7 The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n7 Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n7 An ongoing dialogue with the Chambers County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the"
