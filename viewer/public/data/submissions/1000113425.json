      "SummaryText": "Kerry - Fort Worth\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nI. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIt is the policy of Kerry, Inc to implement a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68. Included in this process is the implementation of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe purpose of implementing these programs is to prevent the release of anhydrous ammonia. By doing so we protect employees and guests on site while protecting the general public off site. \n\nAs part of these programs, Kerry has developed an emergency action plan that regularly coordinates with local fire department and other off site emergency personnel.\n\nII. The stationary source and regulated substance handled: Ammonia Quantity 79,600 lbs\n\nThe food production process at this facility requires very low temperatures to process and maintain the finished product. The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia to provide the proper temperature in the production areas, coolers and blast freezers. \n\nIII. General accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention.\n\nA. Kerry - Fort Worth has designed and implemented a preventative maintenance program to reduce the potential for release of ammonia from the refrigerations system. This program complies with the requirements of OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management. The key concept of this release prevention program is employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment and appropriate training of all Kerry Team Members.\n\nThe PSM Team is responsible for conducting and implementing findings from the PHA Process Hazard Analysis for the ammonia system. Team members are also members of the facility emergency response team. This ER Team has developed an Emergency Response Plan which includes specific procedures and equipment to allow the safe response to an ammonia leak or release. These procedures are designed to minimize a leak or release.\n\nIV. Five-year accident"

      "SummaryText": "history\n\nThere have not been any releases of anhydrous ammonia at this facility in the last five years that resuted in deaths, injuries, or significant damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nV. Emergency Response Program\n\nKerry has developed an Emergency Action Plan. Kerry does not intend or allow their employees to response to releases. The refrigeration department is equipped with Air Purifying Respirators for Handling Small Releases and maintenance, but does not respond to emergencies in the process.\n\nVI. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe Facility PSM Team is continuously evaluating operational, maintenance, and safety procedures to reduce the possibility of a release of ammonia and ensure the safety of Team members, guests, and the general public off site. \n\nOur plan is to continue to add highly skilled refrigeration mechanics to our staff. We are also providing skills training to the team members we now have on staff."
