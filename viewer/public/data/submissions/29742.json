GE Contractual Services has been contracted by the owner to operate the facility.  This facility has been in operation since 1988.  The facility is located wholly within the boundaries of the IMTT bulk storage terminal.  The land use immediately surrounding the facility is industrial.  Residential and commercial land use occurs approximately 1,600 feet from the site.\n\nThe facility combusts natural gas in three GE Frame 6 combustion turbines to generate electricity.  Each combustion turbine is equipped with a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) that utilizes waste heat from the exhaust to convert water to steam.  The steam from each HRSG is combined to drive a steam turbine.  Electricity is generated at each gas turbine and the steam turbine.  Steam is also piped to offsite industrial facilities.  A State mandated selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system is located within each HRSG to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the combustion turbine exhaust gas.  Each SCR consists of a catalyst and injection grid within the HRSG.  Ammonia gas is injected through the grid upstream of the catalyst.  The ammonia mixes with the exhaust gas and as the exhaust/ammonia mixture passes through the catalyst, NOx emissions are reduced to nitrogen and water.\n\nThe ammonia injected into the HRSG is stored in a 30,000 gallon storage tank which is kept pressurized by ambient radiant heat and/or electric vaporizers.  No more than 64,000 pounds (lbs) of ammonia is stored on site at any time.  The ammonia gas generated in the storage tank flows to an ammonia skid located adjacent to each HRSG.  The ammonia gas is mixed with air through a blower system and then the ammonia/air mixture flows to the injection grid.  The injection grid is a simple pipe system with outlets provided within t"

These regulations have required the development of risk management programs and procedures similar to the EPA's risk management requirements.  The elements of these programs include safety information, standard operating procedures, training, maintenance, emergency response, incident investigation, hot works, safety reviews, compliance reporting, employee participation, management of change, contractor safety, hazard reviews, and hazard assessments.\n\nThe facility has also implemented environmental programs and procedures to ensure compliance with all environmental regulations.  These programs and procedures, maintained in manuals at the plant, are kept up to date and available to all plant personnel.  The program consists of the environmental permits and plans required to operate the facility.  In addition to these programs, GE also maintains an EHS program.  Elements of the GE program include hazard work permits, employee training, and general safety procedures.  GE is also ISO 9000 certified.\n\nIn summary, the owner and GE have developed, implemented, and maintained environmental programs to ensure that risks associated with all plant operations are minimized and employees, nearby populations, and the environment are protected.\n\nRisk Management Program Summary  \n\nThe owner has maintained a risk management program at the facility.  The Manager Asset and Contract Management has overall responsibility for maintaining this program.

Change procedures do not apply to replacement in kind.\n\nEmployee participation has always been implemented at the facility.  Employees are included in hazard reviews and incident investigations.  In addition, employees conduct self-assessments (plant audits conducted by employees), hold weekly safety meetings, conduct annual drills, and participate in safety committees.  \n\nHazard reviews have been conducted at this facility.  The last hazard review was conducted in May 2003.  Hazard reviews identify the hazards associated with the process, opportunities for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunctions or human error, and steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases.  Once the hazard review is completed, a list of recommendations is developed and reviewed by plant personnel and management.  The recommendations are then implemented at the site to further reduce the risk associated with the ammonia system.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nA hazard assessment has been completed to comply with the RMP regulations.  The hazard assessment consists of analyzing the effects of a worst case release scenario and an alternate scenario.  The worst case release considers the entire contents of the ammonia tank being released within 10 minutes.  A dispersion model was utilized to model the offsite impacts of such a release.  The model is known as SLAB.  The results of the model estimate that the worst case release scenario may hypothetically have a maximum endpoint distance of 2.13 miles and have a potential impact on residences, hospitals, parks and industrial/commercial facilities.  No environmental receptors are believed to be impacted.  The only mitigation allowed by the regulation and applicable to"

Cogen submits that this is not a credible scenario as previous hazard assessments have determined that the frequency of a catastrophic vessel failure is 1.5E-05 per year.  In addition, the ammonia tank is surrounded by a water curtain that can be utilized to deluge ammonia vapors originating from the tank.  Furthermore the ammonia storage tank does not operate under the temperatures or pressures required to facilitate this release scenario.\n\nThe ammonia storage tank undergoes in service and out of service inspections in accordance with API standards, monthly safety inspections, and daily inspections.  In addition, the ammonia tank is protected by concrete barriers to prevent exposure to traffic in the plant.  All truck deliveries are escorted by plant personnel and the plant is enclosed in a security fence with monitored access.  The plant also coordinates emergency drills with the local fire department and provides information and equipment to the fire department to support site emergency activities.\n \nAn alternate release scenario was also analyzed.  The alternate release scenario was developed assuming a 1.17 inch diameter hole in an ammonia line releases ammonia for one hour.  This scenario may also represent a leak from a delivery hose or a crack in a valve.  The EPA RMP*Comp model was used to determine offsite impacts.  The results of the modeling estimate that the endpoint distance will be 0.20 miles and have no impact on residences, hospitals, or parks.  Only the adjacent industry could be impacted by this release scenario.  This scenario takes into account that it will take 60 minutes to respond and stop the release.  The mitigation effects of the water curtain were not considered in this analysis.

The emergency response program includes an emergency response plan and coordination of emergency information and activities with the Bayonne Fire Department.  The emergency response plan contains the information and procedures necessary to respond to a release of any hazardous material at the site.  Emergency information includes a list of emergency response personnel, notification requirements, evacuation procedures, and health/first aid data.  The facility has confirmed with the Bayonne Fire Department that personnel and equipment necessary to respond to a release of a hazardous substance at the site will be provided.  Coordination with the fire department has included providing a copy of the emergency response plan, drawings, and other plant operating data.  The emergency information has been placed in a computer program that is used as a reference at an emergency site by the department's hazmat unit.  The fire department has participated in plant emergency response drills and drill critiques for the last five years.  The facility also contributes emergency equipment to the fire department.  In addition to emergency drills, the fire department tours the facility to familiarize their personnel with plant operations and the locations of potential hazards."
