We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designated and implemented, including:\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA?s RMP regulation\n?    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n?    A five year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA?s RMP rule\n?    An overview of our emergency response program\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental release from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n?    The certifications that EPA?s RMP rule requires us to provide\n?    The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces various cakes and pies using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. In our processes, we use the following toxic chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in our facility to cool our warehouse, shipping areas and freezers.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-Case release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nThe ammonia falls under Program 3 requirements. Failure of our largest ammonia vessel would be the worst case scenario for our facility. The recirculator vessel is inside our building. In the worst case scenario, approximately 5,000 pounds could be released in 10 minutes. Using EPA RMP*Comp Software, such a release could reach receptors 0.3 miles (1584 feet) from the plant before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard (0.14 mg/l or 200 ppm ammonia) to the public.. Based on 2000 U.S. Census and Landview mapping software, approximately 113 people live within 0.3 miles of our facility. Within that distance are residences, business, schools, churches and correctional facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (s) ? Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nThe alternative release scenario for our facility is based on a more likely event rather than the worst case scenario. We have assumed an outdoor relief valve (for example, near an evaporative condenser) opens (lifts) and the release goes undetected for 60 minutes before employees manually isolate the problem. The potential release of 6540 pounds of ammonia gas results in a distance to toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/l or 2000 ppm) at 0.10 miles (528 feet). This distance is determined using EPA RMP*Comp Software.

Our company and or employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. There have been no accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA?s RMP rule during the past five years. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
