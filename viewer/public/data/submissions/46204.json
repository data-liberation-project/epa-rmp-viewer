Executive Summary\n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Palatka Operations (GP Palatka) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for GP Palatka workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Palatka. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide) - see topic 1.2\n\n\n\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n\n\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program a"

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substances and injuries and damage resulting from the release of hazardous substances.\n\n\n\nGP Palatka minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When the hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nGP Palatka limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility works with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event a release does occur.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at GP Palatka consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule. This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nGP Palatka is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the f"

GP Palatka provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President Pulp and Paper of Palatka Operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2    Georgia-Pacific Palatka Operations and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Palatka Operations is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of brown and bleached pulp and paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) for the use of bleaching pulp. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of the chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP-covered processes in Program Level 3. The threshold quantity for Chlorine Dioxide is approximately 53,460 pounds (428,000 gallons at a 15 gram per liter (1.5% in solution) strength) during peak operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3    Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nGP Palatka performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substances to affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release case scenarios. The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like GP Palatka and (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred.  The alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee "

The following effects could occur at the endpoint distances. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Palatka Operations. These requirements include:\n\n\n\n* one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\n* one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Georgia-Pacific Palatka Operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process - Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) Solution System\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the chlorine dioxide system is the rupture of a single 214,000-gallon storage tank.  The RMP Rule mandates that, for the worst-case scenario, the analysis assume loss of the largest storage vessel in ten minutes. The released chlorine dioxide would evaporate to form a vapor cloud.

There are also several environmental receptors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a chlorine dioxide solution line located at the discharge side of the ClO2 transfer pumps' header. During normal operations, the pump could pump approximately 880 gallons per minute for five minutes before the release might be recognized and isolated. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration, based on the EPA Lookup Table approach, is 3.0 miles. The United States Census indicates that approximately 9,329 people live within this distance from the discharge line at the chlorine dioxide solution transfer pumps.

Employee Participation. The facility has developed a written employee participation program for the covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of GP Palatka employees are addressed. The facility encourages active participation from personnel in the development and maintenance of the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP Rule prevention program, including the development of Process Hazard Analysis and Operating Procedures.\n\n\n\n2. Process Safety Information. The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the processes. The documents address (1) the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, (2) the technology data of the process, and (3) the design basis and configurations of the equipment used in the processes. The facility ensures that this process safety information is maintained, accurate, and available to all GP Palatka employees, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). All of the information and documentation for the RMP Prevention Program is maintained in the PSM/RMP Center at the facility.\n\n\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the facility, including non-regulated substances in the covered process.

GP Palatka performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience, and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses, is assembled to analyze the process. The facility primarily uses the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) and/or \"What If'\" techniques, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n\n\n4. Operating Procedures. GP Palatka operators, supervisors, and engineers work together to develop and maintain accurate operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and upset operating conditions. The operating procedures include:\n\n\n\n-    steps for safely conducting activities\n\n\n\n-    applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\n\n\n\n-    safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substa"

The facility reviews and certifies the operating procedures annually.\n\n\n\n5. Training. GP Palatka trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. The facility training program for process operators includes both the initial training and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Written tests and oral reviews are used to verify that the employee understands the training materials before the employee can operate the process.\n\n\n\nThe operators are consulted annually about the frequency of the training and the materials to be used for the training. Recommendations from the operators are reviewed and changes to the training are implemented as appropriate.\n\n\n\n6. Contractors.  GP Palatka has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the facility are performed in a safe manner. The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the facility only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks. GP Palatka explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the facility safe work practices, and the emergency response procedures for the facility. The facility requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work on or near a covered process before that employee begins work at the site. The facility periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n\n\n7. Pre-startup Safety R"

GP Palatka performs a safety review of new or modified equipment in the covered process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely. This review confirms that:\n\n\n\n-    construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\n\n\n-    adequate safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place\n\n\n\n-    employee training has been completed\n\n\n\n-    for a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified.\n\n\n\nA pre-startup safety review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that the appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n\n\n8. Mechanical Integrity.  GP Palatka maintains the mechanical integrity of the covered process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. The facility mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meets the design standards required for service in GP Palatka covered processes. The facility mechanical integrity program also includes:\n\n\n\n-    specifications for inspection and testing of process equipment\n\n\n\n-    specifications for replacement parts and equipment\n\n\n\n-    standard maintenance procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment\n\n\n\n-    procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tag out, hot work, and confined space entry\n\n\n\n-    training of maintenance personnel\n\n\n\n-    documentation of maintenance activity\n\n\n\n9.
