This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System.  The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 21,800-gallon (gal) storage tank (bullet tank) at the site.   The Wilbur-Ellis, Dixon facility also stored up to 30 1,000-gallon nurse tanks that could contain anhydrous ammonia at any given time.  The facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity to 82 percent (%) of the fill capacity for both covered processes.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 162,020 pounds (lb.) \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case/Alternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\n\nPer CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario have been defined for each process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAnhydrous ammonia storage and distribution has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the community. The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the pote"

Specifically, the external events requirements were met with the following actions:\n\n   1)    The types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA ?2760.2.  During the PHA, a broad list of external events was considered by the Study Team.  The external events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, vandalism, sabotage, external fire, human error/misoperation, and vehicle impact.\n\n   2)    The estimated magnitude or scope of external events which were considered.  If not known, the owner or operator of the stationary source shall work closely with the Administering Agency (AA) to determine what is required.  If seismic events are applicable, the parameters used in the consideration of the seismic analysis and which edition of the Uniform Building Code was used "

The Wilbur-Ellis Dixon Facility will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders.  The facility has filed a Business Emergency Plan to help coordinate with local responders.  An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the requirements of the CCR Title 8 ?3220 is in place.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWilbur-Ellis is committed to continuously making safety improvements. To improve the safety of the anhydrous ammonia system, Wilbur-Ellis is in the process of developing a more comprehensive anhydrous ammonia inspection checklist for the bullet tank system and nurse tanks. The comprehensive checklist will include daily, weekly, and annual inspection frequencies, including visual and non-destructive tests to evaluate the mechanical integrity of the tanks, valves, piping, etc. At a minimum, inspection frequencies will follow industry standards.\n\nWilbur-Ellis is also implementing a facility-wide comprehensive corrective action/preventative action (CAPA) log to track and facilitate completion of listed CAs on a timely basis. Recommended improvements and identified deficiencies from the inspection checklists, compliance audits, and PHA studies will be included on the facility CAPA log along with the priorit"
