      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary  (40 CFR 68.155)\n\n\nBackground Data\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Specialty Polymers, Inc. (SPI) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their facility in Chester, South Carolina.  SPI is a chemical manufacturing facility.  Operations include the manufacture of polymer resins and emulsions.  SPI has been producing quality products at their main facility in Oregon for over 27 years and provides over 50 jobs to the local community.  The plant in South Carolina was constructed with \"safety\" as a primary goal, using state-of-the-art equipment.  Approximately 10 employees are employed to operate the Chester facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSPI is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is SPI policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120), OSHA's Emergency Plans and Fire Protection Plans (29 CFR 1910.38), and OSHA's Hazard Communication regulations (29 CFR 1910.1200).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nAt SPI, vinyl acetate monomer (CAS 108-05-4) is reacted to produce a product for industrial distribution.  SPI's system consisting of two (2) bulk storage tanks, a reactor vessel, and associated piping can contain a quantity of vinyl acetate in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold given in Appendix A of 40 CFR 68.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, SPI has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for vinyl acetate using the parameters specified by the EPA.  SPI's worst-case release scenario is the rupture of the largest single tank (bulk storage tank) into a diked containment area resulting in a toxic liquid pool.  In developing the release pa"

      "SummaryText": "rameters of this worst-case scenario, SPI considered passive mitigation provided by the newly built dike enclosure, designed specifically for toxic containment and spill prevention.  Volatilization rate of the toxic liquid was determined using the EPA guidance document.  Using the EPA's RMP*Comp program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this worst-case scenario has the potential to result in an offsite release.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nSPI evaluated several options to be considered as alternative release scenarios.  After careful consideration, SPI decided that the scenario more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, which could result in an offsite consequence, is the sheering of a vinyl acetate process pipe.  It is assumed that a vinyl acetate release from a sheered transfer line would result in a small liquid pool and volatilize.\n\nIn developing the release parameters of the Alternative Release Scenario, SPI considered average response time to shut the system down and pressure loss sensors disabling the transfer pump as an active mitigation.  Using EPA's RMP*Comp program and EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the toxic endpoint in the alternative release scenario has the potential to result in offsite consequences.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of vinyl acetate monomer, SPI has implemented several precautionary measures.  SPI has developed and will implement an Emergency Action Plan and a Hazardous Materials Contingency Plan.  SPI has also complied with EPA's 112r General Duty clause.  As such, the vinyl acetate system has been evaluated for release potential.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of vinyl acetate are process controls (vents, relief valves, check valves, rupture "

SPI encourages employee participation in the development of the control measures used at the plant.  Employees have the opportunity to voice opinions, concerns, questions, or ideas during the monthly training sessions or during the quarterly safety meetings.  For topics that require more immediate attention, SPI employees may approach their supervisor directly or place suggestions in the suggestion box.\n\nSPI understands that maintaining the system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases.  As such, SPI will conduct preventive maintenance on the process equipment on a monthly basis.  The preventive maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.\n\nTo confirm that control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits will be performed on the vinyl acetate system.  SPI conducts compliance audits every three years.  The next compliance audit will be conducted in 2007.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Chester facility began operations during January 2000 and has not experienced an accidental  release of vinyl acetate monomer.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSPI has documented emergency response procedures in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an offsite release of vinyl acetate.  Included in the emergency response program are measures to be taken internally by SPI employees and procedures to inform local emergency response agencies.\n\nTo assure that the local municipal response agencies are familiar with SPI's emergency response procedures, copies of the emergency response document will b"
