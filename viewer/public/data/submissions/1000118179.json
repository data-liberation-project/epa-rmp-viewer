The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nMongoose Gas Plant is located near Westbrook, Texas. It is a plant that is designed to extract carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from raw natural gas and produce treated gas for further processing by other parties. Mongoose Gas Plant exceeds the threshold quantity for hydrogen sulfide during normal processing activities including downhole transfer of acid gas, an injectate containing the waste stream indicated above.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nMongoose Gas Plant implements a site-specific PSM program that consists of all of the required 14 elements of PSM. Since this facility is a Program Level 3 facility, requirements for a prevention program are fulfilled by ongoing compliance with provisions of the PSM regulation.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nMongoose Gas Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nMongoose Gas Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agenci"

Further, the plant is subject to TRRC Rule 36 that requires the implementation of a Hydrogen Sulfide Contingency Plan. Provisions of this plan include notification of potential public receptors upon an offsite release, among others. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is a high priority.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nTejon Treating believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Tejon continues to\nlook for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Tejon also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and\nprocedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is a high priority."
