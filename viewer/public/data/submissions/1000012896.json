Raw water is chlorinated for disinfection purposes prior to entry in the distribution system.\n\nThe LNVA WTP is operated by trained staff 24 hours per day, 7days per week. Standard procedures have been developed for operation and maintenance of the facility, including the chlorination system. Safety information and materials are maintained on-site to protect facility personnel, the public and the environment.\n\nFacility personnel have conducted chemical release scenarios to determine and evaluate potential off-site impacts. Measures are in place to minimize the potential of such an occurrence. No off-site chemical release has occurred in the history of the facility.\n\nLNVA collaborates with the Chambers County LEPC for emergency response. In the event of an emergency, the Chambers County LEPC and the Winnie Stowell Fire Department would be contacted to lead the response\nefforts."
