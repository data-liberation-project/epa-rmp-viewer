In a worst case scenario (such as the bursting of a 2000 pound cylinder and releasing its contents), emergency services (such as the fire department), would be notified. Unnecessary personnel would leave the area to a distance of 1.30 miles. Other facilities would be informed within this distance, and appropriate personal protective equipment would be put on by trained personnel and the spill would be contained by use of a special rescue cylinder repair kit.\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous) cylinders are ruggedly designed and DOT approved. A protective cap covers the cylinder valves at all times when the cylinder is not in use. The cylinders are equipped with pressure relief devices to prevent rupture of the cylinder if exposed to heat.\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous) cylinders are unloaded, handled, and loaded by special equipment designed specifically for cylinder handling.
