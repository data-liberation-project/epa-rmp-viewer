      "SummaryText": "The Potter County Pump Station is a groundwater pumping station having a present pumping capacity of approximately 22 million gallons per day (mgd).  The water is disinfected with chlorine gas as it is discharged into the transmission pipeline that carries it to selected out-of-city industries and into the City of Amarillo water treatment plant.  A maximum of six employees work at the pumping station during normal business hours, not including contractors, vendors, or visitors.  After business hours the facility is secured.  The pump station is located approximately 18.5 miles northeast of downtown Amarillo in the northeastern quadrant of Potter County, Texas.  \n\n\n\n    Ongoing safety training programs cover all phases of plant operation from maintenance and operations safety to safe handling of chlorine.  The Potter County facility will conduct formal training as well as onsite training during normal daily operations.  This facility has not been in existence for five years.  No accidents have been recorded to date.  \n\n\n\n    Chlorine gas is the primary disinfectant chemical used in this facility.  The chlorine gas is stored in one ton containers.  A maximum of eight one ton containers of chlorine gas are stored onsite, with a maximum of two one ton containers being connected to the header at any one time and one in use. \n\n\n\n    "
