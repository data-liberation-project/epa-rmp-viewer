              "Description": "The prevention program for Fort Detrick?s WTP mirrors the OSHA PSM requirements and consists of a combination of engineering controls and administrative procedures.  For example, the vacuum regulators are mounted directly on the chlorine tanks to minimize the possibility of a leak in the lines, and all operators have been certified by the Maryland State Board of Waterworks and Waste Systems Operations.  The chlorine sensors, with audio and visual alarms to warn plant operators, are set to automatically alert first responders, the Fort Detrick Fire Department, if an alarm is triggered, via the Motorola Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (MOSCAD) system.  Operators are trained to not investigate or respond to a potential release, only the Fire Department.  Contractors are responsible for regular inspections and maintenance of the chlorine system and the alarms.  These inspections are done at a minimum of once every month.  There are no major changes to the RMP Prevention Program regarding the chlorination system have taken place since the last RMP update. The initial RMP report can be consulted for more information about the hazards of chlorine gas, the technology of chlorination, the process equipment, specific operating procedures, employee training and employee participation plans, as well as procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, managing change, conducting pre-startup review and compliance audits, investigating incidents and issuing hot work permits.  The Prevention Program was last reviewed during a compliance audit in September of 2020.  The most recent PHA was conducted on 29 September 2020.",

Its primary mission includes biomedical research and development, medical materiel management and global telecommunications. Fort Detrick is situated on approximately 1,200 acres and is 46 miles northwest of Baltimore City and 45 miles north of Washington, DC. Approximately 7,800 military, federal and contract personnel are employed by Fort Detrick. Fort Detrick WTP facility is located off base at 1930 North Market Street, Frederick Maryland 21701. Surface water from a tributary of the Monocacy River is treated at the facility using various chemical treatments prior to being distributed to Fort Detrick water users.  Based on an assessment of the chlorine system used at the facility (chlorine storage greater than 2,500 pounds), the WTP is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA) Process Safety Management Rule (PSM), and 40 CFR 68 it is considered a Program Level 3 processes. Chlorine is the only chemical stored at a facility operated by Fort Detrick that exceeds threshold quantities of 40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine treatment system consists of two (2) 2000-pound cylinders (one on-line, one on standby). Fort Detrick operates the chlorine treatment system in accordance with standard industry practices and monitors the performance of the system on a regular basis.  The safety of all WTP operations are continually reviewed and improved.  It is the policy of Fort Detrick to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws\n\nThe Risk Management Program at Fort Detrick is designed to prevent a catastrophic release of chlorine gas via the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to manage chemical process risk. Key participants in this program include t"

For example, vacuum regulators are mounted directly on the chlorine tanks to minimize the possibility of a leak in the lines, and all operators have been certified by the Maryland State Board of Waterworks and Waste Systems Operations. Additionally, the chlorine sensors have audible alarms and lights that automatically alert the Fire and Emergency Services Division. The PHA update for Fort Detrick's WTP chlorination system was performed in September 2020 and revealed no significant additional safety issues that need to be addressed and only minor corrections to information provided in the previous PHA. Fort Detrick maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program. These are applied to the treatment plant. The program address each of the EPA's, RMP Level 3 Program-listed 12 elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in OSHA's PSM program. The WTP is in compliance with both. These documents are maintained and implemented by Fort Detrick's Water Treatment Supervisor. \n\nSince the last RMP update there have been no reportable changes to the WTP process. A compliance audit for the RMP was last conducted in October 2020. \n\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted. The first is a \"worst case release\". The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas ov"

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\nFort Detrick continually reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for its WTP operations. Currently, the Fort Detrick management team are reviewing potential upgrades to the existing design of the chlorine operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of chlorine that correspond to compliance audit recommendations of October 2020.\n\n\n\nFort Detrick has not had any accidents involving chlorine gas with any off-site or on-site impacts in the past five years. Information about the off-site consequence analysis is included in the RMP Submit.\n\nAs part of the Emergency Response Program, Fort Detrick WTP operators do not act as first responders in the event of a chlorine release. Fort Detrick Fire and Emergency Services personnel act as first responders. They are fully trained and equipped to handle a release or other chlorine emergency to the magnitude in which chlorine is stored. They review their emergency response procedures periodically and continuously train their personnel as first responders and hazardous material (HAZMAT) technicians. The Fort Detrick Fire and Emergency Services Division is a member of the local community response network with a mutual aid agreement in place to assist or be assisted by the Frederick County Fire and Rescue Services. Procedures to notify the public and local agencies have also been developed and are documented in the Fort Detrick Integrated Contingency Plan. Fort Detrick has a Facility Emergency Response Plan in place, which was last updated in October 2020.\n\n"
