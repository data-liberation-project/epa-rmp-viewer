These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nAEROPRES promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nAEROPRES believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, AEROPRES employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nAEROPRES has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process. \n\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87] \nAEROPRES hires 3 contractor operators at the Victoria site.. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. AEROPRES has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance"

Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis and the facility has a plan in place for evacuations, adequate first aid, and medical treatment and notification of local emergency response agencies. The facility is a non-responding facility, and relies on the Victoria, TX Fire Departments to respond to chemical releases.\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nAEROPRES is committed to improving our safety systems. In an effort to continually improve our systems, AEROPRES has an internal process for reviewing all of our safety systems. Additionally, all process changes regarding Propane are reviewed by the site management team prior to making any change. This provides expert review from each critical discipline, i.e. personnel safety, environmental, process safety, etc.\n\nAEROPRES has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.  We believe that the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation, and our commitment to continuous improvement that an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."
