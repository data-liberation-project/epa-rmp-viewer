In this way, we promote overall plant and worker safety.\r\n\r\nOur RMP (Risk Management Plan) enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, the RMP prevents accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoids physical property damage.\r\nOur RMP prevents accidents by focusing on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\nOur RMP contains the following major elements:\r\n\tManagement System \r\nPurpose / Scope\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nGeneral Company Policy\r\nGoals and Objectives\r\nProcedure\r\n\tHazard Assessment\r\n\t\tPurpose / Scope\r\n\t\tProcedure\r\n\t\tWorst Case Scenario\r\n\t\tAlternate Release Scenario\r\n\t\tOffsite Impacts\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\tAccident Prevention Program\r\n\t\tPurpose / Scope\r\n\t\tProcedure\r\n\t\tMinimum Training for Supervisors\r\n\t\tCertification\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\t\tHot Work Permit\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nCorrective Action Request\r\n\tEmergency Planning and Response Program\r\n\t\tPurpose / Scope\r\nProcedure\r\nList of approved Contractors and Qualifications\r\n\t\tPre Startup Safety Review\r\n\t\tEmployee Training - HAZWOPER 24 Hour Certification\r\n\tRisk Management Plan\r\n\t\tPurpose / Scope\r\nProcess Knowledge\r\nMechanical Integrity Program\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n       - Contractor self audit\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EHS Specialist is the program coordinator with overall responsibility to ensure tha"

      "SummaryText": "t program goals and objectives are met and appropriate resources are available. The EHS Specialist will review and update the program as necessary. Copies of the written program may be reviewed through employee communications processes, safety training/audits, and system audits.\r\nIf you feel that any improvements can be made to the RMP, please contact the EHS Specialist. We encourage all suggestions because we are committed to the success of our Risk Management Program. We strive for a comprehensive, integrated prevention system which obtains clear understanding, safe behavior, and involvement in the program from every level of the facility and the public.\r\nThe RMP identifies possible worst-case scenarios which could pose health risks to employees and outside receptors if a TDI  release were to occur. At Hyundai-Dymos, the failure of one of the main storage tanks in the tank farm would be considered a worst-case scenario. These vessels have a volume of 19  m3 with a maximum of 55 % TDI  at any one time. Based upon a maximum fill capacity of the tank at 90%, the total amount of TDI  that could be released in a worst-case scenario would be 49,545 lbs of TDI. With a release of this magnitude, the Toxic Endpoint is approximately 1.6 miles, which means the vapor would travel approximately 1.6 miles before reaching the 0.007 mg/L level, which is considered a safe level. The probability of a failure in this vessel system is very low due to the PM program by Hyundai-Dymos staff and licensed contractors, the automated level control system, and the daily operational inspections. Furthermore, significant alarms would notify personnel of such a failure and corrective action would be possible to minimize the release."
