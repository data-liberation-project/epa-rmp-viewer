THE FACILITY POLICY\n\nTHE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF FARMERS CO-OPERATIVE GRAIN ASSOCIATION ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IT AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION.\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR CROP PRODUCTION.\n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 140,000  POUNDS IN OUR STORAGE TANK. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF SEMI TRAILER HOLDING 10,000 GALLONS.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA. THE WORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK (OR SEMI-TRAILER) RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 140,000, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 2.50 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (OR THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT) IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .47 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC., AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\n5. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nTHERE HAVE"
