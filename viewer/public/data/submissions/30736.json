An integral component of the manufacture of these products is anhydrous ammonia.  Inventory exceeds the 10,000-pound threshold for anhydrous ammonia set by EPA under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule codified at 40 CFR 68.  Pursuant to the requirements of the rule, TradeMark has prepared this Risk Management Program (RMP) Plan. We are proud of our environmental, health, and safety efforts and programs and our record in these areas.  The following sections outline our RMP plan.   \n \n\nOVERALL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nOur Technical Manager and Safety and Worker Protection Manager serve as the facility's RMP and PSM Coordinators, respectively.  Together, these individuals share the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our President has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to the Technical Manager, a staff member with the necessary background, training, and experience.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the President, has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the EPA RMP elements.  In addition, the RMP Coordinator works closely with the Safety and Worker Protection Manager to integrate the elements of OSHA's PSM program (where applicable) as required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.  \n\nThe RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facility's RMP Steering Committee.  This committee comprises members with responsibilities for developing and managing specific elements of our risk management and process safety programs.
