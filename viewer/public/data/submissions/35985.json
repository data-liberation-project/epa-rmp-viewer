This RMP/CalARP, submitted by Applied Energy LLC (AE LLC), presents the 5-year anniversary update and resubmittal; there have been no process changes (per 40 CFR Part 68.190) since June 21, 1999.\n\nAs background for this facility, AE LLC is the current owner. Applied Energy, Inc.

HMD approved the RMPP for this facility on January 14, 1997.

AE LLC has in place a number of plans for responding to emergency situations.  These plans are described in this RMP Public Document.\n\n1.2    Description of Regulated Process\n\nThe cogeneration facility is located within U.S. Navy property.  The cogeneration facility provides steam to the Navy and electricity to the electric utility company, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).  The major system components are a gas turbine generator, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), a steam turbine generator, and associated equipment and control systems.  The facility began commercial operations in 1989.\n\nAE LLC uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3) to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from the gas turbine exhaust at the cogeneration facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a horizontally mounted tank.  The maximum capacity of the tank is 4,500 gallons. The tank contents are limited to a maximum of 4,000 gallons (24,320 lbs.).  Annual consumption of ammonia is approximately 48.313 gallons. \n\n1.3    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs a facility constructed and operated to provide steam to the Navy and electricity to SDG&E, AE LLC?s cogeneration facility is vital to national security and must be operated safely and efficiently. \n\nThe facility maintains, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), its Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, which provides for the identification, prevention and minimization of chemical releases that could result from failures in processes, procedures and equipment.
