USA Yeast uses aqueous ammonia as a nutrient in the production of yeast. The ammonia storage process falls under RMP's Program Level 2.  USA Yeast has developed and will maintain and update an RMP manual with its required program elements, plans, reports, and other information.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nUSA Yeast is committed to managing and operating the facility in accordance with pertinent regulations and good operating practices to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance from the yeast production process.  If an accidental release were to occur, USA Yeast has response measures in place to minimize the impact of the release.\n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIn October 2017, TRC Environmental Corporation facilitated a hazard review study to identify and risk rank hazards in the covered process and provide recommendations for safety improvements. USA Yeast compiles relevant process safety information, keeps its operating procedures up to date, and has a training program to ensure that employees are knowledgeable in facility operations and to reduce the risk of accidents during normal operations and emergencies. Written procedures have been developed to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  This includes preventive maintenance and inspection procedures, the frequency of such procedures, and referenced codes and standards for these procedures. Compliance audits will provide management with information on the success of the program and on areas that need improvement.  Audits will be conducted every three years to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the RMP standards are being followed. USA Yeast has an incident investig"

The purpose of the RMP incident investigation requirement is to ensure that: 1) incidents involving regulated substances are investigated, 2) recommendations for preventing a recurrence are identified and implemented, and 3) appropriate personnel are briefed on the causes of each incident. USA Yeast also has a management system and an applicability plan to implement and maintain the covered process in accordance with the RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental of aqueous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, USA Yeast will immediately notify local emergency responders that have been contracted (Complete Environmental & Remediation Company, LLC) to provide response in the event of anything greater than an incidental release. This response has and will continue to be coordinated.\n\n\n\nCHANGES TO SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe RMP Manual documents the required program elements for the covered process.  USA Yeast has developed a set of operating procedures that are contained within the RMP program.  These operating procedures are reviewed on an annual basis to maintain current and accurate instructions.  USA Yeast has developed a training plan to ensure that employees are knowledgeable in facility operations and to reduce the risk of accidents both during normal operations and emergencies.  Up-to-date instructions and continued employee training procedures will aid in future facility safety."
