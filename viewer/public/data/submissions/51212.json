The facility is located along the north side of 2nd Street, and has been at this location since 1957.  The nature of the business involves processing of paper pulp and other raw materials to manufacture cellophane film.  Our facility's process for liquefying paper pulp uses carbon disulfide in one of the initial steps.  The storage vessels T1001, T1002 and T1003 store carbon disulfide for use in this process, each with a nominal capacity of approximately 10,800 gallons.  Carbon disulfide is supplied to the storage tanks from an unloading facility designed to accommodate 4,400 gallon ISO tankers.   \n\nThe maximum on-site inventory of the three carbon disulfide storage vessels at the Innovia Films Tecumseh cellophane manufacturing facility is approximately 9,000 gallons (95,400 pounds) of carbon disulfide per vessel.  The ISO tanker (no more than one of these vessels is on-site at any time) contain a maximum of 90% of 4,400 gallons, and the vessels/equipment in the carbon disulfide recovery system contain a maximum of 3,000 gallons, based on an estimate by the plant engineer.   There is thus a maximum of 360,000 pounds of carbon disulfide on-site.  \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM & POLICY\nInnovia Films is committed to the protection of public health and the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation. Our company and our employees are dedicated to maintaining our carbon disulfide system in a safe manner.  We have clear lines of authority and responsibility with respect to all aspects of our release prevention program.  We maintain current safety information on carbon disulfide and our carbon disulfide equipment, and review potential hazards that may be associated with the storage and use of carbon disulfide at our faci"

      "SummaryText": "lity.  \n\nWe train both our operating and maintenance personnel in our procedures and safe practices.  New employees are trained before being allowed to work on carbon disulfide equipment without close supervision, and periodic refresher training is provided.  Any time significant changes occur in equipment or processes which could potentially impact the storage or use of carbon disulfide, affected employees are retrained.  We inspect and audit the carbon disulfide system, using both in-house staff and experienced professionals from outside the company.\n\nInnovia Films maintains and revises a body of process safety information; conducts periodic process hazard evaluations; maintains and revises operating proceedures; provides operations specific safety training; maintains a plantwide mechanical intergrity (maintanence) program; utilizes MOC and PSSR operations to enhance safety; requires hot work and confined entry permits for applicable operations; conducts and documents incident investigations; promotes employee participation in safety and operations efficiency; and requires contractor safety training prior to access to the facility.  Plant EH&S personnel submit a variety of performance reports that effectively audit site operations on a routine and periodic basis. \n\nThe plant is operated 24/7.  The plant is fenced to limit vehicle access and public access to the facility is restricted by a gate.  The operations area of the plant is lighted.  The plant has an audio alarm system.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM & POLICY\nInnovia Films maintains an employee Emergency Response Team and coordinates response actions with contract HazMat Teams and/or the local Fire Department and government response agencies as appropriate.  Innovia Films has developed a written emergency response plan and coordinates procedures with the Tecumseh Fire Department.  The plan designates specific actions and procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of carbon disulfide, and"

In the past five years there have been no adverse health effects to the public or public property damage.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nNo changes are planned.  Continued maintainence and revision of the Prevention Program elements are the basis of continuous safety improvement at Innovia Films."
