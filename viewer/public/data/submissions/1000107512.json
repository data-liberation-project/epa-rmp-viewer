In this facility, IVL-Pasadena handles Ethylene oxide (EtO) (CAS 75-21-8) in volumes that exceed the threshold quantity as prescribed under Table 1 of 40 CFR \u00a768.130. These processes are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is under Code 325199 of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  As such, the Program 3 Prevention Program is applicable.\n1.1\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nEthylene oxide (EtO) are used as part of various processes at the facility. The substances are stored in and unloaded from railcars, stored in tanks, and used in site reactors.  The same properties that makes EtO valuable to IVL-Pasadena sites production process also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and welfare as well as those of its employees, and to reduce the threat to the nearby population.  It is IVL policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which EtO is handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, and the safe handling procedures that are used and the training provided to personnel.\nIVL-Pasadena\u0092s emergency response program is based upon Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standards.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local emergency"
