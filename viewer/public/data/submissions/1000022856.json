Documents relating to Process Safety Management are maintained by Brad VanOosterum, Operator WT.\n\n\n\nPrimary activity and substances regulated under 40 CFR 68 are:\n\n?    The primary activity at the SBWWNPS is the pumping and treatment of municipal drinking water.\n\n?    The substance used at SBWWNPS which is listed at 40 CFR 68.130 is chlorine, used in the treatment of fresh water.\n\n?    The quantity of chlorine handled is (maximum) 8,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\nChemical Name:    Chlorine\n\nPhysical State (gas or liquid)    Gas (liquefied when contained, gaseous when released from pressure)\n\nResults based on RMP OCA guidance    Yes\n\nScenario (Explosion, Fire, Toxic Gas Release, Liquid spill and vaporization)    Vessel Leak\n\nQuantity Released (lbs)    2,000\n\nRelease Rate (lbs per minute)    200 (assuming 10 minutes to evacuate storage cylinder)\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nChemical Name:    Chlorine\n\nPhysical State (gas or liquid)    Gas (liquefied when contained, gaseous when released from pressure)\n\nResults based on RMP OCA guidance    Yes\n\nScenario (Transfer Hose Failure, Pipe Leak, Vessel Leak, Overfilling, Rupture Disk/Relief Valve, Excess Flow Valve Failure, Other)    Vessel Leak\n\nQuantity Released (lbs)    2,000\n\nRelease Rate (lbs per minute)    150 (assuming 13 minutes to evacuate storage cylinder)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe following is a general description of the accidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\n1.    The SBWWNPS continuously operates a SCADA system, which includes gas sensors for chlorine, automatic gas shutoffs and an alarm system.\n\n2.
