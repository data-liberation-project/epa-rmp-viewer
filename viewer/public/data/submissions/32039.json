The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nUnivar USA Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \u00bfWhat If Scenario\u00bf. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Univar USA Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass warehousing.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Formaldehyde (solution), Ammonia (aqueous) and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid.  All substances are warehoused for the purpose of resale.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (solution) at our facility is 34,299.00 lb. while Ammonia (aqueous) and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid are present at our facility in quantities of 27,979.00 lb. and 85,400.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from warehousing.  In this scenario 1073 lb. of Formaldehyde (solution) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 37% of the maximum capacity of the sourc"

The scenario involves the release of 56 lb.. The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by neutralization. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is 0.06 miles.\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde (solution) involves a release from warehousing.

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Univar USA Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 05/12/2004.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Univar USA Inc.. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nUnivar USA Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
