It fulfills the EPA\u00bfs requirements for updating RMPs once every five years.\n\nThis updated RMP summarizes the accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Criterion that minimize the public\u00bfs exposure to regulated substances used at the facility. Also presented, is a description of hypothetical worst-case accidental releases of aqueous ammonia (29% maximum concentration) from a 20,500 gallon aqueous ammonia tank. Passive mitigation equipment has been installed around our aqueous ammonia storage tank to minimize the surface area for evaporation during a spill.  Criterion qualifies for Program level 1 under the EPA RMP and CalARP regulations for  the aqueous ammonia processes.\n\nIn order to address the CCCHSD comments to Criterion in their preliminary determination report, dated May 14, 2003, following a site audit conducted in April 2003,, LFR has updated the worst case scenario (WCS) modeling for aqueous ammonia releases from indoor equipment and from outdoor pipelines using an EPA approved model ALOHA.  The results of the revised Off-Site Consequence Analysis are included in this RMP submittal.\n\nIn the previous submittal of the RMP, Criterion had included a worst case release analysis for vanadium pentoxide.  Criterion has since discontinued the use of vanadium pentoxide in their process and hence the WCS for vanadium pentoxide that was included in the earlier submittal has been removed from this updated RMP.\n\nCriterion\u00bfs aqueous ammonia usage is subject to both EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Prevention and California\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements for the development of a Risk Management Plan. The CCCHSD\u00bfs CalARP Program requires facilities subject to both Federal and State programs to update the RMPs once every five years.\n\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPON"

Criterion is committed to being a responsible member of the community by operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. This commitment is documented in our company\u00bfs policy on health, safety and environmental (HSE) performance.  Included in this policy are the following statements:\n\n\u00bfCriterion and Criterion\u00bfs parent company CRII is committed to:\n? Pursue the goal of no harm to people\n? Protect the environment\n? Manage HSE matters as any other critical business activity\n? Continuously improve our HSE Performance\n? Be recognized to be among the best in our industry in HSE performance\n? Promote a culture in which all CRII employees share these commitments\n \n We believe that:\n? All occupational illnesses, injuries and environmental incidents are preventable\n? Each individual is personally responsible for their own safety and for following established practices and procedures\n? Line Management is accountable for HSE performance\n \n We will have an HSE Management System designed to ensure compliance with the law and to achieve continuous performance improvement\u00bf\n \n The HSE policy is implemented through Criterion's Management System which is designed to identify and manage risk. Although not subject to OSHA Process Safety Management requirements, Criterion has developed many similar procedures to protect the health and safety of our workers, the public and the environment. The following summarizes the parts of the Management System that are most closely aligned with OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements:\n \nManagement of Change\n \nCriterion has a Management of Change (MOC) procedure requiring a comprehensive review of all proposed process changes.

Written documentation of department approvals, hazard evaluation, changes in process and instrumentation drawings (P&IDs) and operating procedures are maintained. \n \nPre-Startup Safety Review\n As part of the MOC process, Criterion requires that new or modified equipment meet all design requirements prior to operation. This review includes updating P&IDs, employee/contractor training, documenting operating/maintenance/safety/emergency procedures, environmental permits, information on chemicals (MSDS), and information on technology/equipment.\n \n Contractors\n \n Our contractor management program requires HSE review of each contractor. All contractors are required to complete training on the hazards and emergency response activities at the facility prior to starting work. Contractor activities are monitored to verify safe work practices and appropriate training. \n \n Safety Work Permit/Hot Work Permits\n \n All equipment installation and maintenance work requires use of a work permit process, including issuance of hot work permits where applicable. Each Safety Work Permit identifies the work to be performed, equipment involved, precautions to be taken, dates, and authorized signatures. For Hot Work Permits, fire prevention measures are also included. Copies of all permits are maintained.\n \n Training\n \n To ensure that processes are operated by competent individuals, training is a key component of our Management System. Initial training is given to employees at the time of hire. Subsequent training is given when there has been a change to the aqueous ammonia or any other system. On-the-job-training qualification is required for each operator, including an annual review of the aqueous ammonia MSDS.\n \n Incident Investigation\n \n Each HSE incident or near miss incident is analyzed and evaluated to determine the underlying cause(s).

This distance from the aqueous ammonia storage tank is within the property boundary. There are no public receptors within 317 feet of the tank, the facility has not had an aqueous ammonia release meeting the accident history criteria for five years and emergency response procedures have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response organizations. Therefore, Criterion\u00bfs aqueous ammonia process qualifies for Program level 1 under the EPA RMP and CalARP regulations.\n \n1.5 THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n \nCriterion has not had any accidental releases involving aqueous ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Criterion reviewed incident investigations from January 1999. This five-year accident history review satisfies the requirements of Section 2750.9 of the CalARP regulation. The purpose of conducting an accidental release review is to promote an informed community while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against reoccurrence.\n \nCriterion has established procedures to investigate accidents and recommend changes to operations to minimize the likelihood that a similar accident would occur again.

These include response and management of any accidental release and/or injury that may pose an impact to the community. These procedures are included in the Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP). Emergency response activities are coordinated with Contra Costa Fire located two blocks from the facility.\n \n 1.2 DESCRIPTION OF FACILITY \n \n Criterion\u00bfs Pittsburg facility manufactures a variety of catalysts for the oil and styrene manufacturing industries. Products manufactured are dry solids, containing alumina oxide, iron oxide, and other metals. The primary products are hydrotreating catalysts, an aluminum oxide based catalyst for petroleum refineries, and dehydrogenation catalyst, an iron oxide based catalyst for the manufacturing of styrene. One regulated compound is used above threshold quantity associated with EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Prevention and California\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention (RMP/CalARP) Programs, and is presented below. \n\nThe process covered by the RMP is Aqueous Ammonia in Above Ground Storage Tank (160,000 pounds)\n  \n   \n1.3 DESCRIPTION OF CHEMICAL USAGE \n \n1.3.1 Aqueous Ammonia Process \nCriterion has one 21,300-gallon aqueous ammonia storage tank. Due to administrative controls, the tank is limited to 20,500-gallons maximum capacity. The aqueous ammonia has a maximum concentration of 29% ammonia and the solution is stored at ambient conditions. The solution is used in two types of operations: 1) pumped as a liquid into mixing equipment or blending tanks; and 2) for use in air pollution control equipment.\n \nCriterion uses aqueous ammonia as a raw material during the manufacture of hydrotreating catalyst. Generally, the manufacture of hydrotreating catalysts is a two-step process: 1) the raw materials are mixed in a tank, the intermediate product is extruded, dried initially in an oven then in a kiln. This intermediate is used in step 2): the inte"

Liquid aqueous ammonia is pumped into mixing tanks during both step 1 and step 2 portions of the hydrotreating catalyst manufacturing process.\n \nCriterion also uses aqueous ammonia to reduce air emissions in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) air pollution abatement equipment. Criterion operates two SCR systems to reduce emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx). In these operations, aqueous ammonia is introduced into a process gas stream to convert NOx into nitrogen and water before being exhausted into the atmosphere. Liquid aqueous ammonia is pumped to an ammonia skid at each SCR, filtered, and then vaporized prior to being injected into the process gas stream. The ammonia is consumed in the process. \n \n1.4 THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n \nCriterion updated its offsite consequence analysis, using the EPA\u00bfs RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, and computer dispersion modeling to estimate impacts of potential worst-case scenarios (WCS) from our aqueous ammonia process. The compound is listed as a toxic material under CalARP regulations. The scenario that resulted in the largest quantity released traveling the furthest from point of origin was the failure of the aqueous ammonia storage tank. The updated Off Site Consequence Analysis results are enclosed in an attachment to this RMP electronic submittal. \n \n1.4.1 Aqueous Ammonia Process\n \nThe WCS associated with the Criterion\u00bfs aqueous ammonia process is the catastrophic failure of the aqueous ammonia storage tank resulting in the release of 20,500 gallons of 29% concentrated aqueous ammonia solution over a 10-minute period. In reality, this event is extremely unlikely since Criterion has many control measures in place that would prevent this type of event. Because the aqueous ammonia storage tank is located inside a concrete containment area, any release would be contained within the 800 ft2 diked area. In addit"

Criterion has coordinated our emergency response plans with local officials and satisfies the requirements of Section 2735.4(c)(3) of the CalARP regulation. \nWe developed the emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of hazardous compounds to employees. Computer dispersion modeling, along with using the EPA\u00bfs RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document, have demonstrated that worst-case releases of aqueous ammonia would not impact any public receptor. Except for very small spills, Criterion will not respond to releases of aqueous ammonia. Emergency response involving aqueous ammonia are coordinated with local fire department and Contra Costa County personnel. For very small spills that do not put employees or the community at risk, Criterion\u00bfs personnel will use proper personal safety equipment as required by the material\u00bfs MSDS.\n \nOur emergency action plan contains detailed procedures that outline how we respond to spills, injuries, fires, other emergencies, and how training, evacuation, notification and reporting is performed. Criterion\u00bfs emergency action plan includes instructions and lists of the telephone numbers of agencies and individuals that are to be contacted in the event of an emergency situation (e.g., fire, hazardous material spill, injury).
