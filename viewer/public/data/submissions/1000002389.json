High level of training of the operators.\nB.     Preventive maintenance program.\nC.     Use state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\nD.     Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the    participation of the operators.\nE.     Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures.\nF.     Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators in the awareness of the hazardous toxic properties.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program including training, Tampa Fire Department, Tampa Police Department and outside environmental "
