We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA?s RMP regulations.\n\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.\n\n?    An overview of our emergency response plan.\n\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOur facility produces polyurethane foam products using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  We manufacture flexible polyurethane foam into prime, rebond and molded foam products.  In addition, we blend polyurethane systems for use by other end product manufacturers.  In our process, we use the following chemical that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nToluene Diisocyanate (Mixed Isomers)    CAS No.:  26471-62-5\n\n\n\nWe have storage capacity for approximately 307,700 gallons of TDI inside the plant in fourteen (14) bulk tanks located in tank pits or diked tank farms.  Our rail siding has the capability for up to twelve (12) rail and/or boxcars.  We normally have about 3-4 railcars of TDI on hand at any given time.  A railcar "

Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by use of this chemical.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n?    Process safety information\n\n?    Process hazard analysis\n\n?    Operating procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Pre-startup review\n\n?    Compliance audits\n\n?    Incident investigation\n\n?    Employee participation \n\n?    Hot work permit\n\n?    Contractor compliance\n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nTDI unloading is conducted in accordance with accepted industry practices and in full compliance with internal operating and safety procedures.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems provide and have integrated these standards into the way we do business.  We also have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n \n\n\n\n5.2.4    Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nWe will keep records for all significant accidental releases that occur at our facility.  There have been no accidents involving TDI with off-site consequences during the past five (5) years, or the past twenty-four (36) years of operations in Elkhart.\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents on an on-site release in the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various f"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency responders.  Our response capability is limited to small spills and limited incidents.  Large spills are to be referred to local Hazmat responders for assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.6    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to review and potentially implement to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n?    Continue to provide training programs on the safe handling of TDI during unloading operations and routine maintenance procedures.  We will also focus on updating training materials and expanding the scope of employee training to a larger group of people.\n\n?    Explore the possibility of adding some type of containment to our rail siding to reduce the pool size created by a worse-case spill scenario."
