      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLampasas Butane Gas Co. - Copperas Cove, Texas\n\nOur facility has one 30,000 gallon storage tank, two 8,000 gallon storage tanks and equipment for receiving propane from truck transports and transferring propane from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to storing and transferring propane.\n\nAlthough propane is a flammable material, records of the state fire marshal show no fatalities at propane bulk storage facilities for as long as records are available (back to 1982).  In addition, we have never had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.  Specific safety features that we employ to minimize damage from any unusual occurrences include:\n\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose or line breaks.\n2. Pressure relief valves on each tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tanks.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained, and periodically retrained, in procedures that are in accord with Railroad Commission standards and the National Propane Gas Association's (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program.  In addition, we have coordinated with the Copperas Cove Fire Department to respond to emergencies.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This scenario involves a vapor cloud explosion from a release of the entire contents of the 30,000 gallon tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the impact from this scenario would extend 0.39 miles from our facility.  There are no schools, churches, hospitals, or parks within this distance.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA's worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose rupture for one minute due to a bobtail pull-away. According to information supplied by the EPA, the impact from su"
