      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nCity of Seguin, Texas developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to be implemented at the Geronimo Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (GCWWTP) in an effort to protect human health, to protect the environment, and to comply with applicable federal regulations.  GCWWTP is operated by the City of Seguin.  Physical location for the facility is 405 Seitz Road, Seguin, Guadalupe County, Texas. \r\n\r\nTo meet standards published in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68, City of Seguin has developed a RMP.  These regulations were promulgated by EPA to cover accidental release prevention provision under Clean Air Act 112(r)(7).  Those regulations require facilities exceeding cited threshold quantities of certain chemicals to develop a RMP.  Goal of a RMP is to focus on reducing risk of accidental release of certain chemicals; thereby, preventing harm to employees as well as potentially catastrophic impacts upon the public.  GCWWTP stores reportable quantities of chlorine gas (in excess of 2,500 pounds) at the site.  GCWWTP also stores sulfur dioxide gas but in quantities less than the 5,000 pound threshold established by EPA.\r\n\r\nEntrance to GCWWTP is controlled by fencing and locked gates.  GCWWTP is located in a semi remote location away from the general populace.  However, publicly traveled roads are in close proximity to the facility.  GCWWTP utilizes chlorine gas in its treatment process.  One ton cylinders containing EPA regulated materials are stored within ASME coded vessels.  During design and construction of GCWWTP, engineers used guidelines set forth by National Chlorine Institute.  All external piping is protected by channel iron.  Feed equipment is routinely inspected by operators.  All operators and other personnel working inside the facility have received instructions and training in safe handling of these gases as well as use of self contained breathing apparatuses.  Each employee is required to attend a class on how to read and interpret Materi"

If an emergency occurs, each employee will be assigned a specific task.  Risk management program is designed to enhance safety.  RMP details who will respond to a release to mitigate and evacuate appropriate areas and for sounding an \"all clear\" once leak(s) are contained.  RMP includes procedures for period review of readiness to react to a release.  Primary goal of the RMP is to maintain proper level of safety and retain proper records verifying training of employees.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM LEVEL\r\n\r\nEPA designates three program levels are defined as follows: \r\n1.\tProgram Level 1 pertains to a facility exceeding threshold quantities, but does not have any off-site consequence as determined by a hazard assessment.  \r\n2.\tProgram Level 2 pertains to facilities exceeding threshold quantities, has off-site consequences, but are not regulated by OSHA.\r\n3.\tProgram Level 3 pertains to facilities exceeding threshold quantities, has off-site consequences, and are regulated by OSHA.\r\n\r\nCurrently municipalities are not regulated by federal OSHA regulations and Texas does not have a state OSHA equivalent.  Off-site consequence analysis indicates that there is a potential for off-site consequences during a chemical release.  Therefore, GCWWTP falls under Program Level 2.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nRegulations outlines five specific requirements for Program Level 2 facilities.  By June 1999, each facility covered under the RMP program must have submitted a RMP to EPA.  EPA requests that all submittals be transmitted electronically on their form with appropriate figures.  Program Level 2 regulated facilities must conduct a hazard analysis, develop a prevention plan, implement an emergency response plan, and report any chemical accidents occurring within the previous 5 year period.\r\n\r\nGCWWTP Program Level 2 includes the following requirements:\r\n1"

Mishandling of chemicals can lead to severe injury or death.  Therefore, safe handling training is a vital component of employee training.  In addition, chemical interaction information should be made averrable to all employees, regardless of their individual assignments.\r\n\r\nCHLORINE\r\n\r\nChlorine is listed and regulated as an extremely hazardous chemical under Section 304 and can cause sever injury or death.  Chlorine is delivered to GCWWTP as liquified compressed gas in one ton containers.  Chlorine gas is not explosive or flammable.  However, it can support combustion.  Chlorine is a strong oxidizer and may react violently with other substances such as water, ammonia, oil, gasoline, etc.  Chlorine gas is denser than air (vapor = 2.49) and readily settles to low areas.  Chlorine gas is greenish-yellow in color and has a strong pungent, irritating odor with an odor threshold as little as 3.5 ppm.  At standard temperature and pressure, chlorine is equal to 2.76 milligrams per cubic foot of air.\r\n\r\nPrimary health hazard from chlorine exposure is damage to respiratory systems.  Chlorine gas can also irritate mucous membranes, eyes, and skin.  Death can occur by suffocation.  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lists 10-ppm of chlorine gas in as immediately dangerous to life or health.  NIOSH recommends a maximum safe level of 0.5-ppm of chlorine gas while OSHA regulations lists maximum safe level of chlorine gas as 1.0-ppm in air.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nFor each regulated chemical stored on site exceed threshold q"

      "SummaryText": "uantities, EPA requires performing a \"worst case\" analysis of off-site consequences for an accidental release.  EPA defines \"worst case\" as release of all contents from the largest container containing regulated chemical over a 10 minute period of time.  Analysis of the release assumes that atmospheric conditions are Class F, 77 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  \r\n\r\nAll regulated gases delivered to GCWWTP site are contained within a one ton pressure vessel.  Therefore, assumed release rates for all regulated chemicals at this site are 200 pounds per minute.  Off-site consequence analysis was conducted in accordance with Chapter 4: \"Off-Site Consequence Analysis of the General Guidance For Risk Management Programs\" dated October 27, 1998.\r\n\r\nEnd point concentrations used modeling of the release were based on requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.22 for a rural site.  End point concentrations are based on Emergency Response Planning Guidance (ERPG-2) concentrations.  ERPG-2 concentration is defined as \"airborne concentrations below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one (1) hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health affects of symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".  End point concentrations are as follows:\r\n1.\t0.0087 milligrams per liter for chlorine gas\r\n\r\nIn analysis of regulated gas releases, release at the GCWWTP was classified as rural.  Results of affected area analysis was as follows:\r\n1.\tChlorine Gas:  3.0 mile radius\r\n\r\nAn estimated population of 1,500 people live within the 3.0 mile radius as defined by \"worst case\" release of regulated gases.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nRegulations governing Risk Management Program require that an alternative releasee scenario alternative be performed in addition to the EPA defined \"worst case\" scenario analysis.

For all regulated chemicals, a 1-inch feed line was assumed to have broken or been sheared near the storage vessel.   Automatic shut-off valves are installed on the system, but considered to be in failure mode for this analysis.\r\n\r\nEnd point concentrations for regulated chemicals remain the same as in the \"worst case\" scenario.  Atmospheric stability used for alternative release is Class D (i.e., wind speed of 3 meters per second and ambient air temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit.  Alternative release analysis estimated a 0.5 mile radius of propagation for chlorine gas.  Alternative release analysis also classified the site as rural with end point distances calculated using EPA's RMP*COMP(TM) Model. \r\n\r\nSAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nPreparedness for an emergency when dealing with chlorine gas leak is essential since chlorine accumulation accentuates rapidly at standard atmospheric pressure once a leak occurs.  Whenever possible, no person should work alone during a chlorine leak.  Emergency plan of action should be implemented and include training of personnel who could become involved in a chlorine related emergency.\r\n\r\nEffective emergency response in handling chlorine leaks and spills depends on effectives and competence of the employees on site who can assess a situation and act accordingly.  It is the responsibility of supervisors to train their employees to use personal protective and other safety equipment properly.  It is also the responsibility of supervisors to educate their employees properly handling of chlorine and dangers related to mishandling of chemical.
