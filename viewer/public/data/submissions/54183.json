The Gateway Generating Station uses aqueous ammonia to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere and anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant media to chill cooling water that used to reduce the inlet air temperature entering the combustion turbine.  As the company responsible for operating Gateway Generating Station, PG&E takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia seriously.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\n1.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPG&E\u00bfs vision is to be the leading utility in the United States and PG&E\u00bfs values are presented below:\n\nWe act with integrity and communicate honestly and openly. \nWe are passionate about meeting our customers\u00bf needs and delivering for our shareholders.\nWe are accountable for all of our own actions; these include safety, protecting the environment and supporting our communities.\nWe work together as a team and are committed to excellence and innovation.\nWe respect each other and celebrate our diversity.\n\nThe Gateway Generating Station accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nAs a supplier of energy to approximately five percent of Americans and more than 40 percent of Californians, we recognize that th"

Immediately south and west of the site are existing industrial facilities. The river borders the north side, while a recreational marina, open space and additional industrial land uses occur east of the site.  \n\nThe Gateway Generating Station combined cycle power unit consists of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine generators, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), and one steam turbine generator. In the combined cycle process, electricity is generated from the combustion turbines and the steam turbine. Each combustion turbine generator converts the thermal energy of the natural gas fuel to mechanical energy, which drives the electrical generator. At the same time, the thermal energy from the exhaust flue gas off the combustion turbines is directed to the HRSGs to convert pressurized water into steam, which turns the steam turbine to drive the electricity generator. The facility also include two 195-foot tall exhaust stacks on the heat recovery steam generators, one air cool condenser system, a wet surface air cooler, an inlet chiller system, storage tanks, a control building, electrical power transformers, and transmission facilities to interconnect the generated electricity to the power grid. \n\nBoth anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia are used at PG&E\u00bfs Gateway Generating Station located in Antioch, California.

The management system has to be assigned to a qualified person or position that has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP.  PG&E has assigned the Plant Manager as the qualified person who has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP.  The Plant Manager is assisted by the Operations Supervisor, Plant Engineer, and the Maintenance Supervisor in the implementation of the RMP.  \n\nThe RMP and changes to it are communicated by supervisors to staff through normal day to day interaction, refresher training, regular safety meetings, and the management of change procedures outlined in the Process Modification section of the prevention program.\n\nThe management system activities are further discussed below:\n\nPlanning \u00bf Gateway Generating Station has an environmental, health, and safety policy that clearly defines PG&E\u00bfs goals and obligations.\n\nOrganizing \u00bf The Plant Manager is responsible for ensuring that written prevention procedures are in place and implements as described in the prevention program document.\n\nImplementing \u00bf The Plant Manager is respo"

Unless otherwise indicated, RMP records are maintained for five years. \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe prevention program elements described in the following section represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment.  The program elements such as process hazard analysis, compliance audits, and incident investigation result in the development of additional safeguards.  In addition, this facility is staffed 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  Some of the safety features of each ammonia process are described below.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Process\n\nThe chiller uses anhydrous ammonia in a closed loop process, eliminating the need for regularly scheduled deliveries of anhydrous ammonia after the initial charge of the receiver vessel. The chiller is equipped with a number of safety features including the following:\n\nFour ammonia leak detection sensors mounted around the chiller.  The detectors trigger both an audible local alarm and an alarm on plant Distributed Control System (DCS) when a concentration of 30 ppm of ammonia is detected in the air. This allows plant operators to immediately respond and investigate the alarm.  Additionally, the system can be shut down either through the plant DCS or through the local emergency shut down switch.  \n\nPressure and level indication\n\nPressure relief valves for the receiver vessel, the oil reclaim vessels , the evaporators, and the oil separators\n\nVibration alarms to indicate fan malfunction in the condensers \n\nAlarms are designed to annunciate in the control room with local audible alarms for ammonia releases at th"
