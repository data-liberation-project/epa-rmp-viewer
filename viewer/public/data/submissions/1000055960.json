This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia and sulfur dioxide processes, and only trained personnel are permitted to operate the systems.  Mission Bell Winery has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe Mission Bell Winery is located at 12667 Road 24 in Madera, California.  The facility utilizes several RMP-regulated processes to conduct operations, and they are described as follows.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used in the facility's refrigeration systems to provide cooling to either glycol or wine product.  In general, liquid ammonia is fed from a receiver to several chillers, where it is vaporized as it absorbs heat from the glycol / wine product.  The vapor is pulled off from the chillers by the compressors and discharged to the condensers.  At the condensers, the vapor is condensed back into liquid, which then drains to the receiver to be re-used in the refrigeration cycle.  The RMP-regulated refrigeration systems employed at Mission Bell Winery are listed below, along with their maximum intended inventory:\r\n\u00bf\t550 Refrigeration - 35,000 lbs\r\n\u00bf\tBlack Grape - 28,000 lbs\r\n\r\nAmmonia is also used as a neutralizing agent in a neutralization process.  Ammonia is fed from a storage tank to process water a"

Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place). \r\n\r\nIn addition, there have been no releases of ammonia from the 550 Refrigeration System, Black Grape System, and Ion Exchange/Vacuum Pan neutralization process that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  Nor have there been any sulfur dioxide releases in the last five years that meet the Federal Reportable Quantity of 500 pounds.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nMission Bell Winery has developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The ERP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) handling chemical releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and in-house emergency response personnel and 4) administering first aid measures for chemical exposure.  Employees perform drills and receive refresher training on the ERP.  In the event of a chemical release, trained emergency response personnel will assess the situation and contact the fire department as necessary for assistance.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits have been performed on the regulated processes, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.
