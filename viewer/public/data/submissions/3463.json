The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program  3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a 180,000 pound railcar of chlorine.  The scenario involves the release of 180,000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class D atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 44.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  .0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a Ton CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. \n\nWith Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 1.5 m/sec the maximum distance of 6.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a pipe  on the bottom outlet on the storage tank.  The scenario involves the release of 89,000 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 60 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 8.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydroflouric Acid involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage.  The scenario involves the release of 3262 lb. of Hydrofluoric Acid  in a liquid form over 4.5 minutes.

CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the HENDERSON FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide is received into Henderson in 180,000 pound railcars.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received into Henderson in 44,000 lb. tanktrucks. These product are then repackaged in different size containers for distribution to customers and in the manufacture of Sodium Hypchlorite, Sodium Bisulfite and Aqua Ammonia.  Hydrofluoric Acid is received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia  is also used  for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 794,550 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia  are present at our facility in quantities of 1,070,715 lbs., 121,680 lbs., 231,149 lbs.  and 242,131lbs.  respectively.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and th"
