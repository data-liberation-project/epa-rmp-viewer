These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\nThe primary business of C&S - Baldwin is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 37,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.\n\nThe Baldwin facility is located at 15500 Beaver Street West in Jacksonville, Florida.  The facility consists of areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution.\n\nOff-site Release Scenarios\n\nC&S has conducted an OCA based on the EPA document titled \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines,\" and used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07 to estimate the distance traveled to a toxic endpoint defined by the EPA regulation.

Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies with a maximum possible impact in the event of an accidental release. In considering these releases, the most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used. Passive mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative scenarios were developed to assess what potential impact may occur in the event of a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios for each of the regulated chemicals. Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\n\nProcess Description\n\nThe Thermosyphon Tank receives liquid ammonia from the condensers; it provides liquid ammonia to the High Pressure Receiver. The Thermosyphon Tank also provides liquid ammonia to all Compressor Oil Coolers. The High Pressure Receiver provides liquid ammonia to the +5\u00b0F Intercooler and the Glycol Chiller. The +5\u00b0F Intercooler provides liquid ammonia to the produce, dairy, meat, banana rooms, floral, seafood, milk, and dock area via liquid pumps. The +5\u00b0F Intercooler also feeds subcooled liquid to the -35\u00b0F Low Temp Recirculator. The -35\u00b0F Low Temperature Recirculator provides liquid ammonia to the 0\u00b0F and -20\u00b0F freezers via liquid pumps.\n\nThe evaporators maintain the appropriate room temperatures by transferring heat from the air in the room to the ammonia inside the coils, using fans to move air across the coils.

The +5\u00b0F Intercooler also collects the liquid/vapor mixture from these evaporators; the vapor returned is then drawn to the high stage compressors. \n\nThe Glycol Chiller is used to transfer heat from the glycol to the ammonia for the Banana Rooms. The Glycol Chiller utilizes high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver.  This high pressure liquid is expanded in the shell and tube section of the Glycol Chiller where it absorbs heat from the glycol that passes through the tubes.  As the ammonia absorbs heat it boils and collects in the Glycol Chiller surge drum mounted on top of the shell and tube section.  Glycol is chilled to a preset temperature by controlling the pressure in the surge drum through a pressure regulating valve where ammonia flows back to the +5\u00b0F Intercooler. \n\nAmmonia vapor from the -35\u00b0F Low Temperature Recirculator is routed through a suction header to provide suction for the booster compressors (BC-1 through BC-3). During the compression phase in the compressor, the temperature of the ammonia vapor rises and the pressure of the ammonia vapor increases. The low pressure booster discharge flows from the compressors via a vapor head to the +5\u00b0F Intercooler.\n\nThe high stage compressors (HSC-1 thru HSC-5) draw the suction return vapor that is collected in the +5\u00b0F Intercooler and compresses it to discharge high pressure vapor (hot gas).

In Automatic mode, the purger will sequence through the purge points condensing ammonia vapor in the purger chamber and purging any foul gas from the system. In Manual mode, an individual purge point can be selected.\n\nAmmonia sensors are located in the Engine Room and within each refrigerated space throughout the warehouse. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S - Baldwin to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.

The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of a low-level ammonia detection and cease operation of the refrigeration system in the event of a high-level detection.  There are also ammonia detectors located throughout the freezer warehouse that will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection in those locations.  An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the Maintenance Manager and Refrigeration Technicians.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (June 2019 - June 2024). There have been no releases of ammonia resulting in injuries at the facility either.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n- save lives;\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n- protect the environment; and\n- minimize property damage.\n\nThe program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  \n\nThere is a specific Corporate C&S program (CEHS-0042) which outlines the training, qualifications and"
