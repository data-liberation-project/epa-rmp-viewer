The liquids are then separated from the gas stream and further split into an ethane/propane product and a light gasoline/condensate product and removed from the plant by pipeline. The remaining natural gas is also removed by pipeline.\n\nThe Texas City Extraction Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Texas City Extraction Plant identified regulated substances and quanities kept on site.\n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Texas City Extraction Plant are propane and light gasoline/condensate.  Based on worst case analysis, distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors in addition, the Texas City Extraction Plant is subject to the OSHA regulation (PSM ??A? Process Safety Management).  Therefore, the Texas City Extraction Plant is classified as a program level process is 3. \n\nProcess Controls are in place at the facility, to prevent or minimize an emergency release, include various automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment.  In addition, the facilty is equiped with UV/IR detection and LEL/HAM (Hazardous Atmosphere Monitors).\n\nUnder EPA requirements the WCS assumes weather conditions that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible, and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are functioning.  Based on these assumptions, the WCS vapor cloud explosion could potentially effect nearby residences, commericial and industrial areas.  The process controls mentioned in previous paragraph minimi"

Facility personnel undergo operaitons competency training and testing including emergency response drills.  The response training and drills program includes notification to local emergency response agencies as available during the response training.  Agencies also receive applicable SARA Tier II chemical inventory reports annually.  In addition the facility is inspected and audited on a compliance schedule according to the PSM requirements.
