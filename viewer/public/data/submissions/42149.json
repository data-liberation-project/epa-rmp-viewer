      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Goodrich Aerospace Pueblo facility produces carbon brakes for aircraft.  Carbon textile material is received by the facility and is first cut, sized and prepared for the brake production process.  The textile is then sent to the furnace deck area where it undergoes carbonization and densification in a series of furnaces.  Next, the densified carbon brake parts are machined to the appropriate configuration.  Finally, the non-wearing surfaces of the brakes are coated with an oxidation inhibitor and mounting hardware is attached.  Some reprocessing of used brakes is also conducted at the facility.  In addition to the direct manufacturing activities, a variety of support operations are involved at the Pueblo facility.  On-site laboratories perform both research and development, and quality assurance/quality control functions.  Both routine and non-routine maintenance is also conducted on vehicles and equipment. \nPROPANE\n\nThe facility uses propane in the brake production process. The propane storage tank (18,000 gallon capacity) is located outside the southwest corner of the furnace deck building.   The maximum inventory of the storage tank is 69,000 lb propane.  The storage tank is designed and constructed in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and contains 2 safety relief valves.  The propane tank is protected from vehicle traffic within the facility by a guard rail. The perimeter of the facility is fenced and access to the site is controlled to prevent tampering.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario evaluated for propane at the facility involves the release of the entire tank (69,000 pounds) over a 10-minute period.  The propane is assumed to form a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to detonate. Ten percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion.  Other assumptions include Atmospheric"

USEPA's RMP*Comp version 1.07 was used to estimate the distance to the endpoint for this release scenario.\n\nThe endpoint (EP) is defined as the distance an explosion from an accidental propane release will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur.  For propane, the EP is an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  An overpressure below 1 psi is not likely to cause injuries that result from flying glass from shattered windows or falling debris from damaged structures.\n\nThe population within the estimated worst case impact area for propane is estimated to be 43 people, using the 2000 Census data and the LandView 5 database and mapping software package.  There are no environmental receptors within the worst-case impact radius.\n\nAlthough a worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP Rule, a worst-case occurrence is a highly unlikely event.  The possibility of a catastrophic failure of the storage tank is extremely remote because (1) the storage tank is designed and constructed in accordance with industry standards (i.e. ASME and NFPA 58 Codes); (2) the tank is equipped with two safety relief valves to prevent overpressurization and catastrophic release, (3) the perimeter of the facility is fenced and access to the site is controlled to prevent tampering; (4) the propane tank is protected from vehicle traffic within the facility by a guard rail; and  (5) the external surface of the tank is visually inspected on a regular basis.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is also required for the propane process, and is considered \"more likely\" to occur than the worst-case scenario, but must still be significant enough to impact off-site areas (i.e., achieve at least the EP at the plant fence line).

This scenario assumes that the tank is overfilled, and one of the 2-inch safety relief valves (set at 255 pounds per square inch gauge) lifts to relieve the excess pressure.  The valve is assumed to have a flow capacity of 8,300 Standard Cubic Feet (Air) per Minute, and is assumed to remain open for 5 minutes.  The \"Propane Guidance\" was used to estimate the distance to the EP, assuming the same vapor cloud explosion described in the worst-case scenario (the released vapor forms a cloud, of which 10 percent ignites).  The distance to the EP (1 psi) is calculated to be 0.13 mile.  There are no residential populations within this distance.  There are no environmental receptors within this impact radius.\n\nAlthough an alternative-release consequence analysis is required by the RMP rule, a failure and release of propane that is large enough to reach an EP beyond the fence line is not likely because the propane vendor follows a procedure designed to ensure that the filling of the tank is safely accomplished by qualified personnel.  Additionally, the tank is not re-filled until it has reached 30% capacity or less.\n\nMETHANE\n\nThe facility maintains a fleet of methane trailers.  The maximum inventory of methane is 24,000 lbs, and the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel in the process is 12,000 lbs.\n\nFor a worst-case release scenario, the facility must assume that the entire contents of one of the storage vessels (12,000 pounds) on a methane trailer is released, a vapor cloud forms, and 10% of the cloud detonates. Other assumptions include Atmospheric Stability Class F, an ambient temperature of 77?F, and 50% relative humidity.

A block is the smallest geographic unit for which the Census Bureau tabulates 100-percent data. Landview V will estimate the population within a radius as the sum of all Census 2000 Blocks whose centroids fall within that radius.  The centroid closest to the facility belongs to Block 2023, which is located to the southeast on the opposite side of Highway 50.  \n\nThe radius of impact (0.3 miles) for the worst case release scenario for propane includes the centroid for Block 2023, which has an associated population of 43 people.  The worst case radius of impact for ethane is smaller (0.2 miles), and does not include any Census 2000 Block centroids.  The worst case radius of impact for methane is the same size as that of ethane.  However, the methane pad is located further to the east of the facility and closer to the Block 2023 Centroid.

Although a prevention program is not required for the ethane system due to its Program 1 status, the ethane system is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations, and Goodrich has developed similar prevention program elements to satisfy the PSM requirements for the ethane system.  The key components of the RMP prevention program are summarized below:\n\n-The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of the process and the design of the system and equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the covered processes.\n\n-The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assumes that employees that utilize covered processes are the most knowledgeable about it and are able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n-The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on covered processes using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and/or What If study methods.  PHAs address:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failures; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.

They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n-Operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to covered processes.\n\n-Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\n\n-Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of a regulated substance are subjected to a formal investigation.
