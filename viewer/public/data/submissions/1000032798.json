While the effective and timely efforts by emergency responders prevented escalation or injury, the greater part of the unit was not restarted after the fire.\r\n\r\nOn June 20, 2009, a release of propane/propylene mix occurred when a loading hose separated from the connection on a contract carrier truck during offloading.  This incident caused an OSHA-recordable injury.  The incident investigation determined that significant degradation of the threads on the truck fitting allowed the initial release.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\nThe Facility maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and Sara Title III. Our Emergency Response programs are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required.  Our programs provide the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Contained in the programs are written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the facility.

When an emergency call is received by telephone or radio, the dispatcher at Communications Center has the ability to activate alarms that signal various facility personnel to take action. The level of response to the emergency is then adjusted as appropriate to the incident.  The dispatcher at Communications Center has the ability to pick up a direct dial telephone with local Fire Departments to request assistance or advise on the status of an emergency in progress. The Fire Department and the Police Department would use this information to make decisions on advising the public to evacuate or shelter in place.\r\n\r\nA vitally important part of the plant emergency organization is the Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The ERT is made up of full-time emergency response employees, as well as employee volunteers from various departments.  The ERT provides the personnel resources for a rapid and effective emergency response.  While most employees receive an incipient responder level of emergency response training, ERT members train and drill on a monthly basis.  Training and drill sessions include instruction and hands-on practice in the use of fire extinguishers, advanced interior and exterior fire fighting techniques, hazardous material response, confined space and high angle rescue, emergency medical response, the Emergency Response Plan and implementation of the Incident Command System.  \r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains its own dedicated emergency response equipment.  This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, breathing apparatus, encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, spill response boats and fire fighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and fire fighting foam.

Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public, and the environment. \r\n\r\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\r\n\r\nThe centerpiece of the accidental release prevention program is Process Safety Management (PSM).  The Facility has implemented a management system for PSM, which assigns responsibilities to specific individuals. The fourteen (14) elements of PSM, which are outlined below, constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the facility.  \r\n\r\nPSM Prevention Program Elements \r\n\r\n     1. Employee Participation\r\nEmployee participation is based on the principle that employee involvement in various areas of PSM is key to maintaining a Process Safety system that has an our attitude. Our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing PSM. Employees are involved in Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\r\n\r\n     2. Process Safety Information\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process covered by PSM and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process via an internal computer-based Intranet.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to"

This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our PSM program. \r\n\r\n     3. Process Hazard Analysis\r\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHA's are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \r\n\r\n     4. Operating Procedures\r\nWritten operating procedures are developed and implemented for all facility processes.  The procedures, written by experienced operating, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. \r\n\r\n     5. Training\r\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the process units are provided with initial training and periodic refresher training.  This training includes a general overview of the process, properties, safety and health hazards of chemicals in the process, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Training is conducted using a combination of classroom tr"

Mechanical Integrity\r\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI activities are trained on the procedures and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \r\n\r\n     7. Management of Change\r\nPermanent or temporary changes can inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of a process. A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the facility. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The Marcus Hook Facility uses a computer-based software program to assist in tracking and processing change requests. Results of the Management of Change process are documented and maintained in the software program, and made available to all personnel.         \r\n\r\n     8.

Compliance Audits\r\nA formal evaluation and certification of the PSM system is conducted at least every three years by an audit team. The compliance audit team seeks to confirm that PSM and RMP practices are consistent with written programs; the programs adequately address all requirements of the PSM/RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance. Facility management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and tracks all findings until they are resolved.\r\n\r\n     10. Incident Investigation\r\nAn experienced team promptly investigates incidents that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.  A systematic investigation process is used to determine the root cause of an event, analyze them and develop solutions to correct the situation and prevent it from recurring.  The investigation team then recommends and implements additional controls in order to mitigate hazards associated with the incident.  \r\n\r\n     11.

Contractors\r\nContractors are employed to supplement the facility's work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. A contractor screening procedure is used to help ensure that contractors are hired who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees, the public, or the environment.  Safety information is sent with all bid packages, and an evaluation of the contractor safety record and training program is used in selecting a contracting company.  The safety regulations require contractors to train their employees in the safe work practices and safety rules of the facility. The program also includes a facility overview video that is shown to all contractor employees to familiarize them with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be working.\r\n\r\n     13. Emergency Response \r\nOur Emergency Response Plan assures the readiness of employees to respond appropriately and safely to emergencies involving highly hazardous chemicals.
