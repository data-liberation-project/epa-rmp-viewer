Introduction:\n\nThe  Niota terminal is an ammonia terminal that unloads ammonia barges from the Mississippi River into a storage tank.  The ammonia is then loaded into trucks for transportation to agricultural distribution centers.  The facility has been in operation since 1967.\n \nThe Terminal, has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors since operations began in 1967.\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention and Record: \n\nThe  Niota facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths to plant personnel or contractors since it was constructed in 1967.   In addition, the plant has operated without a lost time accident for over thirty-two years.  There have been no RMP reportable releases of toxic chemicals in the last 5 years.\n \nC. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\nThe facility in Niota has incorporated a safety vision that states, ?We, the employees utilize teamwork, communication, and education, with the full support of management, to achieve safety excellence.?   The terminal employees utilize this vision statement as a reminder of the priority of achieving safety excellence.  Employees are highly involved in creating and implementing safety programs and safety systems at the facility, with a focus on continuous improvement.\n\nHighlights of the Safety Program include:\n\n?Extensive employee participation in the development, implementation, and review of safety systems and programs at the facility.  All employees participate in an annual evaluation of the safety programs at the facility.  \n\n?A well developed training program that ensures that employees are knowledgeable on the safety programs and their job duties.\n\n?Emergency response program training is conducted for all employees at the facility.

      "SummaryText": "ntion Program Steps:\n\n?The facility encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, networked computers that provide all employees instant access to up to date safety information, participation in Process Hazard Analyses, and continual employee training. \n\n?The facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.   Within this system, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n?The facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems. \n\n?Training of plant personnel includes: (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices. \n\n?The facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the processes.  This system requires that process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and verify that existing controls have not been compromised.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all affected personnel receive training on the change. \n\n\nF. Five Year Accident History:\n\nThe  facility has not had an RMP reportable accident in the last five years.  We are confident that the policies and programs in place at our facility will help us to maintain our record in the years ahead.\n\nG. Emergency Response:\n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plan covers accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, emergency response practices and procedures, and process safety topics.  The plan is reviewe"
