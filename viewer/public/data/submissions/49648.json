Changes contained in this Plan include an update to the five-year accident history, and inclusion a chemical previously not included in the RMPlan.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: Huntsman Polymers Odessa is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by Huntsman Odessa having earned OSHA VPP STAR status and ISO 14001 certification.  The Huntsman Odessa facility maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained workforce.  The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Polymers Odessa participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in January 1993, the Odessa Site has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n\n2. Regulated Substances: Huntsman Polymers Odessa is located in Odessa, Texas.  The Odessa site operates five Program Level 3 processes.  These processes receive, handle, and store flammable hydrocarbon feedstocks for the production of olefins and specialty grade polymers.  End uses include medical and personal care products, electronic cable coatings, adhesives and sealants, as well as boat and vehicle trims.  Huntsman's Odessa site has large volumes of several regulated flammable substances, such as ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butane, and butene.  The Odessa site uses small volumes of toxic chemicals, which are consumed in the process.  The toxic chemicals are:\n- Chlorine - Used for water treatment.\n- Vinyl Acetate - Used as a comonomer in the manufacturing of polyethylene.\n- Hydrochloric Acid - Used for water treatment. \n\n3.

This includes information pertaining to:\n- Hazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).\n- The technology of the process: Includes a discussion of process chemistry, process temperature and pressure, and chemical reactivity.\n- Equipment in the process: Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems, and design codes.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nHuntsman's Odessa site has performed a process hazard analysis on each process to identify potential hazards, adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls, and ways to minimize those hazards.  Huntsman Odessa utilizes the HAZOP  and What-if/Checklist methodologies, recognized and generally accepted methods for identifying and evalualting hazards in the process.  The Odessa site assigns associates to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nHuntsman Odessa maintains written operating procedures that were developed with the operators to provide clear instruction for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedure"

The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training in accordance with applicable standards.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nHuntsman Odessa has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing, and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nHuntsman Odessa has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to site personnel, process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.
