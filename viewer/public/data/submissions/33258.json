Simplot Company (Policy Statement EN 01.1) to manufacture, handle, store and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state and local environmental laws while reducing the risks to human health, safety and the environment. Each manager\\Supervisor is expected to responsibly implement this policy, and each employee is expected to comply fully with the spirit, as well as the letter of this policy. The Company will assure that the environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and standards applicable to its products and operations are known and obeyed by employees.\n\nThe J.R. Simplot Company Guideline (Guideline Statement SA 01.2) states that the Company is committed to reducing incidents or occurrences in the workplace that result in human injury, illness, or death, and/or destruction or loss to the corporation's assets and to be in compliance with all laws and regulations governing workplace safety. It is, therefore, our intent to provide a safe work environment and to protect the corporation's assets. This guideline applies to all groups and separate operating entities of the J.R. Simplot Company. Emergency plans shall be developed for each operating unit outlining the practices and procedures for emergency medical care, fire response, evacuation, or other emergencies. Each group shall develop and implement appropriate programs for initial and ongoing safety and loss prevention training of employees.\n\nRegulated Substance(s)\n\nThe substance(s) that are routinely stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia at or above the thresho"

Aqua Ammonia is stored and distributed to area customers as a source of land applied nitrogen fertilizer.\n\nAccidental Release Program\n         \nThis Anhydrous aqua ammonia facility implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; and CalOSHA standards at CCR Title 8 SubChapter 1 ?Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders?.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility had one accidental release of aqua ammonia in the past five years.  The volume of the release was below the reportable quantity.  No offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage resulted from this release.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194; and, California Heath and Safety Code Section 25503 of Division 6.95.  Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic, since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."
