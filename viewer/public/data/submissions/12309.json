Accidental release prevention\n7 Inspect all hoses and fittings for weak spots, loose connections, worn gaskets.\n7 Replace all parts, hoses, etc. that are not in good condition with approved parts.\n2. Emergency response policy.\n7 Remain calm\n7 Assess the situation\n7 Notify fire department of the existing emergency\n7 Evacuate people in the downwind path of the vapor cloud movement\n7 Prevent motorists from driving thru the area downwind of the emergency\n7 Approach the accident from the upwind side, after putting on protective clothing and a full face gas mask with ammonia canister\n7 Close the valve between the tank and the leak\n3. Facility and the regulated substances handled.\n7 Only anhydrous ammonia is handled at the facility.  There is one 18,000-gallon storage tank, 12 nurse tanks at the facility, filling stand, and a pump house.  It is located on the north side of the village.\n4. Worse-case release scenario.\n7 The worse case scenario is the release of 86,900 pounds of anhydrous ammonia into the air at a rate of 8690 pounds per minute.  The toxic endpoint would be 1.4 miles with a wind speed of 3.4 miles/hour.\n5. Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n7 We comply with the Illinois Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Products Inspection & Standards they inspect the facility yearly.\n6. Five year accident history\n7 The site has had no accidents is the past five years.\n7. Emergency response programs\n7 We are in cooperation with the Sheffield Fire Department.  They have practiced safety on the anhydrous tanks; their last practice on a tank of this size was in November 1998.\n8. Planned changes to improve safety\n7 We keep abreast of any necessary changes that need to be implemented through reading of various periodicals and attending required training sessions given by the Illinois Fertilizer & Chemical Association, Inc."
