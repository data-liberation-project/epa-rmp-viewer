The regulated processes at this location include repackaging and storage of Cyclohexylamine, Ethylenediamine, and Formaldehyde and the storage of \"factory-filled containers\" of Chloroform. These chemicals are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and are distributed to numerous customers who utilize these compounds for many applications ranging from water treatment, other chemical manufacturing, to pharmaceutical applications. The same properties that make these chemicals valuable also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling and storage to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community as well as to that of the people in our and company. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations. \n\nThe emergency programs in place at the facility include an Emergency Action Plan, a Fire Prevention Plan, and an Emergency Response Plan. \n \nThe EPA was mandated by law to define the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) as an unlikely event: the largest single storage vessel losing all of its contents in 10 minutes. For the regulated processes at the TAB Chemicals LLC facility, this scenario does not have off-site consequences to the public or to the environment.\n\nThe EPA terms a more likely incident an Alternate Release Scenario (ARS). An ARS could be a hose or small vessel leak. For this facility, the ARS also will not have off-site consequences. \n \nTAB Chemicals has a number of administrative controls in place to ensure the quality and safety of these products. These include regulating inventory levels; providing appropriate storage conditions; and verifications through audits and inspections of the processing equipment and conditions. All unusual operations and small leaks or spills are investigated to prevent recurrences. Routine process audits and training and testing of op"
