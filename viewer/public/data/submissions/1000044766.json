In addition to the PSM / RMP and CalARP Programs, US Growers has implemented various safety programs including forklift, lockout / tagout, and hot work procedures.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Growers Cold Storage facility is located at 3141 East 44th Street in Vernon, California.  All three \"areas\" utilize the same engine room. The maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the U.S. Growers Cold Storage facility is 18,000 pounds at the Areas 1, 2 & 3 plant.  These plants are connected, therefore the total inventory in this single process is 18,000 pounds of ammonia.  The three areas are connected via a common liquid and suction header.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The processes, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature; lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 2 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 134 psig on the high pressure side.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia that is stored on site is 18,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\n\n"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Growers Cold Storage facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, in particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\".\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds nor have there been any injuries resulting from an ammonia release in the past five years (June 2009 - June 2014).\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nU.S. Growers Cold Storage has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.)    To save lives.\n\n2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.)    To protect the environment.\n\n4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nU.S. Growers Cold Storage maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may a"

This Plan is reviewed and updated as needed.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nUS Growers Cold Storage has taken a pro active approach to emergency response and safety.  To improve safety, the ammonia refrigeration system is routinely inspected and audited.  The facility is currently in the process of completing recommendations made during the last compliance audit.  The facility will also be completing recommendations made during the last Process Hazard Analysis revalidation by June 2015.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility is planning to complete the following items over the next year in their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for its employees:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
