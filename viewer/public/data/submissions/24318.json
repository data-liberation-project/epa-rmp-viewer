The Paloma Station is a Liquefied Petroleum Gasoline (\"LPG\") / crude oil blending and transfer facility. The process is regulated by Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189 and Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program. This is an RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 facility. The facility is currently implementing the prevention program described below.\n\nCoastal Petroleum has a commitment to employees and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of covered processes. Coastal's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe prevention program is based on 40 CFR Part 68 and Title 19 CCR 2735. The program includes the following areas: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits. Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the Process Safety Management audits and revalidation of the Process Hazard Analysis. Training includes employee responsibilities in the Process Safety Management program, Emergency Response, Hot Work Permit Procedure, Code of Safe Work Practices, and Operating Procedures.\n\nThe facility stores and unloads natural gasoline. There are 12 tanks with various capacities ranging from 37,"

The tanks are administratively controlled to hold liquefied petroleum gasoline at 90% maximum capacity; therefore the worst-case flammable scenario is based on a 94,500-gallon release.\n\nCoastal Petroleum maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies. Paloma Station has a Hazardous Materials Business Response Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department - Certified Unified Program Agency. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area. The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release. This information was verified by reviewing records from the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is based on the Environmental Protection Agency Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance equations and model. The worst-case scenario and alternate release scenario were based on n-butane as the modeled substance. The facility stores and transfers primarily natural gasoline, of which n-butane is a component. The worst-case release of 472,900 lbs of liquefied petroleum gas and indicates a one (1) psi overpressure distance of 0.63 miles. This distance impacts public receptors of an adjacent farm, gas plant, and a resident population of 13. In addition, although there are numerous controls in place, no credit was taken into account for evaluating the worst-case scenario. The Alternative Release Scenario for this process is a break in transfer hose connection. This scenario could result in release of 60 lbs of liquids over a ten-minute period. The maximum distance for this scenario is 0.03 miles. The process maintains mitigation measures such"
