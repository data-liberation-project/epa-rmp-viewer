The Beaver Street facility has over a threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated highly hazardous chemical per EPAA?s 40 CFR-68.  Beaver Street has a unified Risk Management Program as well as OSHA Process Safety Management program that are presented in this plan.\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\nBeaver Street Fisheries, Inc. accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68,  Prevention Program.\n1.1.1.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\n        Beaver Street has a management system in place which is lead by the FisheriesA? Vice President, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other facility-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of an ammonia release at the facility.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plantA?s RMP Process Safety Information.\n \n    \n1.1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\n        Beaver Street Fisheries, Inc. maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus RMP elements needed to implement the program.  These are maintained in the Beaver Street plant Document Management System (DMS).  The unified PSM/RMP program was implemented in 2004 prior to increasing the maximum inventory above the 10,000 pound threshold.\n1.2.    THE BEAVER STREET FISHERIES, INC.

SITE DESCRIPTION  (B)(1)\n    The site is owned and operated by Beaver Street Fisheries, Inc.  The site is located at 1741 West Beaver Street, City of Jacksonville, in Duval County, Florida.  The site is located in an area, boarded by Robinson Avenue on the west, Railroad Tracks on the east, McQuade Street on the north and West Beaver Street on the south.\n    The Plant includes a separate ammonia operation storage building and adjacent control room system.  The boundaries of the ammonia system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Ammonia Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent makeup and exhaust systems.  Ammonia is delivered to numerous refrigerator units and returns to the compressor room where it is liquefied for further use.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.2.2.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\n        Anhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule 10,000 pound EPA and OSHA threshold quantity.  Beaver StreetA?s ammonia process was installed as part of the process of supplying plant refrigeration.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The ammonia is stored in a receiver and distributed to the refrigerator process control systems. \n    Anhydrous ammonia is an EPA listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  AmmoniaA?s formula is NH3.  The OSHA PEL is 50 ppm.  It is flammable and is a gas at standard conditions.  Ammonia is liquefied by compression.\n    \n1.3.

The alternative scenario is defined as A?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarioA?.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the A?toxic endpoint.A?  The EPA specified endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/l. This endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the A?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individualA?s ability to take protective action.A?

WORST CASE   (c)(1)\n    Atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions outlined in RMP-Comp.  Results demonstrate a distance of 0.9 miles to the toxic endpoint.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at 7,815 people.*  There are churches, schools, residences, recreation, industrial, plus historic areas included in that release area.\n1.3.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\n    The alternative release scenario involves the failure of a pipe or valve in the ammonia system.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in a pipe, valve or even a vessel.  Model"

Facility Design\nThere is an ammonia storage process area:  the compressor room.  Liquefied ammonia under high pressure is supplied via a pipe network to numerous refrigeration and freezer systems.   The high pressure ammonia evaporates to a gas in the refrigeration or freezer systems.  Then this Ammonia gas is drawn back into the condensers located above the compressor room.  Here the gas is re-liquefied by the condensers and flows back to receivers and is fed to the suction side of the compressors located in the compressor room.  The liquefied ammo"

The plant and support equipment of the ammonia compressor room and control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.

The room is also equipped with an ammonia monitor and the system has an emergency shut down located in the adjacent control room.\n1.4.2.3.    Equipment Design\nThere are two types of ammonia pipe systems, high pressure liquid supply lines and medium and low pressure vapor return lines.  The high pressure ammonia piping system is made of ammonia compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or ammonia compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by ammonia) rated to 2,500 psig.  The typical pressure of the ammonia in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a substantive safety factor.  This system is extensive, leading from the ammonia compressor room to each of the individual refrigerator or freezer units.  \nThe medium and low pressure system operates under a positive pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also ammonia compatible.  Ammonia from the freezers returns at six psig and ammonia from the refrigeration units retunes at 20 psig.  The high pressure system is designed using schedule 80 seamless pipe and fittings designed 2,500 psig giving it a large safety factor over the typical positive pressure in the high pressure system. The low pressure system  uses schedule 40 pipe and fittings and is rated from 450 to 1.000 psig.  The low pressure system operates at 6 psig for freezer return lines and 20 psig for refrigeration return lines. There is an ammonia monitor which detects the presence of ammonia in the compressor room storage area.  \n1.5.
