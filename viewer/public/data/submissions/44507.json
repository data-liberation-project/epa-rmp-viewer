In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. \n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, practices and procedures which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nThis is an old facility with an old ammonia refrigeration system and a new owner. There are two separate systems in site; one for the main process plant and cold storage facilities and one for the ice house and ice storage system. The total ammonia on site is currently 14,300 lbs. The accidental release prevention program is based on extensive training and maintenance and past history. \n\nThere have not been any releases in the last five years.\n\nThe worst-case scenar"

      "SummaryText": "io was considered to be a rupture of the high pressure receiver. The end point radius is 1.1 miles. The possible rupture is not mitigated by any factors. This system is protected by relief valves which are well maintained, making the failure unlikely.\n\nThe alternate scenario considered was a leak in a high pressure ice house ammonia pipe or high pressure receiver which is a separate system and located at the north edge of the property. The end point radius is 0.1 miles. The catastrophic failure is unlikely because the system is protected by relief valves, a preventative maintenance program and regular inspections. Ammonia is not corrosive to the piping materials.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program relies on extensive maintenance, training, and standard operating procedures. All areas of the system are protected by relief valves which discharge into the atmosphere.\n\nThe emergency response program is a two-level program that is monitored by ammonia detectors located in the engine room. The first level alarm is a threshold alarm which will notify the refrigeration operator that a threshold amount of ammonia has been detected. The second level alarm (1000 ppm) will kill all power to the machinery room and begin the emergency ventilation system.\n\nPlanned changes at this time include improving piping insulation, increasing and standardizing operator training, and increasing emergency drills. The administration and maintenance of the program will be undergoing a continual evolution to maintain a smooth operation without any difficulties.\n\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\n\nSteve Meuter\nPlant Manager"
