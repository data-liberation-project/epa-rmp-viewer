      "SummaryText": "In January, 2005, Cargill Juice Beverage Applications(Cargill) acquired part of the citrus processing plant owned by Pasco Beverage in Dade City, Florida.  The plant include operations for processing and storage of citrus juices as frozen, concentrated, and ready-to-drink products. This type of production requires refrigerated processing and storage areas to maintain the quality of the finished product.  For this reason,  two ammonia refrigeration processes are in operation at the facility to provide cooling in the production and storage areas.  After the acquistion, Cargill modified the refrigeration systems that service their portions of the facility to operate independently from the portion of the plant owned by Pasco Beverage.  As this created new refrigeration processes with new ownership, Cargill concluded that separate RMP Programs were required for their processes.      Cargill Juice North America requires each plant to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an Emergency Action Plan appropriate to the operations at the site.  In addition to the EAP, the Cargill Dade City Plant has implemented an accidental release Prevention Program that is equivalent to an OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  The PSM/RMP Prevention Program includes written Operating and Maintenance Procedures,  Safe Work Practices, Process Safety Information, and employee Training.  The previous owners, Pasco Beverage,  performed a Process Hazard Analysis in June of 2004.  Cargill Juice plans to perform a new PHA to ensure that they have identified and addressed any hazards that may be present in the new process configurations.  Cargill also has Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Incident Investigation, and Contractor Safety procedures.  All employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration processes are trained on the written procedures, safe work practices, and ammonia hazards."
