The AWP consists of several water purification treatment processes, including Chlorination, Filtration, Flocculation and Sedimentation.  \n\n\n\n     Chlorine gas has been in use for nearly a century as the choice disinfectant in the treatment of both sewage for discharge and surface and ground water for drinking.  Currently the AWP maintains a maximum inventory or 18,000 pounds of Chlorine gas.  Under EPA's Risk Management Program, Clean Air Act 112(r), any industry utilizing Chlorine, a regulated gas, above the threshold level of 2,500 pounds, must develop a Risk Management Plan and implement a Risk Management Program.  \n\n\n\n     The AWP, in implementing their Risk Management Program (RMP), is currently undergoing changes in both process design and operations, as well as improving on their emergency response preparedness plans.  In the spirit and law of the RMP, the AWP recognizes and is pursuing optimal public involvement in response to regulated substance emergencies.  The AWP acknowledges that as a result of being in compliance with the RMP Rule, the safety of  the surrounding community as well as that of on-site workers is significantly enhanced.  From improved record-keeping, training, operating procedures to better engineering design, the AWP is dedicated to minimizing the risk of using Chlorine gas while at the same time improving the quality of local services.  \n\n\n\n     Chlorine gas is required at the AWP for disinfecting surface water pumped in from nearby Lake Guntersville, as well to add a \"polish of residual Chlorine\" to finished drinking water leaving the facility.  The AWP recognizes that Chlorine gas, if accidentally released into the environment, may cause severe injury and eve"

The Albertville Water Works General Manager is Mr. Elden Chumley ((256) 878-3761).  Primary responsibility for the implementation of the RMP is under the direction of the Water Superintendent Mr. Ronnie McCullars.  Mr. McCullars' primary responsibility under the RMP will be to oversee the training and execution of the facility's health, safety and environmental programs.  Additional individuals may be assigned responsibility for implementing individual requirements and will report to Mr. Ronnie McCullars on delegated matters.  Responsible individuals will communicate information to other employees involved in operation and maintenance of the regulated process involving Chlorine gas, as required.  All responsible individuals so involved will be listed by name, title and duties, in the RMP located on site at this facility.\n\n\n\n    Any material changes in the design or maintenance [except for \"replacements in kind\"] of the current regulated process will be introduced into the RMP by those delegated that authority under the guidelines of the RMP.

The AWP is prepared to assess and repair incidental or controlled leaks of the regulated materials but is currently not authorized to respond to uncontrolled releases of Chlorine from their facility.  Instead, the AWP has coordinated first response assistance from federally regulated Hazardous Materials (HazMat) specialists.  Currently the Albertville, Guntersville and Albertville Fire Departments have joined together for first response action should an uncontrolled release of Chlorine gas occur on the AWP site.  In coordination with local and nearby Police and Sheriffs, residents will be evacuated systematically, and as soon as decisions are made by the Emergency Coordinator (Fire Department) and others in the Emergency Chain-of-Command.    \n\n\n\n     EPA requires each regulated facility to analyze a Worst-Case Scenario release (the release of the entire contents of a regulated substance container) as well as an Alternative-Case Scenario in which the released regulated gas is brought under control at some point following uncontrolled release events.\n\n\n\n     In the Worst-Case Scenario, detailed within the facility's RMP, a scenario is considered in which the uncontrolled release of the entire contents of a ton container of Chlorine gas occurs.  There are no mitigation features included in this Worst-Case analysis, such as enclosed buildings or other structures, for the uncontrolled release of the regulated substance.

Close to the source of such a release the potential for serious injury is high. \n\n\n\n     Of particular concern is the slough running east to west behind the AWP into Lake Guntersville.  This waterway is home to a popular sand bar, where many boaters spend the day on a regular basis during the summer.  Topographical features around the plant suggest that, notwithstanding a strong North to South wind, the chances are favorable for a cloud of Chlorine gas to escape downhill, move into the slough's valley, and move toward this popular beach.  The AWP is preparing to post warning signs as well as install a siren which can be recognized and heard from this beach.  All fire crews and other first responders are aware of, and implementing new strategy in preparation for, a possible emergency concerning this sensitive gas receptor site.\n\n\n\n     The safety mechanisms in place at the AWP designed to prevent this scenario from occurring include vacuum regulator valves on the ton containers themselves. These valves release Chlorine gas only when a vacuum is applied, hence, if a line should break in the Chlorine process manifold system the valves on the source will automatically shut off when the vacuum is lost.\n\n\n\n     Although the potential for an entire ton container of the gas to escape the Plant's boundaries is unlikely, it can happen.  The EPA requires all responders to such a release to coordinate with the local Emergency Management Agency, the Fire Department, HazMat specialists and other local authorities such as the Police Department and Sheriff's office, in order to effectuate the best plan for evacuation efforts, if needed, and other requirements to assure the greatest protection for those who may be exposed to the gas.

For example, local Schools, Hospitals and other sensitive receptor sites are currently being integrated into the community's Emergency Response Plan through the efforts of the Fire Department, LEPC, Police Department and others.

This building is 150 feet from the Main Office at the AWP.  The AWP maintains two Chlorine detectors which is set to activate a local and remote alarm system at 1 parts per million concentration.  This detector is tested everyday for response.  The Chlorine building is equipped with automatic closure of all doors and relatively tight containment of the internal atmosphere (which is environmentally controlled).  In the event of a partial release of Chlorine gas it is anticipated that the bulk of the gas will be contained within the immediate vicinity of the Chlorine room.  \n\n\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of Chlorine gas beyond incidental events, such as minor leaks, in the last five years.\n\n\n\n     During the development of the AWP's RMP Program several recommendations were made which are currently being addressed.  Recommendations were introduced for windsocks, sirens, upgrading engineering process materials and instruments, and further upgrading of AWP's standard operating procedures for all process activities which are material to the Chlorine process.  From these Standard Operating Procedures training will be maintained to current industrial standards, and documented assuring that all Operators at the Albertville Filter Plant are competently trained in the design and everyday handling of Chlorine gas.\n\n"
