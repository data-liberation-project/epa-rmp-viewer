It is the company\u00bfs policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident and environmental pollution prevention, such as training personnel, and considering those factors in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the accidental release.  This facility complies with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 58 requirements for liquefied petroleum gas storage.\r\n \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nGas Innovations is an independent wholesale provider of gases to industrial gas and welding distributors.  Their facility located in Harris County, Texas, also provides other services such as ultrasonic testing for cylinder re-certification and re-qualification, hydrotesting, cylinder restoration (blast and paint), cylinder decommission, visual inspection and certification, internal wash and clean, and de- and re-valve, among others.  Gas Innovations was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances, as defined under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, was used, stored, manufactured, or handled in any process on site in exceedance of the threshold quantity established on 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Based on process knowledge, Gas Innovations identified seven (7) regulated substances that are stored on site and used in the process in quantities that exceeded the threshold value.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substances that are handled at this site in e"

Gas Innovations also handles Hydrogen Chloride in exceedance of its threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.  These gases are distributed to clients in bulk or cylinders.  These regulated substances are stored at the site in bulk process storage tanks.  These tanks are filled between 85% and 88% of their capacity.  The expected quantities stored and used at the site of these regulated substances vary from 17,000 pounds to 62,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\n \r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nGas Innovations has implemented an emergency response program that includes incident prevention and investigation.  The bulk storage tanks are equipped with release prevention devices that include emergency shut-off, manual valves, purge flow valves, relief valves, high pressure regulators and back check valves.  The equipment is included in a prevention maintenance program as recommended by the equipment manufacturers.\r\n\r\nGas Innovations is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rules.  The site has performed process hazards review to the regulated processes under the Risk Management Program (RMP), which includes the flammable gases and the hydrogen chloride storage and handling processes.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the past five years Gas Innovations has had no accidental releases of the regulated substances that can cause death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Response (ER) program which has been coordinated with the community.  The facility\u00bfs ER program includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of the regulated substances.  The facility's ER program includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responding to accidental releases at the site."

Periodic safety and pollution prevention reviews are performed of processes, procedures and the facility in general, to assure the site complies with all applicable regulations in the prevention of accidental releases that can affect the safety and health of its employees, the surrounding community and the environment.\r\n\r\nRMP Submission\r\n\r\nThis RMP is being submitted after the June 6, 2013 deadline.  Prior to the deadline, on June 3,2013, various people including Edward Richman of the EPA were notified of the difficulties we were experiencing and verbally approved a later submission.  There are several reasons for the late submission; including the fact that an Electronic Signature Agreement (ESA) was not in place and had to be created in order to complete the electronic submission; and although the ESA was approved, the ESA code was not provided and required several days to obtain.  Now that the ESA in place future submissions will be completed on a timely basis."
