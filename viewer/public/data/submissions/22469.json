      "SummaryText": "Dow Chemical Torrance, CA Site\nGeneral Executive Summary\nJanuary, 2001\n\n\nSection 1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company (\"Dow\") has a long-standing commitment to worker and public \nsafety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, \nsuch as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and \nmaintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent \nforeseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained \npersonnel will respond to isolate and deny entry and control the release to the extent possible.   \nDow personnel will also notify the Torrance Fire Department who will assume command of the \nincident, if necessary, until the release is stopped.\n\n\nSection 2.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Dow facility, located in Torrance, CA, primary activities are the manufacturing of \npolystyrene plastic and polystyrene foam products.  Acrylonitrile is the only regulated \nsubstance present at our facility, and is used to manufacture ABS (Acrylonitrile-Butadiene \nRubber-Styrene Polymer) plastic.  ABS resins have unique chemical resistance, toughness, \nand high temperature properties that make them especially suitable for a number of end uses\nincluding automotive parts; drain, waste, and vent pipes; small appliances; electronic equipment\nhousings; housewares; toys; and many more.\n\nThe Torrance Plant is one of many locations in North America and Europe in which Dow produces\nABS plastic resin.  Dow has been producing ABS resins since the early 1960s and remains today\none of the largest producers worldwide.\n\nProduction of ABS in Torrance started in 1972 to meet West Coast demand as well as export \npportunities.  ABS continues to be a vital component of the portfolio of products offered by Dow to\nits global customers\n\n\nSection 3.  Worst Case Scenario \n    "

      "SummaryText": "              Alternative Release Scenario with Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures  \n\nThe EPA's RMP regulation covers the acrylonitrile storage tank and tank car unloading process\nand the ABS production process equipment.  This regulation requires Dow to analyze these\nprocesses to determine the worst case release scenario and an alternative, or more likely,\nrelease scenario.  The worst case release scenario submitted for these processes involves a \ncatastrophic release of 274,000 lb. of acrylonitrile from an acrylonitrile storage tank.  The tank's\ncontainment dike was considered as a passive mitigation system when evaluating this scenario.  \nPassive mitigation systems are those devices, equipment, or technologies that function without \nhuman, mechanical, or other energy source.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released \ninstantaneously, to form a liquid pool.  The amount of acrylonitrile that vaporizes in this worst case \nscenario forms a mixture in air, which a person can be exposed to for an hour, without experiencing \nserious health effects.  This mixture would be experienced beyond the Dow Chemical facility fence\nline\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the acrylonitrile storage tanks, just as in the worst case \nscenario.  In the alternative release scenario, it is assumed that a 2 inch opening develops on one \nof the storage tanks, resulting from the failure of a 2\" piping connection to the tank, or a partial \nfailure of the tank itself.  The liquid acrylonitrile would be released at rate of 1262 pounds per\nminute into the tank dike forming a contained liquid pool.  It is assumed that the release would last\nfor 10 minutes, for a total liquid release amount of 12,620 lbs.  This is a reasonable time frame for\noperations personnel to become aware of the problem and take appropriate actions to stop the \nrelease.  It is assumed that the release would be detected by the flammable gas detector located\nin the dike, which would sound in an "

The active mitigation measure for the acrylonitrile storage tank system is the deluge\nfire protection system with fire fighting foam capability.  Fire fighting foam, applied to the surface of\na liquid pool, reduces the liquid evaporation rate.  Active mitigation systems are the converse of\npassive mitigation systems, in that they require human, mechanical, or other energy sources to\nfunction. The release is also controlled by monitoring and detection systems including:\n1) flammable gas detectors, and 2) sensors measuring pressure, temperature, and level.  Based\non the alternative release scenario, the concentration of acrylonitrile in air would be experienced\nbeyond the Dow Chemical facility fence line, which a person can be exposed to for an hour,\nwithout experiencing serious health effects.\n\nThe EPA RMP*Comp(TM) methodology, developed by the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA), was used to model both the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\n\nSection 4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  All facilities at the Dow Torrance, CA \nsite were designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Fire \nCode, and all other applicable codes and standards in place at the time of construction.  A \nnumber of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR \n1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.

Dow employees are also \nencouraged to intervene in unsafe acts to prevent injury to other employees.  Employees have \naccess to all information created as part of the Torrance site Injury and Illness Prevention \nProgram.
