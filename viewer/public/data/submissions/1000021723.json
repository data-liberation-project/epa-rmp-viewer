Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  The Walnut Energy Center is owned by the Walnut Energy Center Authority, a joint powers authority comprised of the Turlock Irrigation District and the Merced Irrigation District.  The Turlock Irrigation District is responsible for operating Walnut Energy Center.  As such, it takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as it takes controlling emissions from the power plant.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps the Turlock Irrigation District takes every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Walnut Energy Center accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nTurlock Irrigation District recognizes the responsibility to make its environment, community and employee safety a primary part of our daily concerns.  Turlock Irrigation District is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
