THIS RELEASE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 15 AREA RESIDENTS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A RELEASE OF 11,908 POUNDS OVER A TWO-MINUTE RELEASE PERIOD.  THIS RELEASE WOULD HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENPOINT OF .83 MILES AND WOULD AFFECT 2 PEOPLE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.\n\nTHIS COMPANY MAINTAINS AND OPERATES THEIR NH3 PLANT IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ALL FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
