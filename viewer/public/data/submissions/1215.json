The Facility Policy\n\n       The owners, management, and employees of Wathena Grain Company are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.   If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n   2.  Facility Information.\n\n       The primary activity at this facility is buying, selling and storing grain and retailing farm supplies\nincluding the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n       Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n       The maximum quanity stored would be 140,195 pounds (84,117 pounds in 18,000 gallon tank and 56,078 pounds in 12,000 gallon tank).  The maximum quanity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 160,000 pounds.\n\n   3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a rail car released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 160,000 pounds which represents the volume of the rail car at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.\n\n       b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\n   4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n       We have implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\""

      "SummaryText": ", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n   5.  The Five-year accident history.\n\n       a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in  place,  property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n   6.  The emergency response program.\n\n        We have:\n\n       a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n       b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title lll (EPCRA).                     \n\n       c.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n   7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n       Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaulations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
