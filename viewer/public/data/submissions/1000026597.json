This filtration plant is owned by the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) wich is a Goverment Agency. PRASA has developed the RMP following 40 CFR Part 68 for the Prevention Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of chlorine (the toxic substance) used for water disinfection. The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as establish in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release:\n\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Las Marias Filtration Plant is being built with specific engineering controls. As a new facility, soon to be inaugurated, it includes safety improvement and written procedures (as part of the Prevention Plan) to be implemented to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediate sorrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled:\n\nLas Marias Filtration Plant is located close to the river that serves as the supply of raw water. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy pathogenic microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered from tha PRASA Chlorine Warehouse and Distribution Center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in 1 ton containers. Las Marias Filtration Plant could have a maximun storage capacity of 10,000 lbs of chlorine distributed in five (5)containers. The containers are connected to chlorinators from wich the chlorine flows to the ejectors and then the chlorinated water is sent to different disinfection points along the process of the plant.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined following the Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Gu"

      "SummaryText": "idance for Waste Water Treatment Plants. The worst-case release scenario is a gas release of the entire content of a ton container over a ten minute period (200 pounds per minute). Other worst-case assumptions  required by EPA include low wind speed (1.5 meters per second) stable atmosphere (class F), urban topography and no active mitigation of the release. EPA requires the determination of the area (zone of vulnerability) wich may be exposed to a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm or greater. According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association, 3 ppm is the maximun concentration of chlorine in air bellow wich nearly all people could be exposed for one hour without serious helth effects. Base on the worst-case assumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extend 1.3 miles from the chlorine storage area. Using the Marplot and US Census 2010, it was identified that 1,206 residents are inside the 1.3 miles ratio. No known environmental receptors (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this ratio area. The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Progarm was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated following the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 lbs container, but throughout a 3/8 pipe leak at the rate of 21 pound of chlorine per minute over a 95 minute period. More typical weather conditions are also used 9wind speed of 3.0 meter per second), atmospheric stability class. In this case, the end point distance at 0.1 miles. No public receptors were identified over the most recent population census data. Also no known environmental receptors are located within this radio area.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program:\n\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility wich will improve significantly the safety "

List off all SOP's are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nPRASA has various SOP's to manage emergency programs associated to release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\n\n\n\nFive years Acction History:\n\nThis is recently constructed facility. There is no release history to be reported.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPRASA has already implemented in Las Marias Filtration Plant, a vacuum operated chlorination system to improve the control of the process and the safety of the facility. The Facility is equiped with a caustic scrubber to capture and treat any chlorine gas release from the storage and chlorination rooms. The Facility will undertake administrative actions handling and transportation, employee's training, emergency personal protective equipment, preventive maintenace and audits. Recommendations were given on that regard on last PHA dated February 2, 2012."
