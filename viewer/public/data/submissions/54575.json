The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and complies with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nAntonio Leal, Water Plant Superintendent, is the responsible official at the Edinburg Pump Station No. 1. The Pump Station No. 1 is located at 2100 West Sprague Street, Edinburg, Hildalgo County, Texas. A one-ton chlorine container with a tank mounted vacuum regulator is on continuous operation, while another one-ton chlorine container serves as a backup. The chlorine containers, situated outside, have manual shutoff valves in case of emergency, and a chlorine alarm triggers if a release occurs. Emergency air supply and power are available for emergencies. Plant operators check the facility every four hours. A self-contained-breathing-apparatus (SCBA) is stored in the West Tower, approximately 65? from the chlorine containers.\n\nThe offsite consequence analy"
