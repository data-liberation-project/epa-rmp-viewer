This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the City of Midland Fire Department and Midland LEPC which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nN&B Midland Site is a primarily chemical manufacturing, which also includes specialty products.\n\nThere are (2) covered processes, three (3) programs, and six (6) regulated substances present at N&B Midland Site.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substances are listed below:\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\nEthyl chloride\n\nEthyl Ether (diethyl ether)\n\nHydrogen Chloride\n\nMethyl chloride\n\nMethyl Ether\n\nPropylene oxide\n\n\n\nWorst and Alternative Case Scenario Selection:\n\nThere is one (2) toxic worst case and one (2) flammable worst case reported.  For the toxic worst-case scenario, the selection was based upon the furthest endpoint distance and the greatest impacted receptors.  For the flammable worst-case scenario, the selection was based upon the furthest endpoint distance and since there are no impacted receptors other variables were considered such as maximum capacities, location/distance to the fence line, and predominant wind direction. There are six (6) total alternate cases, two of which are flammable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nN&B Midland Site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention "

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nN&B Midland Site maintains detailed records of safety information that, among other things, describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design associated with all covered processes.  Numerous types of information are available to supplement safety information, including Safety Data Sheets for materials used on-site, equipment and engineering design specifications, and applicable reactive chemicals testing.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nN&B Midland Site conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  For initial screening and risk evaluation, calculations of The Dow Chemical Fire and Explosion and Chemical Exposure Indices are performed, and a Reactive Chemical and Process Hazard Analysis is conducted.  These methodologies are supplemented when needed with analyses that may include:  What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), Fault Tree Analysis and Safer Technology and Alternative Analysis (STAA).  A team of qualified personnel performs the studies along with experts in engineering and process operations.

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nN&B Midland Site has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nN&B Midland Site carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel receives specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at N&B Midland Site to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training on the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications of existing processes are conducted as a regular practice at N&B Midland Site.
