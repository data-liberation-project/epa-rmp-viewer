Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in some process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  In total, Calumet Shreveport has 11 program areas that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  These units are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at Calumet Shreveport.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios of both hydrofluoric acid and flammable substances caused by equipment failures or human errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Calumet Shreveport has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\n\tRelease Detection:  Hydrogen sulfide detectors, Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms, and personal Hydrogen sulfide detectors.\r\n\tRelease Containment/Control: Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate process materials to prevent overpressure damage to equipment, Manual and automatic valves     permit isolation of the processes; Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters, curbing or diking to contain liquid releases, Redundant equipment and instrumentation where needed.\r\n\tRelease mitigation systems: Fire suppression and extinguishing systems, deluge systems, trained emergency response personnel, personal protective equipment.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nCalumet has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Some examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of motorized vehicles, (2) a lockout/tagout/try procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-produci"

This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n  Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nCalumet Shreveport has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Calumet Shreveport Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study to perform these evaluations.  A HAZOP uses a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design.  Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Calumet Shreveport Refinery assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.  The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator may utilize outside contractors that lead PHAs when appropriate.\r\n\r\n   Operating"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and at least annually certified by the Area Unit Supervisor as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks\r\n\r\n   Training\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Calumet Shreveport has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New operational employees receive basic training and they are later paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least on a three-year cycle.  Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\n   Contractors\r\n\r\nCalumet"
