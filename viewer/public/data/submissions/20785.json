The steam is used for enhanced oil recoveryand a portion of the electrical power is consumed by Chevron, while all surplus power is sold to the local utility. A new aqueous ammonia process unit is being added to the existing Cogeneration Plant and is scheduled to start up in 2nd quarter 2000.  The ammonia will reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx)  in the flue gas, which is accomplished by injecting ammonia vapor in the flue gas just prior to exposure to a catalyst.  The resultant chemical reaction reduces the NOx to harmless nitrogen and water.   The aqueous ammonia that is used is a <30% concentration.  The maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia at the facility is above  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities,and  above the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) threshold quantity.  There are no other process units or substances at the Kern River Cogeneration Facility that are regulated under RMP or CalARP.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained plant  personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULT\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) at the Eastridge Cogeneration Plant is a release of the maximum quantity of 72,000 lbs of aqueous ammonia from the storage tank.   A written procedure is in place to limit the storage"

No other public receptors or manned facilities are within the endpoint.  The OCA (offsite consequence  analysis) is based on EPA's RMP*Comp program, version 1.06.  \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for aqueous ammonia is a leak from a \u00be\" hole in the piping system.  It is assumed that the leak continues for 20 minutes until the leak can be stopped.  The contents from this release would be fully contained in the diked area.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document. The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

The following types of safety features are used in the aqueous ammonia system:\n \nRelease Containment/Control:\n \n1. Tank  relief valves discharge away from personnel and equipment in the event of over-pressurizing of the storage tank.  \n \n2. Valves permit isolation of the process.\n \n3. High pressure alarm in the storage vessel.  \n \n4.  Containment wall sorrounds the storage tank and equipment to fully contain any potential spill or release.   Any collected material can be routed for decontamination and disposal.\n \n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n \n \nRelease Mitigation:\n \n1. Fire extinguishing system\n \n2. Trained emergency response personnel\n \n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, fire fighting turnouts)\n \n \n \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Eastridge  Cogeneration Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  Since the ammonia system is a new addition to the existing Cogeneration Plant, there are no accidents to report for the five-year accident history.  \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe  Eastridge Cogeneration Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local eme"

In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Chevron USA Production Kern River Cogeneration Plant processes or other third party facilities that may affect the operations at the plant. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the  Eastridge Cogeneration Plant is coordinated with the Bakersfield Fire Department. This coordination includes periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Chevron USA Production Kern River Cogeneration Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate Public Safety officials and/or emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to monthly safety meetings, the Chevron Kern River Cogeneration Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the plant operators. In addition, the plant operators are given annual refresher training for emergency response regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant. All  plant personnel have undergone hazardous material training and are classified under LEVEL 5  of the Hazwopper designation which covers the First Responder,and First Responder Operational.The supervisor of the facility has also been trained to a level 5 Response level, incident commander training. \n \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY"

      "SummaryText": "Planned changes to improve safety include but are not limited to the following. Prior to system star-up;a hazardous communications training event will be offered to all those plant  personnel involved with plant operations,including the operation of the aqueous ammonia system. this training event will cover hazards and precautions to be taken when working with ammonia. A procedure has been implemented for the loading and unloading of ammonia into storage which includes the use of a standby observer, safety watch, and the wearing of the proper PPE(personal Protective equipment) as well as the monitoring of the area for hazards and releases;and isloation of the area to non-essential personnelwhile aqueous ammonia is being off-loaded. A number of detectors have been installed in the storage and process area that will give early warning in case of an accidental release of ammonia vapors. All plant presonnel have been trained in emergency response and hazard assesment and will respond accordingly. Additional procedures are being implemented to secure the plant and insure that no unathorized entry is allowed without first reporting to the control room, and receiving a briefing on the proper response procedures while on plant premises. Where necessary plant procedures will be modified accordingly to insure compliance with Chemical accident prevention procedures."
