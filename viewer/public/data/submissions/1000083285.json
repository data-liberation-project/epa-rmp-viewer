      "SummaryText": "FAR Research, Inc. (FAR) is a manufacturer of pharmaceutical intermediates and fine organic chemicals. Bromine and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) are two of the chemicals used by FAR that are stored in sufficient quantity to require development and submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP). This summary describes FAR's activities and safeguards which have been instituted to protect employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\nFAR has operated at the Palm Bay, Florida facility since 1983. FAR synthesizes pharmaceutical intermediates and fine organic chemicals. These chemicals are sold to the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, electronics, and general chemical industries. Over the years, FAR's products have been used in compounds designed to fight Aids, Hepatitis B, and other diseases. Other FAR products have been used to facilitate the manufacture of electronic chips; others have been used by the space industry. One FAR product has improved the efficiency of the manufacture of nylon. FAR and its employees are committed to continue to safely manufacture organic compounds that make a positive difference.\n\n\n\nFAR consists of employees and the physical facility. The technical, operations, and support groups are committed to the safe development and manufacture of the products synthesized. The typical \"path\" for a new product at FAR begins with a customer need, followed by a thorough literature search for safety and process information. Upon completion of the background work, a synthesis route is proposed and the laboratory work commences. Chemists and technicians complete process development on a small, glassware scale to ensure that the synthesis can be completed safely. The next step includes the writing of a proposed, detailed procedure to be completed at the pilot scale. A process safety review meeting is then scheduled. The review participants include the process development chemist, the manufacturing manager, the technical director, the safety manager and the general manage"

      "SummaryText": "r. Other staff may be involved if warranted. The review includes verification that proper development procedures have been followed and that available safety and health information has been obtained, checked, and included with the batch record. Any recommended changes made by the committee must be completed prior to scale-up of the process. The review committee may also require that special operator training sessions be held prior to running certain compounds or chemistries. \n\n\n\nEquipment Summary: Process equipment at FAR is designed for the intended use. Process vessels are hastelloy, glassteel or grade 316 stainless steel. The vessels are ASME Code rated and are protected with rupture discs and/or relief valves. If corrosion is of concern, testing may be completed prior to running in a given vessel. Glassteel vessels may be spark tested to verify integrity. Alloy vessels are tested using ultrasonic wall thickness testing devices. Key vessels and equipment are checked for maintenance annually.  Both the TMCS and the bromine tanks are surrounded by a containment dike designed to hold more than the maximum volume of the tank.  In addition, the TMCS tank is protected with an AFFF 3% medium expansion foam deluge system.\n\n\n\nThe materials triggering filing of the RMP are bromine and TMCS. Liquefied bromine is stored in a 2,000-gallon storage tank and a 1,500-gallon receiving vessel/reactor. TMCS is stored in a 5,000-gallon pressure rated carbon steel tank. The maximum quantities of bromine and TMCS inventoried are 56,000 pounds and 35,000 pounds, respectively. FAR's policy is to minimize inventory of all raw materials. The materials are delivered by bulk tanker in quantities of approximately 30,000 pounds. Orders are not placed unless inventories are less than 15,000 pounds for bromine and 2,000 pounds for TMCS. Bromine inventory is verified by tank load cells, receiving and usage records.  TMCS inventory is verified by level gauge, receiving and usage records.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo a"
