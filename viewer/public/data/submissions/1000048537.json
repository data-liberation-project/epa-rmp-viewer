There are Program 3 elements the Kugler Company has not yet performed since the implemetation of a Program 3 Prevention program.  Since the RMP-Esubmit software permit does not allow blank dates, we have used \"11/11/11\" to mark those elements for future implementation.  Corrections will be filed when those respective tasks are performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n**End of notes**\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary, continued:\r\n\r\nCulbertson Production Plant\r\n\r\nThe Culbertson Plant is located in a rural setting on the edge of the corporate limits of Culbertson, Nebraska.  The facility converts and blends raw feed stocks to produce a variety of liquid products to be used as agricultural fertilizer in surrounding areas.  Kugler Oil Company, the parent of the Culbertson Plant is a family owned corporation located in McCook, Nebraska.  The owners live in McCook, surrounded by friends and neighbors who are also their customers.  The principal officers of the parent company as well as nearly all the employees at the Culbertson location are very active in the affairs of their local communities and are as interested in the health and welfare of their neighbors as they are of their own families.\r\n\r\nThe facility has three large pressure vessels for the storage of Anhydrous Ammonia. The various grades of fertilizers plus all the other chemicals used and stored at this facility are not considered hazardous or are stored below the threshold amounts to be considered under Part 68 of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nIn constructing this plan, many alternative scenarios were envisioned which could involve the accidental release of ammonia. The most probable of these unlikely scenarios might be the release of excess pressure due to natural solar heating of an overfilled storage tank. With the release of 100 pounds of liquid material over a ten minute period, the maximum predicted travel of the resulting vapor cloud would onl"

The safety director is also a member of the LEPC.  \r\n\r\nIn the unlikely scenario where an ammonia vapor cloud would leave the premises of the Culbertson Plant, our employees are trained to inform the local population. Coordination has been effected with the Hitchcock County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) whose agencies can provide for notification of those residents likely to be affected so that they may in turn evacuate the area. \r\n\r\nSince the time of its acquisition in the early sixties, there have been no reportable releases (greater than 100 pounds) from this facility.  The Company attributes this to the knowledge and experience of employees and supervisors to be key to this flawless record.  \r\n\r\nAccess to this plant is funneled through a single entrance which passes around the administrative building.  The storage tanks are in plain sight of employees at this facility and are visually monitored to prevent any unauthorized access to the equipment.  Kugler Oil company has met all SARA Title III and Tier Two and EPRCA 312 reporting requirements.\r\n\r\nKugler takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of Ammonia from our system. These precautions include safety controls (automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. Kugler also has a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia is th"
