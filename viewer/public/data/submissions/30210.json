The ERP will need to be completed by December 30,2004. A review of the EPA guidance for emergency response has been conducted and tentative changes in the response plan are pending a review of the PSM progam. A NC OSH representative visited this facility in December 03 and has required that an outside firm perform an update of the PSM Program. Morganton Public Safety constitutes 80-90% of the local haz mat team.     This allows response time to be minimal.  The hazmat team has trained on the use of the chlorine kit b and how to repair leaks. \n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled.\nThe Catawba River Water Filtration Plant is a conventional flocculation facility utilizing chlorine to disinfect the potable water.  Other chemicals used in the process to clean up water include aluminum sulfate, caustic soda, calgon, and a corrosion inhibitor. The facility capacity is 18 million gallons a day.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\nThere has been no change in the materials that were designed by the construction engineering firm of the 1992 upgrade.  Monthly and weekly chlorine hoist inspections, written programs and, procedures, protective equipment is stored near the chlorine feed area.  An equipment supplier has been employed to come in biannually and inspect the chlorinators to keep them in top operational and maintenance condition. \n\nThe five year accident history.\nThere have been no accidents at this facility in the last five years.\n\nThe emergency response program.\nThe emergency response program has been reviewed and due to the Bioterrorism Act a Vulnerability Assessment will be completed by June 30,2004 an"
