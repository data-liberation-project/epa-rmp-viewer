              "Description": "This is a batch process, in which all reactions are carried out in a stirred tank, batch reactor.  The regulated substance associated with this process is dimethylamine (DMA).  The largest amount is stored in a pressure vessel rated at 250 pounds per square inch gauge pressure (psi), far below the tank pressure rating.  The tank is protected from an overpressure that might rupture it by the rupture discs and safety relief valves installed on the tank.  As DMA is loaded into the storage tank, a closed loop piping system is employed to recycle the DMA vapors back to the delivery truck while the DMA liquid is being pumped into the storage tank.  The DMA storage tank is permanently grounded, and the delivery trailer is temporarily grounded during the unloading process to prevent static electricity buildup and sparking that could potentially cause combustion of a hydrocarbon.  The delivery truck driver and plant operator are present during the unloading process to make corrections required to ensure the safe unloading of DMA.  The truck driver and plant operator assigned have both been trained in the safe handling of DMA. The DMA storage tank is located in an approximately 60 ft. by 34 ft. by 45 in. high diked area.  A water deluge system is in place around the tank and can be remotely operated to suppress any excess emissions that might result from any tank, piping, or equipment leak within the containment dike.  The pumps used to transfer the DMA from the storage tank to the batch are also located in the containment area.  An excess flow valve is installed in the line from the tank to the delivery pump that will activate and shutdown the flow of DMA in case of a line rupture or any excessive DMA flow from the storage tank.  A check valve is also installed in the reactor delivery line to prevent contamination of the DMA in the storage tank.  The reactor is a water jacketed, stirred tank, pressure vessel.  The water jacket is used to control the reactor temperature, which helps control the reaction and reactor pressure.  The reactor mixer shaft contains a double mechanical seal to prevent leakage of gases and liquids from the reactor.  The reactor is also protected from overpressurization by rupture discs and safety relief valves.  The reactor is vented to the plant scrubber system to control emissions that might occur during the reactor filling cycle.  A safety shower and emergency eye wash are located in the immediate reactor area and in the truck delivery area.  The operators and supervisors are trained to prevent any unsafe operation of the complete process.  The personnel and supervisors are also trained to implement emergency response procedures in case of an emergency.  Routine maintenance procedures are implemented and documented.  A mechanical inspection of the process and safety equipment was conducted initially and is conducted annually to ensure mechanical integrity and correct any deficiencies that might be discovered.",

              "Description": "The hydrogenation process is a batch process where basic chemical are reacted in a pressurized, stirred tank reactor to produce a product.  The regulated substances for this process are ammonia, hydrogen, acrylonitrile, and formaldehyde.  The largest quantity of each regulated substance onsite is in its respective storage tank.  The batch reactor is protected from a potential catastrophic rupture caused by overpressurization using safety relief devices.  The reactor is vented to the plant scrubber system when it is being loaded or depressurized to prevent excess emissions to the atmosphere.  Nitrogen is used to purge the reactor of oxygen to prevent a flammable mixture that could potentially ignite.  A safety shower, eyewash, and protective equipment are located near the reactor.  The acrylonitrile storage tank is a 250 psig rated pressure vessel.  Nitrogen is used as a blanket in the tank to prevent oxygen from coming in contact with the acrylonitrile vapors.  Without oxygen, the acrylonitrile vapors can not be ignited.  The tank pressure is also controlled by the nitrogen to 125 psig, well below the pressure rating of the tank.  Safety relief devices vent to the atmosphere to protect the tank from catastrophic rutpure by an unlikely overpressurization.  The piping and tank were inspected prior to being placed in service and are inspected on an annual basis.  A remotely controlled water deluge system is constructed around the storage tank.  The storage tank is also located in a diked area that is large enough to contain the contents of the tank and deluge water, should such a situation occur.  A closed loop vapor recycle system is used to fill the tank.  The ammonia storage tank is also a 250 psig rated pressure vessel with relief devices installed to prevent a catastrophic rupture of the tank.  An excess flow valve is installed between the tank and piping.  Should a pipe line rupture or ammonia is fed too fast to the reactor, the excess flow valve will shut automatically within one second to prevent a major release of ammonia to the atmosphere.  A closed loop vapor recycle system is also used for delivery of ammonia to the storage tank.  The hydrogen storage tank is a refrigerated vessel kept at -427 degrees F.  Hydrogen pressure at this temperature is 14.7 psig.  This tank also has safety relief devices to prevent catastrophic rupture of the tank.  The tank is also insulated to assist in the control of the hydrogen temperature.  Should the refrigeration system malfunction, the release of hydrogen from the safety relief device (along with the tank insulation) will keep the hydrogen in the tank cold enough so that only small quantities of hydrogen are released at one time.  All plant operators, supervisors, and truck drivers are trained to handle their respective chemicals in a safe manner and are prepared to handle emergency situations that might arise.  A formal maintenance reporting and action plan is in place to correct leaks or equipment malfunctions in a timely manner that might occur.",

              "Description": "The Quat process is a batch process operation using a stirred tank, pressure reactor with a double mechanical sealed mixer shaft.  The reactor is protected from catastrophic rupture caused by overpressures by safety relief devices.  Nitrogen is used to purge the reactor of oxygen prior to filling.  The reactor pressure and temperature, like all of the other batch reactors onsite, are controlled during the reaction by a reactor cooling water jacket and by the controlled addition of the reactive chemicals.  The reactor is vented to its own quench system that is consist of a pressure vessel containing the relatively inert liquid mixture of amine bottoms and isopropyl alcohol that willbe charged to the reactor for the next batch reaction.  This quench vessel is closed to the atmosphere and any vented reactive chemicals from the reactor will react completely with the contents of the vessel.  The listed chemical for this process are methyl chloride and trimethylamine.  Methyl chloride is stored in a 250 psig pressure rated vessel that is equipped with pressure relief devices to prevent a catastrophic rupture of the tank.  The ambient pressure of methyl chloride does not exceed 75 psig, which is well below the pressure rating of the vessel.  The tank is located within a diked area and is surrounded by a remotely controlled deluge system.   A firewater monitor is also located outside the diked area to help cool down the tank and control methyl chloride emissions, if required.  The tank is loaded from a tank delivery truck using a closed loop vapor recycle system as described in the other processes to minimize emissions to the atmosphere.  The delivery truck contents are verified with the storage tank contents by plant operators to ensure that the delivered chemicals are loaded into the proper storage tank.  The truck delivery hoses and connections are checked by the truck driver and plant operator for potential leaks.  Prior to coupling, the truck brakes are set, and the wheels are chocked to prevent movement.  The truck is grounded to prevent static electricity buildup and discharge.  The plant operator and truck driver remain with the truck during the unloading procedures.  Trimethylamine is stored in a 30,000 gallon tank rated at 250 psig.  Transfer from the rail car is conducted using compressor and vapor return lines.  The tank is located in a diked area.  It is equipped with remote shut-off valves, high level interlocks, and high temperature/pressure interlocks with the pump.  The tank is equipped with flammable gas detectors/alarms and flow detector, which when activated, automatically shut down the system.  A video camera is installed to monitor the area.  The pressure rating of the railroad tank car is 350 psig, and the tank car is approved by the DOT for safe transportation of trimethylamine.  The pressure relief device on the car is set at 280 psig to prevent a catastrophic rupture of the tank.  An excess flow valve is installed on the railroad tank car to shut down the flow of trimethylamine should a major leak develop in the trimethylamine piping or should the feed rate to the storage tank be too high.  When the railcar is spotted, the wheels are set and chocked.  The car is grounded and a derail block is placed at the head of the tracks.  Like the delivery trucks, the hoses and connectors are inspected for leaks.  Protective gear is used by plant personnel during this procedure.  A safety shower and eyewash is located in this area.  Self contained breathing units are readily available.  Plant operators and chemical truck drivers are trained and experienced in the safe handling of their respective chemicals and area trained to handle potential emergency situations.  The storage vessels, reactors and piping are inspected and tested before being placed in service and are inspected for mechanical integrity on an annual basis thereafter.  Like the rest of the processes reported, the formal maintenance program is applicable to this process.",
