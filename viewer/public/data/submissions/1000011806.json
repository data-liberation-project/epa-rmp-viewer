Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Corsicana Technologies, Inc., Corsicana Plant, has always had a strong commitment to its employees to provide a safe working environment. This policy is consistent with both the spirit and the intent of our commitment.  The safety of employees, company operations, and the public are management's most important complete compliance with all safety regulations and safety policies.\n\nEvery attempt will be made to reduce the possibility of accident occurrence by all levels of management.  Corsicana believes that safety, like quality and housekeeping, can be controlled by motivated supervision.  Therefore, preventable lost time accidents will have an impact on a supervisor's annual salary review, including any bonuses and incentive plans.  Unreported accidents will be considered falsification of company records and will result in immediate discharge.  Lost time accident free locations will be eligible for annual awards.\n\n2.  The Station Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nCorsicana operates a specialty chemical plant and manufactures fatty amines and nitrile intermediates.  The principal products are emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, de-emulsifiers, and surfactants.\n\nWe have eight regulated substances present at our facility as raw materials for processes, which include dimethylamine (DMA), acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen, formaldehyde, methyl chloride (MeCl), epichlorohydrin, and trimethylamine (TMA).  Acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde, epichlorohydrin, and methyl chloride are regulated as toxic chemicals and trimethylamine, hydrogen, and dimethylamine are regulated as flammable chemicals.\n\n \n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out "

      "SummaryText": "under 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) Processes Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCorsicana maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of the information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. Corsicana primarily uses the checklist and HAZOP method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals.
