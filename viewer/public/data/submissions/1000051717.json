The quantity of cans stored in our warehouse puts us over the 10,000 lbs propane/n-butane threshold.  The worst-case scenario is based on a single can exploding.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  The facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
