This system contains ammonia in the amount over the threshold requiring an RMP. \n\n\n\nC\n\nWorst - Case Scenario\n\nThe worst - case scenario was determined by finding the largest vessel containing the most ammonia. This vessel is also located outdoors. This vessel is the ammonia receiver located on the south side of the plant. According to the Plant Engineer , this vessel could contain as much as 10000 lbs. of ammonia, which is the maximum capacity of the receiver. This amount is used as the quantity Q since for the worst - case scenario, the vessel is assumed to be full. The time of release is 10 minutes. The rate of release, R, is calculated as 10000 lbs / 10 minutes = 1000 lbs. / minute. \n\n\n\nQ = 10000 lbs. ammonia\n\nT = 10 minutes\n\nR = 1000 lbs.

This radius and the surrounding area are drawn on the city map of Omaha. Using information from the Census Bureau, the population enclosed by a radius of 1.2 miles from the source is 850.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario was chosen by contemplating scenarios involving off - site consequences. A broken 1/2 \" pipe located on the roof was chosen as the source of the release. This scenario involves a release of 640 pounds / minute over a 10 minute period. The toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles was obtained. The population within this radius is 170.    \n\n\n\nD\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Policies include the following: \n\n1.

Main consideration and planning for disaster control must include provisions for protecting personnel, evacuation both injured and uninjured and care of the incapacitated.  While certain basic elements would be common to all plans, the same complete plan could not, for example, be used for both an ammonia line break and a tornado.\n\n\n\nEach location m"
