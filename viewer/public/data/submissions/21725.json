This Executive Summary is provided to demonstrate Kimberly-Clark's continuing commitment to run an operation in Everett that is safe both to its employees and the surrounding community.\n\n\nElimination of Elemental Chlorine from the Bleaching Operation and Startup of a New Chlorine Dioxide Bleach Plant  \n\nThis revised RMP is submitted because Kimberly-Clark is discontinuing use of elemental chlorine at the mill and is starting up a new chlorine dioxide bleaching system, which uses dilute aqueous chlorine dioxide solution.  The chlorine dioxide is subject to EPA's RMP program.  This re-submitted RMP describes the prevention program used for the new chlorine dioxide system, and adds information on the modeling of hypothetical accidental releases of chlorine dioxide.    \n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Kimberly-Clark (K-C) Everett mill consists of a 500 air dried metric ton ammonium based sulfite pulp mill, a bleach plant, two pulp drying machines, and five paper machines.  The pulp mill was built in the 1930s and was owned by the Soundview Pulp Company until the early 1950s, when it was purchased by Scott Paper Company.  Scott Paper added paper machines and owned the operation until it merged with Kimberly-Clark Corporation in 1995.\n\nIn the sulfite pulping operation, softwood and hardwood chips are cooked in batch digesters utilizing ammonium bisulfite cooking acid prepared on site.  The cooking separates the pulp fibers from the binding material (lignin) which holds them together.  To prepare the cooking acid, sulfur dioxide gas (SO2) is mixed with an aqueous solution of ammonia (NH3).\n\nThe sulfur dioxide is primarily generated by burning elementa"

      "SummaryText": "l sulfur, but is also reclaimed from the recovery boiler flue gas.  Alternatively, it is obtained by the purchase of pressurized SO2 gas.  This purchased \"liquid SO2\" is brought in by truck and stored in two 100-ton tanks located inside the pulp digester building.  This quantity of SO2 is above the 5,000 pound threshold for the Risk Management Program; consequently, it is subject to the RMP regulations.  \n\nThe ammonia is brought to the site in anhydrous form via 80 ton rail cars.  This quantity exceeds the 10,000 pound RMP threshold for anhydrous ammonia; consequently, it is subject to the RMP regulations.  The ammonia is pumped from the rail cars and diluted with water prior to storage in a 150,000 gallon tank.  The aqueous ammonia is stored at approximately 20% strength; this quantity stored exceeds the 20,000 pound RMP threshold for aqueous ammonia, so aqueous ammonia is also subject to the RMP regulations.  The ammonia solution is employed on site not only to prepare the cooking acid, but also for pollution control: it is used as a reactant in the sulfite recovery boiler to remove nitrogen oxides from air emissions, and it is used in the mill's secondary wastewater treatment plant to provide the nutrients needed for proper operation.  It is also used to buffer concentrated spent sulfite liquor prior to storage. \n\nPulp leaving the digesters is transported to three counter-current pressure washers; weak spent sulfite liquor from the washers is transported to multiple effect evaporators where it is concentrated.  The concentrated sulfite liquor is then burned in the sulfite recovery boiler to generate steam.  \n\nAfter washing, the sulfite pulp is bleached.  The original bleaching system, described in the plan submitted to EPA in June 1999, utilized three bleaching stages: chlorination, caustic extraction with oxygen, and hypochlorite.  The new bleaching system also has three stages: chlorine dioxide, caustic extraction with oxygen and peroxide, and chlorine dioxide."

      "SummaryText": "  \n\nUnlike chlorine, which was transported to the site by barge and/or rail car and historically stored in a 720 ton tank, the chlorine dioxide solution will be manufactured at the mill via the Solvay process.  In this process, sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, and methanol are mixed in a primary reactor through which air is bubbled.  The methanol reacts with the sodium chlorate in this acidic environment to produce gaseous chlorine dioxide (ClO2).  The primary reactor underflows to a smaller secondary reactor where additional methanol and bubbled air are added to drive the reaction to its conclusion.  The chlorine dioxide gas is collected in the vapor space of the reactor vessel and transferred to an absorption tower.  In this tower chilled water is introduced to absorb the chlorine dioxide, forming a solution containing 8 to 14 grams per liter (approximately 1% ClO2).  The chlorine dioxide solution is then transferred to storage tanks prior to use in the bleaching process.  Two 50,000 gallon tanks of 1% chlorine dioxide solution have been constructed.  Each tank will contain up to 5,000 pounds of chlorine dioxide.  As this quantity exceeds the 1,000 pound RMP reporting threshold, chlorine dioxide is subject to the RMP rule.\n\n\nTiming\n\nThe chlorine dioxide generator will start-up in late July 2000.  From late July through September, the chlorine dioxide will be introduced into the first bleaching stage along with elemental chlorine to test out the generator and the effect of ClO2 on the bleaching process and pulp quality.  Hypochlorite bleach liquor will still be used in the third bleaching stage.  In early October 2000 the mill will be shut down for a ten day conversion period.  After this shutdown, chlorine will no longer be used at the site, and bleaching will be as described above utilizing chlorine dioxide, caustic extraction, and chlorine dioxide bleaching stages.\n\nThis RMP Plan is written to describe the process as it will be constituted in October 2000 and the"

Equations from EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\" were used to estimate the release rate.  Based on EPA guidance it was assumed that the building would partially contain the gaseous release, so of the 100 tons released inside the building only 34 tons would be lost to the outside air in the first 10 minutes.

It is estimated that the plume would travel 8.8 miles before it dispersed to EPA's toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm.  \n\nAlternate Release Scenario: Sulfur Dioxide\n\nKimberly-Clark's safety review team selected the following hypothetical accident as the Alternate Release Scenario: a large earthquake breaks a 420-foot long pipe connecting the SO2 storage tanks to the processing plant.  The entire contents of the pipe (590 pounds of anhydrous liquid) spills onto the ground, forms a liquid pool that immediately cools to its boiling point temperature (-14 degrees F), and forms a puddle of SO2 \"ice\".

Elimination of Elemental Chlorine Bleaching.  Kimberly-Clark is installing a new chlorine dioxide bleach plant, replacing the elemental chlorine bleaching system.  This will eliminate the import, storage, and use of compressed liquid chlorine at the mill.  The dilute aqueous chlorine dioxide solution will be essentially used as it is generated, keeping the quantity stored low and greatly reducing risks to the surrounding community.  \n \n? Improved Traffic Barriers.  Kimberly-Clark evaluated potential traffic accidents that could damage piping containing aqueous ammonia solution, and installed new traffic barriers at some locations.  After installation of the barriers, there is no realistic likelihood of a traffic accident causing damage to process piping at the ammonia system.  \n \n? Enclosure of Liquid Sulfur Dioxide Tanks.  The two liquid SO2 tanks are located inside the pulp digester building.  Historically the end of the building containing the tanks was open to the atmosphere.  Large building doors were refurbished and are now kept shut thus enclosing the tanks, which reduces significantly the distance any release would travel. \n \n? Community Cooperation.

This information will no longer be relevant after October 2000.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nAnhydrous liquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature) is imported to the site by 90 tons rail car.  The Administrative Worst-Case Release Scenario assumes that the entire 90 tons of chlorine in a car are emitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of exceptionally calm winds and stagnant atmospheric conditions (1.5 meter/second wind speed and \"F stability\") that would result in minimal dispersion of the gas cloud as it blew downwind.   \n\n    A speaker at a technical conference from a southern mill recently put the worst case release scenario into perspective.  He calculated that a discharge of the entire contents of a 90 ton chlorine rail car in 10 minutes would require blasting a 3 foot diameter hole into the car.  Since the car is stationary when on the plant site, it is difficult to conceive what sort of force short of an asteroid collision could cause such a cavity.   EPA's scenario contemplating full evaporation in 10 minutes is equally extraordinary.  The thermodynamic properties of anhydrous chlorine indicate that such a large instantaneous gas release is not possible.  If the 90 tons of liquid chlorine was somehow discharged from the tank or car it would spill onto the ground and immediately cool itself until it formed a puddle of ice, which would take much longer than 10 minutes to evaporate into a gas cloud.  To evaporate the chlorine in 10 minutes would require a heat source equivalent to a small boiler, but no such heat source is present in the vicinity of the chlorine storage area.  Finally, this imaginary heat source would create convection currents, increasing the height of the plume.  But EPA's modeling directive assumes the gas cloud remains at ground level.
