      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy at Pawtucket Power is to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  It is our goal to achieve and sustain \" Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our procedure to notify the Pawtucket FIre Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nPawtucket Power is a combined cycle cogeneration power plant.  The regulated substances handled here are Anhydrous Ammonia used as a refrigerant to enhance gas turbine performance and efficiency and Aqueous Ammonia used as a catalyst to control nitrogen oxides (NOx).  Approximately 13,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia is used in the \"Chiller System\" and 12,000 gallons of Aqueous Ammonia is stored in an above ground storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a catastrophic failure of the Cooler System.  This facility is located in an urban area and there will be off-site consequences in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at Pawtucket Power are to comply with EPA's accidental prevention rule, OSHA's process safety management rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  Each system and equipment at Pawtucket Power is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the afformentioned codes, laws, and regulations.\n\nPawtucket Power has had no accidents associated with ammonia use during the life of the facility, through June 18, 1999.\n\nThe emergency response program at Pawtucket Power is to contact the Pawtucket Fire Department.  It is our policy to request the fire department's response to an emergency and to inspect our facility yearly to ensure they are familar with our systems and materials.\n\nThere are currently no planned changes to improve safety at Pawtucket Power."
