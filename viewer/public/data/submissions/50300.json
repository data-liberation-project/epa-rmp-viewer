KNC?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nKNC?s Enid Nitrogen Plant produces anhydrous ammonia, urea fertilizer, and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  Anhydrous ammonia is also injected into the main pipeline to be transported to distribution terminals.    \n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of two ammonia units, a urea production unit, and a UAN unit.  Ancillary units include a carbon dioxide pipeline compressor station, an argon separation plant, and an ammonium polyphosphate portable unit that is at the plant for approximately one week twice per year.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with carbon dioxide to produce solid urea fertilizer in the urea production unit.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.   \n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) a"

An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane, ethane, and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n \n\nHydrochloric acid, nitric acid, argon, nitric oxide, ammonium polyphosphate, urea ammonium nitrate, and urea-formaldehyde are stored at the facility.  These substances are not subject to RMP reporting for reasons discussed below.  Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid are stored in concentrations lower than the minimum necessary to be considered an RMP substance (40 CFR 68.130 Table 1).  Hydrochloric acid is subject to the RMP rule if it is stored in concentrations of 37% or greater.  Nitric acid must be at a concentration of 80% or greater to be subject to the rule.  The Enid Nitrogen Plant stores these substances at concentrations no greater than 20% and 56%, respectively.  Argon is stored at the facility; however, it is not a listed RMP substance.  Nitric Oxide is found in the process but in amounts less than threshold quantity.  Urea ammonium nitrate and ammonium polyphosphate are mixtures that do not contain RMP-regulated chemicals in concentrations greater than 1%, making these products exempt according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1).  Formaldehyde solutions are subject to RMP reporting.  However; urea-formaldehyde (CAS # 9011-05-6), which is stored at the facility, is not considered ?a formaldehyde solution but a complex polymer molecule? according to the Frequently Asked Questions (Question II.36) on EPA?s website.  Although these substances are not subject to RMP reporting, the Enid Nitrogen Plant handles them in a safe manner.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facil"

These high standards include:\n\n?Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n?Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n?Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n?Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Enid Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Minimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\n?Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\n?Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\n?Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n?Minimizing the possibility of a release of ammonia by having emergency shutdown buttons at the loading areas.\n?Reducing the severity of fires and providing a means to control vapor cloud formation with fire monitors located throughout the facility.\n?Reducing the risk of overfilling by having level alarms and/or indicators on storage tanks and bullets.\n?Implementing procedures for loading/unlo"

This incident occurred June 4, 2007 and resulted in one onsite injury for which the employee required medical treatment.  The release of ammonia occurred while employees were attempting to open a valve on the ammonia transfer heater (303-C).  After failed attempts to open the valve, plant personnel put a steam hose on the ball valve to try and free the valve when the valve?s gasket failed and ammonia was released to the atmosphere.  Plant personnel minimized emissions to the maximum extent practicable by blocking in 303-C and connecting it to the plant?s flare system so that the majority of the ammonia could be safely routed to the plant?s flare.  When the ammonia was released it sprayed onto one employee?s arm and side.  He was taken to the hospital for treatment of first and second degree burns. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Enid Nitrogen Plant with the Enid Fire Department, the Garfield County Sheriff, and the Garfield County LEPC.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Oklahoma State Police, and Oklahoma Gas and Electric and St. Mary?s Regional Medical Center.  The Enid Nitrogen Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectiv"
