This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer Silica Gel Plant located in Lincoln County, Wyoming is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing LLC and is operated by Enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer Silica Gel Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of two separate gas processing plants, designated as Plant 1 and Plant 2. The two plants are designed to utilize a solid bed adsorption or \"quick cycle\" process to recover primarily pentane and heavier natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.  Smaller amounts of methane, ethane, propane and butanes are also recovered in the process, but the plant includes liquid stabilization equipment to remove the lighter components from the produced liquids and re-inject them in the outlet gas stream   The primary purpose of the facility is to control the hydrocarbon dew point of the residue gas.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids.  Residual gas is removed by pipeline systems and finished products are removed by truck.\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer Silica Gel Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded"

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\n\n\n\nListed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Pioneer Silica Gel Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and pentane.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 1 site under the EPA RMP program. \n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  The limited amount of flammable liquids results in a very small worst case scenario distance, and RMP Program Level 1 registration.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Pioneer Silica Gel Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required only by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\n\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing "

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\n\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documen"

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Pioneer Silica Gel Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer Silica Gel Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer Silica Gel Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer Silica Gel Plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
