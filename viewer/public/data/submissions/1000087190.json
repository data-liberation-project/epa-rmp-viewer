This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  The objective of risk management and our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, EIF Channelview personnel at site will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.  Additional emergency response resources are available from LyondellBasell (adjacent facility) should the need arise as EIF Channelview has an agreement with LyondellBasell for providing emergency services support. \r\n\r\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Channelview Cogeneration Facility is located in Houston, Texas in an industrial setting entirely within the property boundary of the Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex (LyondellBasell).  The facility is an electric cogeneration station consisting of four 170-MW, combined-cycle, natural gas-fired turbines coupled to a single steam turbine for electricity generation and steam production.  A Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) equipped with duct burners with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system are associated with each of the gas turbines.  The SCR systems employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is around 29% solution of ammon"

      "SummaryText": "ia in water.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia storage and handling system at Channelview Cogeneration Facility is comprised of two storage tanks, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the evaporator for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The tanks have a capacity of 30,000 gallons each but are not filled more than 95% of volume. The tanks are equipped with pressure relief valves, as well as temperature, pressure, and level indicators. Ammonia detectors are located on each tank and on the ammonia transfer pump skid.\r\n\r\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP. \r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was conducted in May 2016 and prepared in support of this RMP utilizing the methodologies recommended by EPA and fully incorporated in the RMP*Comp, Version 2.01 modeling system.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario (WCS) considered the catastrophic rupture of one of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks, in which the entire content of one tank is released within the secondary containment dike.  The secondary containment dike is large enough to contain the entire volume and limits the exposed surface area of a pool, which reduces the release rate. Under worst-case meteorological conditions of 1.5 m/s wind speed and atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), the resulting ammonia cloud could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.  This worst-case impact distance extends outside of the Channelview Cogeneration Facility but remains within the outer property boundary of the Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex.  The ammonia concentrations exceeding the RMP toxic endpoint threshold would not extend beyond the property boundaries of the Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex.  The WCS endpoint distance does not reach any offsite residences, institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals), parks, or recreational areas.\r\n\r\nSeveral alternat"

      "SummaryText": "ive release scenarios (ARSs) were considered including releases due to a failed delivery hose, a failed pipe between the ammonia transfer pumps and an ammonia flow control unit (AFCU), a failed pipe between an AFCU and an evaporator, and a corrosion-caused hole in piping.  The release due to a failed delivery hose resulted in the farthest impact distance (0.1 miles) and this ARS is included in the RMP submitted to the U.S. EPA.  The impact due to the ARS extends outside of the Channelview Cogeneration Facility but remains within the outer property boundary of the Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex.  The ammonia concentrations exceeding the RMP toxic endpoint threshold would not extend beyond the property boundaries of the Equistar Chemical Channelview Complex.  The ARS endpoint distance does not reach any offsite residences, institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals), parks, or recreational areas.\r\n\r\nThere are two water monitors (water curtain systems) located near the aqueous ammonia storage tanks, which could serve as active mitigation to knock down an ammonia plume in the event of a release.  The effect of this mitigation measure was not included in the ARS analyses as a conservative approach, since the water monitors would be manually activated.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere has been one underground pipe leak that occurred in April 2019 due to suspected pipe corrosion.  An attempt was made to excavate the underground pipe to find/repair the leak, but the area of the leak was underneath existing structural foundation.  A new pipe was routed aboveground and was placed in service in July 2019.  To eliminate the potential of future underground pipe leaks, new piping for the remaining units were routed aboveground and placed in service in April 2020.  This release is not reportable under the RMP rule and is therefore not presented in Section 6 of this plan.  \r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM ELEMENTS\r\n\r\nChannelview Cogeneration Facility am"
