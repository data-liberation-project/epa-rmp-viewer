      "SummaryText": "Packerland Whey Products, Inc. produces a high protein, high energy feed intended for beef and dairy cattle.  Lacto-Whey competes with soybean meal as a protein source.  Lacto-Whey has been fed to beef and dairy cattle since 1979 with excellent results.  The fermentation process includes converting anhydrous ammonia to aqua ammonia through an ammonia converter, which is used in the process.  Our anhydrous ammonia tank is of conventional design, state inspected and state approved.  This tank includes all the safety features typically used for anhydrous ammonia storage.  It is routinely inspected by the state.  The tank has internal, excess flow shut off valves to stop the flow of ammonia in the event of a hose failure or accident which could release ammonia from an attached line.  We have experienced no failures of the tank or lines since start-up in 1979.  Our employees are trained on the job to be careful with ammonia through our Process Safety Management program."
