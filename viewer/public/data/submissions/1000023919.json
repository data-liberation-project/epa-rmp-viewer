These procedures identify potential sources of release and the necessary corrections to equipment to prevent these releases.  The equipment is reviewed by onsite personnel and certified refrigeration contractors, as required. Licensed refrigeration engineers are utilized to review new and modified systems prior to startup.\nInitial emergency response is provided by onsite personnel.  Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release.\nNo emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other onsite personnel. \nLocal fire and police departments with mutual aide response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Emergency contact information is included in Section V.\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n2.\tDescription of Source and Substance Handled\nThe Cambria Winery facility, located at 5475 Chardonnay Lane in Santa Maria, California, uses anhydrous ammonia in their winemaking operations in two separate systems. In the refrigeration system, ammonia is used to cool glycol, which is pumped through fan coils; it is also used to control the temperature of the wine in jacketed stainless steel wine tanks. The operating charge for the refrigeration system is 12,790 lbs.\nThe other much smaller system is an ammonia storage tank used for pH control in their process wastewater system. The ammonia tank used in the wastewater treatme"

This Risk Management Plan covers the ammonia used in refrigeration, although the same process safety is in place for the smaller system.\nAmmonia Refrigeration\nThe barrel storage room temperature is controlled with fan coils that are cooled with chilled glycol. The glycol is chilled in a plate and frame heat exchanger. The cooled glycol is then pumped to the barrel building fan coils. \nThe winemaking process is controlled with the use of ammonia-filled jackets that surround the wine tanks. These jackets consist of channels capable of circulating cooled ammonia in a continuous flow, enabling the juice and wine to be kept at a controlled temperature. \nThis refrigeration system consists of the following equipment\n\u00c2\u00bf\tFour compressors\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA low pressure receiver\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA high pressure receiver\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA fixed evaporative cooling condenser\n\u00c2\u00bf\tBarrel storage room evaporators with glycol only\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAutomatic controls for the barrel storage room and individual systems. \n\u00c2\u00bf\tTwo glycol chillers\n\u00c2\u00bf\tJacketed wine tanks\n\u00c2\u00bf\tWine chillers\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix A, describe equipment details. A complete set of system drawings is included in a separate printed Risk Managment Plan binder.\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may cause suffocation, as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, and serious skin burn.\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\nCambria Winery is required to maintain an accidental release prevention program for the purpose of eliminating or minimizing releases"

The program must include equipment monitoring, regular inspections and maintenance, and log keeping of (1) operating conditions, (2) scheduled maintenance, (3) emergency response, and (4) operator training. \nThe ammonia refrigeration-operation system has equipment specific safety measures in place to prevent accidental release. Operators and mechanics must have required training for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They must also be trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. \nCambria Winery is required to conduct annual safety training and equipment operation training. Training topics should include (1) equipment operational procedures, (2) emergency response procedures, (3) review of general Risk Management Plan procedures, (4) review of Business Response Plan procedures, and (5) evacuation procedures.\nRefrigeration equipment will be inspected and reviewed periodically and as new equipment becomes operational onsite, as required. This RMP, which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system, is maintained onsite. A thorough review of this system, including a \"What If\" hazard analysis, was performed in accordance with update requirements. \n4.\tEmergency Response Program\nThe facility has implemented the federal and state mandated emergency response plan (Business Response Plan). This plan outlines procedures for emergency ammonia release response as well as general facility response.\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The safety coordinator is responsible for contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\n5.\tFive-Year Accident Histo"
