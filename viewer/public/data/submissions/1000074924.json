This program includes all the Elements of the PSM/RMP regulations with emphasis on procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without releases.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event.  HAZMAT and other emergency contacts would be notified immediately.  The Nashville Fire Department has been included in the notification and action plan.  Chairmans Foods personnel are trained to assist the responders with information only, and would not participate in an actual response if it required Level A suits.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases or reportable incidents at this facility in the last 5 years or since the ammonia refrigeration system was installed."

S. #7664041-7.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility.  The ammonia refrigeration system contains approximately 17,400 pounds of ammonia in a closed looped system.  The facility exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is expected to last a lifetime.  Releases are prevented by a combination of engineering, administrative controls and mechanical integrity of the equipment and pipe system.  The was designed by a professional engineering firm and installed by an experience ammonia refrigeration contractor.  Engineering controls include automated component shutdowns in the unlikely event that safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation, emergency shutdown E-Stops and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nComputer air models were developed based on a worst-case release scenario involving a catastrophic structural failure of the system high pressure receiver.  The high pressure receiver could potentially contain the largest quantity of ammonia in a single vessel at this facility.  EPA has defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance (anhydrous ammonia for our facility) from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the grea"
