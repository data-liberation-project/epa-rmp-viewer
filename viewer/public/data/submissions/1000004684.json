      "SummaryText": "The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Joseph Jensen Water Treatment Plant (Jensen Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWDSC has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\n\nJensen Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken"

As discussed in the Executive Summary of the June 2004 RMP submission under ??A?Planned Changes to Improve Safety,??A? MWDSC decided to modify the Jensen Plant Chlorination Facility with a chlorine containment and scrubbing system to capture and neutralize an accidental chlorine release.  The decision to install the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility, which is equipped with two chlorine vapor scrubbing systems was made to further enhance safety and mitigate offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  The Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility is now completed and the modified Chlorine System contained in that facility is in operation.\n\nThe information required in the RMP Executive Summary is provided below for the newly modified Chlorine System at the Jensen Plant.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MWDSC accidental release prevention policy for chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response.

The plant is situated south of the Golden State Freeway (I-15) and Antelope Valley Free (14) junction.  The facility was constructed in 1972 and covers 232 acres.  The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the Federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nThe Chlorine System at the Jensen Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to convert the chlorine to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment systems for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\n\nThe chlorine storage vessels are totally contained in the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility storage bays.\n\nThe process flow for the Chlorine System begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping system.  Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own vapor pressure from an on-line storage vessel"

The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection purposes.\n\nThe Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility is continuously monitored in the control room by video cameras and chlorine leak detectors. Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator??A?s console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eyewash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility including the scrubber system.\n\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accide"

In the event power is lost at the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility, an alarm will alert the control room.  The water treatment plant has an emergency generator system, which provides backup power to run the plant, including the Chlorine System and scrubber units, in the event of a power failure.\n\nThe control room at the plant is manned 24 hours a day, year round.  Access to the plant is through guarded security gates, which are closed after regular hours when the plant is patrolled by security guards.

The Jensen Plant accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n- Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n- Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\n- Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\n- Performance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n- Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n-"
