The RMP established three levels of requirements \r\nfor the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the \r\nenvironment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed \r\nfor \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most\r\nstringent of the three levels.\r\n\r\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\r\n\r\n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\r\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\r\n       North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\r\n       Five-year accident history\r\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \r\n\r\nThis facility is regulated under Program 2 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\r\n\r\n       It stores acrylonitrile in excess of the threshold quantity\r\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public Receptor\r\n       (residence)\r\n       It does not operate under a NAICS code specified in the rule\r\n       It is not subject to OSHA PSM because PSM does not apply to flammable \r\n       liquids stored in atmospheric tanks which are kept below their normal \r\n       boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration \r\n       [29 CFR 1926.64(a)(1)(ii)(B)].).\r\n\r\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has\r\nmore than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under\r\n40 CFR 68.115.

Process safety \r\nand emergency response materials are kept on site and periodically reviewed.  Information\r\nincludes information pertaining to the hazards of TDI and chloroform, process technology, \r\nprocess equipment, and emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nThe stationary source is the Stolthaven New Orleans acrylonitrile storage tank and related \r\nappurtenances.  The largest acrylonitrile process group (e.g., largest storage tank or \r\ngroup of interconnected tanks) has a storage capacity of 2,100,000 gallons (14,160,000 \r\npounds).  The total acrylonitrile stationary storage capacity is 14,160,000 pounds, which \r\nis stored in a single tank.\r\n\r\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per hazardous substance\r\nhandled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program applicability.  Stolthaven has chosen to use \r\nDEGADIS+ to determine offsite impacts because acrylonitrile vapors are heavier than air.\r\n\r\nFor this facility, a worst-case release would occur in the event that the largest \r\n(2,100,000-gallon) storage tank would rupture and the entire contents would be released to \r\nthe atmosphere through evaporation.  This spill was modeled as continuous release because \r\nit would require more than 60 minutes to evaporate the contents of the tank.  In the case \r\nof acrylonitrile, the evaporation would take more than 186 hours.  The worst-case scenario \r\nrequires a ground-level release height (0 feet).\r\n\r\nThe DEGADIS+ release model results indicate a worst-case impact of 2.82 miles for the \r\nfacility.  The worst-case model output summary is included in Appendix A.  The rule defines\r\nthe toxic endpoint of acrylonitrile to be 0.076 mg/L.

While this scenario is still unlikely because the operators \r\nare present during transfer operations, it is more likely than the worst-case as required \r\nby 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).
