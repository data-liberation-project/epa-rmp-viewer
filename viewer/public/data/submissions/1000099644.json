We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs \n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases \n\n  from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n* The certification that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n* The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n\n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nOur facility produces three PSM/RMP covered processes, Ammonium Thiosulfate production, Oleum production and Sulfur Dioxide production, using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  In our process, we produce or consume the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\nOleum - 968,400 lbs. storage, used as a finished product and in the manufacture of sulfur dioxide\n\nSulfur Dioxide - 1,614,000 lbs. storage, used as a finished product\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia- 625,440 lbs. storage, used as a raw material to manufacture ammonium thiosulfate\n\n \n\nOur accidental release prevention pr"

Our management systems address each of the key features of sucessful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n* Process safety information\n\n* Process hazard analysis\n\n* Operating procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical integrity\n\n* Management of change\n\n* Pre-startup safety review\n\n* Compliance audits\n\n* Incident investigation\n\n* Employee participation\n\n* Hot work permits\n\n* Contractors \n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\n* Operators trained and tested in operating procedures for all chemical processes\n\n* Process controls to monitor and maintain chemical processes within specific parameters\n\n* Mitigation systems to mimimize potential releases\n\n* Monitoring systems including television cameras to alert personnel to potential releases and gas detection sensors\n\n\n\nThese elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n  \n\n4.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. PVS Chemical Solutions had one chemical release of sulfur dioxide on 28 June 2021, due to a dead flange on a drain nozzle not being re-torqued after initial installation.\n\nThe leak occurred on the SO2 make tank developed at the dead flanged drain nozzle on the south side of the tank.

However, maintenance staff failed to re-check the the torque on the blind flange after the unit was in operation.  Training was conducted on proper torque technique for this equipment and work orders are generated for re-checking torque after line breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWe maintain a comprehensive contingency plan which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n6.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n\n\n* Continuous improvement program to evaluate chemical safety and release prevention systems.\n\n \n\n"
