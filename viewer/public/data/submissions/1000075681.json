Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: \n\n\n\nChanges are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Incident Investigation: The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. Compliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable RMP / PSM / SIP procedures and regulations.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\n\n\nNo reportable release of a regulated substance has occurred in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for the Plant is coordinated with The McPherson County\n\nEmergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the LEPC. The Plant conducts period"
