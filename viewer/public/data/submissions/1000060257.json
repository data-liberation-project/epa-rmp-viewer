The RMP rule establishes standard worst case weather conditions and requires each source to consider these conditions when modeling its worst-case releases.  In addition to being worst case, these standard conditions assure that all sources evaluate their scenarios under the same conditions.  Facilities may use weather conditions that are appropriate for their location in their alternate scenarios.  We chose to use the average conditions as based on the closest National Weather Service station (i.e., Paducah, KY) for all alternate scenarios. (Footnote 3)  The worst case and the average conditions follow:\r\n\r\nParameter\r\nWorst Case Wind Speed - 1.50 m/sec\r\nAverage Wind Speed - 3.11 m/sec\r\nWind Direction - 180 degrees\r\nWorst Case Humidity - 50%\r\nAverage Case Humidity - 70%\r\nStability Class - F (very stable - night)\r\nAverage Stability Class - D (neutral - day or night\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbon Disulfide (CS2) Scenarios\r\n\r\nCS2 is toxic and flammable and has a high vapor pressure.

Accordingly, our goal is to experience zero injuries, accidents and incidents.  In order to meet this goal, we will commit any necessary resource and we empower each employee to use those resources.  One such resource is our extensive suite of safety procedures.  The core of these procedures is a combination of relevant regulations, industry standards, good engineering practices and best management practices.\r\n\r\nGeneral Information\r\n\r\nVanderbilt Chemicals, LLC, - Murray Division (Vanderbilt) is a specialty manufacturer of organic and organo-metallic lubricant additives, rubber accelerators, antioxidants, and paint additives.  Many of our primary products belong to the dithiocarbamate family.  Some of the products are powders or pellets; others are mineral oil based concentrates or aqueous mixtures or slurries.  Co-products include aqueous solutions of sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) and sodium sulfate (NaSO4).\r\n\r\nThe primary liquid reactants include amines (primary, secondary and tertiary), carbon disulfide, methylene chloride, mineral oil, hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, alcohol complexes of dithiophosphoric acid, isopropyl and other alcohols.  We store these materials in aboveground storage tanks (AST's), tank trucks, tank cars, totes and drums.  The majority of the AST's are located in Tank Farms in the eastern portion of the site.  We receive dry solid reactants in bulk super sacks, fiber drums and paper sacks and store them primarily in the A72 Warehouse.  These materials include, but are not limited to, metal oxides (e.g., of antimony, molybdenum and zinc), oxidizers (e.g., hydrogen peroxide), and various minor processing aids and additives.  Some of these materials are toxic; some are flammable; and some exhibit both toxic and flammable characteristics."

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program (Footnote 1)\r\n\r\nThe risk management rule1 (RMP) applies to certain stationary sources that have more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance present in their process.  The list of regulated substance includes 77 toxic and 63 flammable substances.  Vanderbilt's Murray, KY facility is one of these sources.  The RMP rule describes three categories of sources and establishes different requirements for each category.  The rule considers whether the source:\r\n1. has had an accidental release of a regulated substance with off-site consequences within the last five years,\r\n2. could have an accidental release of a regulated substance that could cause off-site consequences,\r\n3. falls into a specific type of industry and\r\n4. is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management rule(Footnote 2) (PSM).\r\nVanderbilt handles one regulated (toxic) substance in greater than threshold amount and otherwise meets conditions 2, 3 and 4, therefore it is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Vanderbilt's Murray facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance that resulted in off-site consequences within the last five years.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires each affected stationary source to report its 5-year accident history and to determine the off-site consequences of a worst case release for each regulated substance that it handles above the threshold amount.  For releases of regulated toxic substances, the rule defines worst case as a release whose toxic endpoint reaches the greatest distance from the point of the release under standard weather conditions that do little to dissipate the vapor cloud.  The RMP rule defines a unique toxic end point for each regulated substance.  Worst case occurs when the substance is spilled and the resulting pool has the largest possible surface area.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the worst-case scenario, the rule requires each affected facility to include at least one"

      "SummaryText": "e note this AST was put into service in October 2016.  The two underwater storage tanks are being taken out of service and decommissioned in 4Q2016 and 2017.  From here, we pump to a 2,050 gallon above ground day tank and then pump at low rates to vessels in the various process trains.  Specialty pumps are used to move the CS2 from the receiving vessels into the AST.  Specialty pumps are also used to transfer from the storage tank to day tank, and day tank into process vessels.  These specialty pumps are designed to minimize leaks of CS2.  Both AST's have double wall construction, located under a structural roof, with a foam deluge sprinkler system due to CS2 flammable properties.  Both AST's are positioned on a sloping concrete floor which flows to a containment pit containing water.  Water helps ensure that any accidental release of CS2 from a tank will settle below the water thus suppressing vapors.  The AST's also utilize a vapor balancing system between receiving vessels, bulk storage tank, and day storage tank.  This minimizes air emissions as required by our operating permit issued by the Division for Air Quality of the Kentucky Environmental Protection Cabinet.  In addition to this safeguard, Vanderbilt takes other precautions when handling and storing CS2:\r\n\r\n1. rail cars and isotainers must not have bottom valves;\r\n3. all unloading is over-the-top via dip tube;\r\n4. all unloading connections are bolted (no quick-coupled hose connections);\r\n5. special unloading and handling instructions and training.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case accident under the RMP rule is a spill of the entire contents of a tank car into the area around the railcar at worst case weather conditions.  Such an accident would spill 10,000 gallons (105,000 pounds) of CS2 into an unlined stormwater ditch.  The resulting evaporating pool would have a surface area of about 4,245 square feet (i.e., 394.4 m2).  In this scenario, the toxic end point occurs 0.78 miles from the center of the release (see be"

Otherwise, in the event of a release of any amount of any chemical anywhere, anytime (including an odor complaint), the Foreman will immediately notify the Duty Supervisor of the incident and then he will attend to the release with the resources available.  The Duty Supervisor must then immediately notify the Environmental Manager or Safety Manager followed by others staff members as needed.  The Environmental Manager must evaluate the incident and, if required, make all necessary agency notifications.  This procedure is documented in the facility's Integrated Contingency Plan.\r\n\r\nEach incident report must be distributed to the staff by the next normal business day.  Each report is discussed during the semi-weekly staff meeting.  At this time, a suitable corrective action is determined and responsibility for implementing that corrective action is assigned.  After the corrective action is complete, each report must be closed in writing.  The Safety and Health Manager alone is authorized to close incidents that involve injury, illness, fire or explosion.  The Environmental Manager, or his designate, is authorized to close any incident that involves a release, including odor complaints.

Such assessments include thickness measurements on storage tanks and the structural components of tanks and buildings.  The results of all assessments conducted on in-service equipment in recent year's leads us to believe that our tanks and structures are sound and fit for their present duty.
