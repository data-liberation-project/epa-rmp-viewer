Included are descriptions of the facility accident prevention and safety program, emergency preparedness and response program, regulated chemicals, five-year accidental release history, alternative release scenarios, and the worst case scenarios.  The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community awareness, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or alternative release scenario would ever occur.  These potential scenarios are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency and are used to illustrate the importance for risk communication, risk reduction, safety, prevention, and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nCommissioned in 1983, Valero's Corpus Christi refinery produces high-quality, premium products from low-value feed stocks.  This highly specialized facility produces an exceptionally high yield of gasoline and gasoline blendstocks and is one of the few refineries in the country that can produce 100 percent of its gasoline as reformulated gasoline (RFG).  In addition, it is one of the few refineries outside of the state of California that produces and sells the CARB Phase II gasoline.  Both RFG and CARB gasolines have fewer toxics and lower emissions than conventional gasoline.  Clean fuels produced at Valero are marketed in the Northeastern United States, Texas, and California in areas where the Environmental Protection Agency has mandated their use.  Low-sulfur diesel fuel and some petrochemical feedstocks are also produced.  Several industry experts have rated this 195,000 barrel-per-day facility as one of the most complex, high conversion fuels facilities in the United States.\n\nThe Valero refin"

Also, Valero has spent $40 million on pollution control equipment over the last 8 years.  For these activities and demonstrated commitment to the environment, Valero received the 1995 CLEAN TEXAS 2000 Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence.  In addition, Valero consistently receives annual safety awards from the National Refiners Association.\n\nLocated at 5900 Up River Road, Valero covers approximately 253 acres and has over 4700 feet of frontage on the Corpus Christi Ship Channel.  The site employs almost 500 full time employees with an annual payroll around $25 million.  In addition, between 50 to 100 contractor employees are in the plant on a daily basis assisting with maintenance and small construction projects.  Annually, Valero has local material and service purchases of approximately $40 million.\n\nValero is very proud of its employees' involvement in the community.  One hundred percent of Valero's employees contribute to the United Way of the Coastal Bend.  The Valero Volunteer Council is involved in many community projects during the year including Adopt-a-School, mentoring, Junior Achievement, and Operation Paintbrush.  Over 30 volunteer projects are accomplished annually all making our community a better place in which to live.\n\nFor more information call\nVALERO REFINING COMPANY - TEXAS\n512-289-6000\nPrepared in association with the Nueces County Community Team\nAccident Prevention and Safety Programs\n\nDesigning for Safety:\n\n- Process equipment is designed and constructed by technically skilled personnel for safe operation.\n\n- Emergency relief systems are in place to prevent uncontrolled releases to the environment.\n\n- A water spray system is designed to shower the Alky unit area and \"knock down\" vapor clouds.

Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride is normally stored under pressure as a clear, colorless liquid.  At ambient conditions, HF readily vaporizes to a gas when fuming from an open pool or venting from a pressurized container and may produce a visible white cloud of condensate.\n\nHydrogen Fluoride is used to produce a high-octane gasoline blending component.  It is also used to produce aluminum, fluorocarbons refrigerants, blowing agents, pharmaceuticals, in stainless steel pickling, welding, fertilizer production, fluoride production, and to etch glass and pottery.\n\nHF is a pungent, poisonous gas with an irritating odor at low concentrations.

Inhalation of HF is extremely serious, requiring immediate medical attention.\n\nDescription of the Alternative Release for Hydrogen Fluoride\n\nApprox. 2,800 lbs of Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) is released to the environment from the failure of a \u00be\" line on a process storage vessel.  Within five minutes, of the start of the release, automatic water spray controls approx. 90% of the vapor release and foam spray over HF pools controls evaporation.  Shut-off valves are triggered closing off the flow from the vessel.  Within fifteen minutes, the vapor release is stopped by emergency response actions.  The circle represents a level of concern of 0.79 miles from the point of release.\n\nFive-Year Accidental Release History for Hydrogen Fluoride\n\nValero Refining Company - Texas, Corpus Christi, has an excellent operating history in which there were no Hydrogen fluoride releases resulting in on-site or off-site damages during the previous five-years.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: Chlorine\n\nChlorine is a greenish-yellow gas handled under pressure.  It has a pungent sharp odor.  It is used to purify water, to bleach paper, wood pulp, and textiles, and is a building block for making a wide variety of other chemicals and products.  Chlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant.  In sufficient concentration, the gas irritates the mucous membrane, the respiratory tract, and the eyes.  In extreme cases difficulty in breathing may increase to the point where death can occur from respiratory collapse or lung failure.\n \nFive-Year Accident Release History for Chlorine\nValero Refining Company - Texas, Corpus Christi, has an excellent operating history in which there were no chlorine releases resulting in on-site or off-site damages during the previous five-years.\n\nDescription of the Alternative Release for Chlorine\n\n210 lbs chlorine vapor is released from the failure"

The distance to the level of concern for chlorine is 0.39 miles from point of release.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: Hydrogen Sulfide\n\nHydrogen sulfide is a colorless, toxic flammable gas that is denser than air.  It is generated when hydrogen is used to remove sulfur from crude oil and petroleum products such as diesel fuel.  It also occurs naturally in hydrocarbons such as natural gas and in the gases from volcanoes, sewers, and swamps.  It is converted into sulfur, inorganic sulfides, and sulfuric acid, which in turn are used to produce a variety of useful products such as fertilizer, paints, explosives, batteries, paper, detergents, dyes, plastics, rubber, leather, and medicines.  Low concentrations produce a \"rotten egg\" odor while higher concentrations paralyze the sense of smell.  Breathing of hydrogen sulfide is serious, requiring prompt medical attention.  Brief exposure to high levels may cause dizziness, drowsiness, tremors, and even death.  Lower levels can produce headaches, dizziness, and bronchitis.\n  \nFive-Year Accident Release History for Hydrogen Sulfide\nValero Refining Company - Texas, Corpus Christi, has an excellent operating history in which there were no hydrogen sulfide releases resulting in on-site or off-site damages during the previous five-years.\nAlternative Release History for Hydrogen Sulfide\n\nApproximately 2,900 lbs of hydrogen sulfide mixed with other organic chemicals are released from a 1-inch hole in piping to a high-pressure separator before the line is blocked off.
