Process Hazard Analysis: \nCPPC performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. CPPC encourages team members with knowledge and experience working with hazardous chemicals to participate in the PHA task team effort. The PHA findings are shared with employees working with hazardous chemicals. Employees are advised of any necessary changes brought about by the PHA and, in some cases, may be involved in the design change and implementation process. \n\n?    Operating Procedures: \nCPPC process engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safety performed. Employees participate in operating procedure development in several ways: \n1.    Employees are consulted during procedure development and implementation to determine if the procedures accurately reflect what is practiced in the field and what additional measures should be added to increase worker safety and protect the environment.\n2.    Development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are assigned to employees that have recognized knowledge, experience and job skills related to the assigned procedure. \n3.    Implementation of new processes or procedures is assigned to a commissioning team. These assignments typically include an opportunity for a critique of the work processes and procedures. \n\n?    Training: \nCPPC trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. Employees are trained through self-taught learning materials including operations manuals, educational modules and computer based education programs. In addition, employe"

Employees are encouraged to identify education needs and take part in education development and implementation. Skills are demonstrated through written exams, oral exams, and through proficiency demonstrations.\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity \nCPPC maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. Employees record equipment history, data and observations, maintain the SAP maintenance system database, and generate Reliability Maintenance system reports. The employee doing the actual test and inspection work is typically asked to review and comment about manufacturers recommendations for preventive maintenance procedures and test frequencies. Employees take part in equipment failure reviews, participate in work process critiques, and are encouraged to make recommendations for change. \n\n?    Management of change: \nThe CPPC management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind are approved without completing the full management of change process. Changes other than ?like kind? must be approved through the management of change process to ensure that potential accidents resulting from change are prevented, safety concerns of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.  \n\n?    Pre-startup Review: \nCPPC performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely. The PSSR ensures that drawings have been updated, training is complete, procedures are written and the necessary documentation is made before the modifica"

Team members are encouraged to ask safety questions, do individual prestartup safety reviews, and discuss any concerns identified. \n\n?    Compliance Audits: \nIn addition to regular safety and environmental compliance audits, CPPC conducts Process Safety Management (PSM)/RMP compliance audits against the provisions of OSHA?s PSM and EPA?s RMP requirements. In these audits, adherence to both Corporate and mill policies, internal procedures and standards are made. Team members will be interviewed as part of audit protocols to permit them to give input on the specific issues being audited. Audit reports, response plans and status updates will be shared with affected employees. \n\n?    Incident Investigation: \nCPPC investigates all incidents that could have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented. Team members are involved in incident investigation since their knowledge and skills in operations or maintenance are necessary to conduct the investigation. Once investigation team reports become available, the results and recommendations of the team are made available to those working in the process or operation. Communication is in the form of a report, which is circulated among employees and is discussed in scheduled safety meetings and in ad hoc meetings with team members. \n\n?    Employee Participation : \nCPPC developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of CPPC workers are addressed.

Hot Work Permits (Safe Work Practices): \nCPPC established a hot work permit program to control activities which may result in fires or explosions in covered processes. Team members, with appropriate job skills and experience, participate in the review of safe work practice procedures through their involvement with safety subteams, site-central safety core team or ad-hoc task teams.  A cross section of knowledgeable team members may be called upon to draft procedures and revisions to procedures. During the development or changes to critical activity procedures, emphasis is placed on involving a core functional team that will be affected by the procedure. \n\n?    Contractors: \nCPPC established a program to ensure that contractor activities at the CPPC facility are performed in a safe manner. Team members at CPPC have an integral role in the interface with contractors working at the site. They often work side-by-side with contract employees and have a high level of knowledge about how the contractor's work can affect or be affected by the process or adjacent processes. Each site team member and contract employee is encouraged to ask questions and to raise concerns about unsafe work activities or conditions. Site team members are expected to inform contract employers of the potential hazards of fire, explosion or toxic releases when repairing equipment so that contractors can work on it safely. Contractors are given a PSM Safety Orientation to the hazards of the process, how to protect themselves from those hazards and what to do in the event they do get exposed. After the Safety Orientation they must pass a written exam to document their understanding of the material presented.\n\n?

Trade Secrets: \nNumerous examples are given in the preceding sections of the Employee Participation Plan where team members have access to information developed to meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule. It is the intent of site management to disclose to team members and contract employees as necessary (subject to 29 CFR 1910.1200(i) trade secret protection constraints where applicable) the process safety related information needed to have an informed workforce whose efforts and attention to detail will ensure the CPPC continues to be a safe workplace. \n\n5 Year Accident History\nIn the past 5 years, there was one injury as a result of chlorine dioxide exposure. On April 25, 2003 during a planned maintenance outage, a contractor conducting work on the 3rd floor of the chlorine dioxide generator building, began breaking flange bolts on a 6-inch chlorine dioxide fiberglass pipeline. As is standard practice for chlorine dioxide planned maintenance outages, the piping had been thoroughly flushed with process water prior to beginning the scheduled maintenance work. As the contractor loosened the bolts around 11:00 AM, some residual chlorine dioxide gas trapped in the line was released. The contractor immediately retightened the bolts to stop the leakage and evacuated the area. \n\nThe contractor believed his exposure was low and waited until 2:45 PM to contact his supervisor and report a ?rattling in his chest?. The contractor was taken to the mill nurse and given first aid pr"

Corrective action included reviewing the lockout/tagout and line and flange breaking procedures to ensure they were well understood. The Contractor PSM Safety Orientation material was edited to inform contractors of the potential risk of residual chlorine dioxide gas when conducting line breaking and to follow the site line and flange breaking procedures.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAn Emergency Response Team capable of providing multiple emergency response functions is available on the plantsite. The team has regular Haz-Mat, fire fighting, and confined space/high angle rescue training and drills. In addition, the team is trained in CPR, patient packaging and handling and bloodborne pathogens. \n\nIn emergencies, the shift manager is the incident commander who determines the degree of hazard and risk posed to public health and the environment. An internal alert millwide alarm system can be sounded to summon the emergency response team. Procedures for regulatory, emergency management agency, and public notification are documented in the Quality System. Mutual aid requests are made through 911 notification. \n\nContinuous Improvement\nContinuous improvement in our safety and environmental programs is the expectation at CPPC.

CPPC encourages team members with knowledge and experience working with hazardous chemicals to participate in the PHA task team effort. The PHA findings are shared with employees working with hazardous chemicals. Employees are advised of any necessary changes brought about by the PHA and, in some cases, may be involved in the design change and implementation process. \n\n\n\n* Operating Procedures: \n\nCPPC process engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safety performed. Employees participate in operating procedure development in several ways: \n\n1. Employees are consulted during procedure development and implementation to determine if the procedures accurately reflect what is practiced in the field and what additional measures should be added to increase worker safety and protect the environment.\n\n2. Development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are assigned to employees that have recognized knowledge, experience and job skills related to the assigned procedure. \n\n3. Implementation of new processes or procedures is assigned to a commissioning team. These assignments typically include an opportunity for a critique of the work processes and procedures. \n\n\n\n* Training: \n\nCPPC trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.

In addition, employees are trained one-on-one through on-the-job training in the field. Employees are encouraged to identify education needs and take part in education development and implementation. Skills are demonstrated through written exams, oral exams, and through proficiency demonstrations.\n\n\n\n* Mechanical Integrity \n\nCPPC maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. Employees record equipment history, data and observations, maintain the SAP maintenance system database, and generate Reliability Maintenance system reports. The employee doing the actual test and inspection work is typically asked to review and comment about manufacturers recommendations for preventive maintenance procedures and test frequencies. Employees take part in equipment failure reviews, participate in work process critiques, and are encouraged to make recommendations for change. \n\n\n\n* Management of change: \n\nThe CPPC management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind are approved without completing the full management of change process. Changes other than ?like kind? must be approved through the management of change process to ensure that potential accidents resulting from change are prevented, safety concerns of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.  \n\n\n\n* Pre-startup Review: \n\nCPPC performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.

Team members with appropriate knowledge and skills are employed in the pre-startup review process at CPPC. Team members are encouraged to ask safety questions, do individual prestartup safety reviews, and discuss any concerns identified. \n\n\n\n* Compliance Audits: \n\nIn addition to regular safety and environmental compliance audits, CPPC conducts Process Safety Management (PSM)/RMP compliance audits against the provisions of OSHA?s PSM and EPA?s RMP requirements. In these audits, adherence to both Corporate and mill policies, internal procedures and standards are made. Team members will be interviewed as part of audit protocols to permit them to give input on the specific issues being audited. Audit reports, response plans and status updates will be shared with affected employees. \n\n\n\n* Incident Investigation: \n\nCPPC investigates all incidents that could have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented. Team members are involved in incident investigation since their knowledge and skills in operations or maintenance are necessary to conduct the investigation. Once investigation team reports become available, the results and recommendations of the team are made available to those working in the process or operation. Communication is in the form of a report, which is circulated among employees and is discussed in scheduled safety meetings and in ad hoc meetings with team members. \n\n\n\n* Employee Participation : \n\nCPPC developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of CPPC workers are addressed. Team members participate in compiling process safety and maintenance information with field checks to verify the accuracy of P&IDs, loop sketches, and equipment drawings used in normal work"

Team members, with appropriate job skills and experience, participate in the review of safe work practice procedures through their involvement with safety subteams, site-central safety core team or ad-hoc task teams.  A cross section of knowledgeable team members may be called upon to draft procedures and revisions to procedures. During the development or changes to critical activity procedures, emphasis is placed on involving a core functional team that will be affected by the procedure. \n\n\n\n* Contractors: \n\nCPPC established a program to ensure that contractor activities at the CPPC facility are performed in a safe manner. Team members at CPPC have an integral role in the interface with contractors working at the site. They often work side-by-side with contract employees and have a high level of knowledge about how the contractor's work can affect or be affected by the process or adjacent processes. Each site team member and contract employee is encouraged to ask questions and to raise concerns about unsafe work activities or conditions. Site team members are expected to inform contract employers of the potential hazards of fire, explosion or toxic releases when repairing equipment so that contractors can work on it safely. Contractors are given a PSM Safety Orientation to the hazards of the process, how to protect themselves from those hazards and what to do in the event they do get exposed. After the Safety Orientation they must pass a written exam to document their understanding of the material presented.\n\n\n\n* Emergency Planning and Response: \n\nCPPC has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accide"

Employees and participants in both safety incidents and drills conduct critiques to get comments and observations, identify learnings, identify opportunities for performance improvement and improve both emergency response planning and responder performance. Communication to both team members and contractors takes place on both formal and informal levels to that there is a complete understanding of the actions one should take in an emergency situation. \n\n\n\n* Trade Secrets: \n\nNumerous examples are given in the preceding sections of the Employee Participation Plan where team members have access to information developed to meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule. It is the intent of site management to disclose to team members and contract employees as necessary (subject to 29 CFR 1910.1200(i) trade secret protection constraints where applicable) the process safety related information needed to have an informed workforce whose efforts and attention to detail will ensure the CPPC continues to be a safe workplace. \n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nIn the past 5 years, there was one injury as a result of chlorine dioxide exposure. On April 25, 2003 during a planned maintenance outage, a contractor conducting work on the 3rd floor of the chlorine dioxide generator building, began breaking flange bolts on a 6-inch chlorine dioxide fiberglass pipeline. As is standard practice for chlorine dioxide planned maintenance outages, the piping had been thoroughly flushed with process water prior to beginning the scheduled maintenance work. As the contractor loosened the bolts around 11:00 AM, some residual chlorine dioxide gas trapped in the line was released. The contractor immediately retightened the bolts to stop the leakage and evacuated the area. \n\n\n\nThe contractor believed his exposure was"

The contractor was taken to the mill nurse and given first aid prior to being transported to the local hospital where he was seen by a physician, prescribed medication and released for return to work.  \n\n\n\nAn incident investigation was begun on this incident the day it occurred. Root cause cited in the report was the contractor failed to follow line and flange breaking procedures and failure to follow the JSA. Corrective action included reviewing the lockout/tagout and line and flange breaking procedures to ensure they were well understood. The Contractor PSM Safety Orientation material was edited to inform contractors of the potential risk of residual chlorine dioxide gas when conducting line breaking and to follow the site line and flange breaking procedures.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency Response Team capable of providing multiple emergency response functions is available on the plantsite. The team has regular Haz-Mat, fire fighting, and confined space/high angle rescue training and drills. In addition, the team is trained in CPR, patient packaging and handling and bloodborne pathogens. \n\n\n\nIn emergencies, the shift manager is the incident commander who determines the degree of hazard and risk posed to public health and the environment. An internal alert millwide alarm system can be sounded to summon the emergency response team. Procedures for regulatory, emergency management agency, and public notification are documented in the Quality System. Mutual aid requests are made through 911 notification. \n\n\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\nContinuous improvement in our safety and environmental programs is the expectation at CPPC. Near miss and safety incident investigations, root cause analysis and corrective action implementation support continuous improvement.
