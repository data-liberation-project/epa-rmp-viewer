      "SummaryText": "UniSea Dutch Harbor has a policy and programs in place so that there is no accidental release of chemicals.  Being a food processing facility, UniSea has gone far and above requirements so that even a small release is dealt with quickly, before any contaimination of our product can occur.  The two chemicals handled most often at our Dutch Harbor facility and with most concern is Ammonia and Chlorine.  We belive that both the worst case and alternative sceneriors attach are highly unlikly, given the procedures that are in place and the way the processes are laid out.  We have detectors set in key areas, with detetction limits at very low levels, computer or process logic controllers (PLC's) which are constantly monitoring the environment, along with trained response personell and resposne equipment.  We work closely with the local Department of Public Safety, State OSHA, Coast Guard and Federal OSHA, in program developmentent and response capabilties.  We have been under PSM since its adoptiona and have performed Process Hazards Analysis (PHA's) for both Ammonia and Chlorine with Chlorine not being required at this facility.  UniSea Dutch Harbor has not had a signifivcat relase of either chemical in the last Five (5) years, and we plan to continue that record.  Our emergency response program involves several groups of employees in Dutch Harbor.  From our Power House to our Security group, both of which operate 24 hours a day.  Emergency response plans are at both locations along with several others.  They are excersized on a regular basis, either through drills or actual responses or requests from outside sources.  At this time our only plans to imprrove safety within these processes is the increase in response equipment."
