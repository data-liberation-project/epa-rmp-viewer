It then delivers the treated water through a 26-mile pipeline to wholesale water customers in Johnson County. The City of Granbury, Texas, and Acton Municipal Utilities District (AMUD) have their own pipelines and pump stations.\n\nSWATS facility uses a lime softening process, disinfection, clarification and filtration purification stages to treat the raw surface water. It also uses an ultra-filtration membrane system and a reverse osmosis system to remove excess salt from the lake water and render the water potable. Only chlorine is used for disinfecting the raw surface water and is stored above the allowable threshold quantity. Presently, the Electrodialysis Reversal (EDR) system is out of service.\n\nSWATS received EPA Region VI's Regional Administrator's Environmental Excellence Awards for 1993 and 1996; the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's Outstanding Performance Award for 1992-1996; and was voted The Best Tasting Water in 1996.\n\nCHLORINE\n\nThe chlorine is stored on the north side of the chemical building in eight one-ton cylinders, where it is used in groups of two. One group is used and the other is held as backup- When the first group is exhausted the backup group is engaged by an automatic switchover module.\n\nThree separate chlorine feeders are in the Chlorine Feed Room in the Chemical Building. The first feeder is dedicated to primary disinfection of the raw water as it enters the plant. Here, we mix raw chlorine with sodium chlorite to form chlorine dioxide. The second to the secondary feed disinfection of the finish water system. Here, we combine raw chlorine with anhydrous ammonia in the finished water to form chloramines. The third feed system provides supplemental disi"

Here, raw chlorine is combines with liquid ammonium sulfate (LAS) to form chloramines in the settled water to UF and conventional filters. The three interconnected systems allow the substitution of any one of the feeders for the other, but principally it allows standby of the secondary disinfection of the finish water and the supplemental disinfection of the transmission system\n \n\nChlorine is conveyed by vacuum through the chlorine feeders to the injectors where solution water is added. The chlorine feed rates to each point of application are set proportional to flow rates measured by the raw water meter, blend and product water meter, and high service meter. The injector mixes the chlorine with water to pass the chlorine to other areas. The injectors send the chlorine and water solution into the finish water storage tank.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAuthority policies include the need for a written emergency action plan, exercises and reviews of the plan, emergency response training for facility personnel, and coordination with local responders.  In addition, monthly safety inspections are conducted by the Authority's Safety Training Officer.  Risk management consultants from our insurance company are used as resources.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPlant personnel are trained to handle chemical containers in such a manner as to prevent leaks or spills while connecting or disconnecting containers. Personnel are also trained to shut down the system by closing the cylinder valve in the event of an emergency or anticipated emergency.\n\n \nAll SWATS personnel receive awareness training to recognize and properly respond to accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Plant supervisors employ management by walking around techniques to periodically observe the employees under actual operating conditions to ensure they follow proper procedur"

      "SummaryText": "es. Safety training is conducted throughout the year and safety inspections by outside agencies are conducted semi-annually. In addition, various state and local agencies conduct inspections of the facility. \nThe chlorine process has two alarm systems. One alarm is a leak detector inside the Chlorinator Room where the chemical is dispensed to the required locations within the process. The second alarm is a chlorine switchover alarm located with the chlorine tanks. This alarm indicates empty tanks.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere were no reportable accidental releases of regulated chemicals in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSWATS staff has the capability to respond to and mitigate the release of on-site hazardous chemicals that present a moderate health and/or safety threat to SWATS and responding personnel, present a moderate potential for adverse environmental impact, are of limited size, and have low fire/explosion potential. If the spill/release is beyond the capability of onsite personnel, the City of Granbury and Hood County HAZMAT teams will respond by calling 911. Training and exercises are conducted periodically, especially since 9-11. The city, county and state have been conducting regional WMD-terrorist exercises, which included response to hazardous chemical releases as well as command and control functions. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWe anticipate continued joint training with local first responders and conducting additional internal HAZMAT and chemical safety training for operators, maintenance, and administrative personnel. Security enhancements and procedures have been made since 9-11 and continuous improvements are made as resources become available."
