      "SummaryText": "Facility Description and Regulated Substances handled\n\nThe Oneida Extraction Plant facility, located in Clay County Kentucky , is a Natural Gas Dewpoint Control plant designed to process 14 MMscf of Natural Gas per day . The compression was brought on-line in January 16, 2001.  The process was brought on line May 2001. The facility is manned 10 hours daily. \n\nLow pressure inlet gas (currently approximately 9.5 MMscfd) enters the facility from two CNR gathering systems.  The high side, Leslie County #1 & #2, is delivered to the plant via an 8\u00bf pipeline at approximately 75 psig. The low side, Clay County #1 & #2, is delivered to the plant via an 8\u00bf pipeline at approximately 7 psig.  The gas is compressed by two identical Natural Gas Engine drive reciprocating gas compressors to process pressure of approximately 350 psig.  The gas is dehydrated using Tri-ethylene Glycol (TEG) prior to entering the propane refrigeration stripper portion of the process.  \n\nOverhead vapors (residue gas) from the stripper portion of the process with a volume of 8.5 MMscfd is delivered through two (2) outlets to the Columbia Gas Transmission Pipeline (KA1) and the Somerset Manchester 8\u00bf.  Liquids leaving the stripper portion of the process flow to the storage area of the facility. \n\t\nThe facility produces approximately 6000 gallons a day of Butanes plus (Propane/Butane mix) product stream with a composition of 2 % Ethane, 21.2 % Propane, 8.9 % iso-Butane, 32.5% n-Butane, 9.5% iso-pentane and 11.7% n-Pentane.  The balance of the fluid mix is heavy ends commonly known as C6 plus (Hexane, Heptane, Octane and Nonane). \n\nEthane, Propane, iso-Butane, n-Butane iso-Pentane and n-Pentane are regulated substances each with a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\n\nBecause of the volume of stored regulated substances vs. the transient gas stream, only the storage area was evaluated when determining RMP eligibility or Program level.

The facility then produces into the 30,000 gallon vessel while the others are being shipped by truck. Procedurally, the facility is limited to 50,000 gallons on-site storage and this amount was used when evaluating the Worst Case Scenario\n\n \nWorst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nWe used RMP*Comp\u00bf and calculated a mixture of flammable substance stream as:\n\u00bfEthane as 2% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 3.11 lbs per/gallon = 3,110 lbs\n\u00bfPropane as 21.2% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 4.224 lbs per/gallon = 44,774 lbs\n\u00bfiso-Butane as 8.9% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 4.685 lbs per/gallon = 20,848 lbs.\n\u00bfn-Butane as 32.5% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 4.865 lbs per/gallon = 79,056 lbs.\n\u00bfiso-Pentane as 9.5% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 5.194 lbs per/gallon = 24,672 lbs.\n\u00bfn-Pentane as 11.7% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 5.248 lbs per/gallon = 30,701 lbs.\n\u00bfTOTAL = 203,161 lbs\n\nThis gave us a worst case scenario (Worst Case assumes the entire contents were released and formed a vapor cloud which detonated) distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi of 0.5 miles.  There are approximately 7 homes with an estimated 21 residents within the 0.5 mile radius of Oneida Extraction Plant.  A ridge line on either side of the facility protects all but one of these residents from impact of a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nThe Alternate release scenario involves a Pull-Away explosion of a driver failing to remove the hose while loading.  This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the hose (2\u00bf x 25\u00bf) of 4.1 gallons = ~17 lbs.  The scenario estimates a sudden release"

Again, the ridge line on either side of the facility protects all but one of these residences from impact of a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents with specific offsite consequences at the Oneida Extraction Plant in the past five years\nProgram Level\n\nWith public receptors within the distance to an endpoint from a worst case release and being subject to OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard, the result is HGP being assigned a Program 3 process.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Oneida Extraction Plant is subject to OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals(PSM)..  The PSM program was implemented in January of 2002.\n\nThe Oneida Extraction Plant covered by the Columbia Natural Resources ISO-14001 Environmental Management System certificate.\n\nThe Oneida Extraction Plant is also subject to EPA\u00bfs 40 CFR 112.7 Spill Prevention Countermeasures and Control standard.  An SPCC is in place to establish procedures to prevent contain and control a hydrocarbon release.\n\nThe Oneida Extraction Plant complies with NFPA standard 58.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a fire at the Oneida Extraction Plant, employees may respond to an incipient stage fire and then must evacuate the facility.  An Emergency Action Plan developed to 29 CFR 1910.38(a) is in place to establish procedures for the safe evacuation of the facility and summon emergency response organizations. The Oneida Extraction Plant has coordinated response with the Oneida Volunteer Fire Department.  Members of the fire department have inspected the liquid storage system."
