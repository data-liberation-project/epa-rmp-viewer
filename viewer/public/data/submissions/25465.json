Carolina Culinary Foods utilizes a refrigeration system that is a closed loop system containing anhydrous ammonia.  The entire amount of anhydrous ammonia on site is approximately 32,000 pounds and is entirely contained in one system that is used for plant refrigeration and product freezing.  Carolina Culinary Foods is committed to the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system and the implementation of the requirements under the Risk Management Program of 40 CFR Part 68 and the Process Safety Management Program of 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods, L.P. is dedicated to the safe operation of its refrigeration system and to the safety of the employees, public, and environment.  Carolina Culinary Foods conducts employee training in accordance with the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  We also perform annual HAZWOPER training and retraining of key employees who will perform entry work during an ammonia release.  Carolina Culinary Foods has also invited the Cayce Fire Department and Lexington County HAZMAT members onsite to make them more aware and informed of our plant, process, and system.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods has developed models of the release scenarios at this facility to identify potential affected areas.  A commercial computer model, Phast Professional, was used to develop the models. This is not an exact prediction of what would occur in the event of a release, but an estimate of the affected area and the resources needed in the event of a release.\n\nThe \"worst-case scenario\" involves using the Low Temperature Recirculator LTR-1 as a storage vessel at 80% capacity and the vessel ruptures releasing approximately "

      "FacilityID": 25465,
      "SummaryText": "15,680 pounds of ammonia.  This model assumes the release of all the vessel contents.  Depending on wind direction, residences and businesses at a distance of 3.48 miles could be affected.  Approximately 23,726 people live within a 3.48 mile radius of the facility.  This type release is not likely to occur because of the stringent construction codes for pressure vessels and annual inspections of the pressure vessels.\n\nThe \"alternative release scenario\" involves an over-pressurization of the condensing tower resulting in a relief valve discharge.  A discharge of the relief valve at approximately 59 pounds per minute for 9 to 10 minutes would result in a total of 577 pounds of ammonia being released.  This would result in a release endpoint of 0.16 miles.  Depending on the wind direction residences and businesses could be affected.  Approximately 42 people live within the 0.16 mile radius generated by this release scenario.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nNo accidents in past five years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and has implemented a Process Safety Management Program to minimize the exposure of its employees, the public, and the environment from an anhydrous ammonia release.  The ammonia system is constantly monitored by computer and by employees to ensure that all equipment is operating within expected parameters.  Procedures have been written and implemented on how to properly isolate and shutdown the refrigeration system components in the event of an emergency.  Multiple safety devices are used on each piece of equipment to protect from an accidental release.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods has developed a plan to provide notification and evacuation of plant employees and the surrounding public.  Procedures have been developed to notify  the Cayce Fire Department and Lexington County HAZMAT Team to respond to any substantial ammonia release.  "

      "SummaryText": "Procedures have also been developed for the notification of  the Lexington County LEPC and the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).  Key employees have been trained in either 24 or 40 Hour HAZWOPER so that they will be able to assist the Cayce Fire Department and Lexington County HAZMAT with stopping an ammonia release.  Members of the Cayce Fire Department and Lexington County HAZMAT have been onsite to keep themselves more familiar with the process and the plant layout.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPeriodic inspections and tests are performed on the system including an annual complete inspection and a 5-year independent inspection.  Carolina Culinary Foods, L.P. performs a complete review of the refrigeration process when there have been changes to its design.  Through this review process we identify and implement changes to improve system safety."
