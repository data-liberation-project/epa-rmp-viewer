      "SummaryText": "STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe stationary source is defined as the Oak Farms Dairy facility located at 3417 Leeland Street, Houston, Texas.\n\nOak Farms Dairy produces fluid milk products and is equipped with two refrigeration systems containing anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S. #7664-41-7. The second refrigeration system was added in 2011 and is scheduled to be started up on October 26, 2011.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility. The #1 Ammonia Refrigeration System contains approximately 30,000 pounds of ammonia and the #2 Ammonia Refrigeration System contains approximately 13,000 pounds of ammonia.  Both exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls. Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded or if ammonia is detected at a level of 50 ppm by any one of the ammonia detectors. Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel. The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels. Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.  Any discharge of the safety relief valves from the #2 refrigeration system is to a water diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE SCENARIOS\n\nComputer air models were developed based on a worst case release scenario involving the catastrophic structural failure of the system receiver. The receiver can potentially contain the largest quantity of ammonia in a single vessel at this facility. The worst case scenario is considered to be the total capacity of ammonia in the #2 refrigeration system high pressure receiver including the amount of ammonia that could drain back from the condenser.  Currently, this worst case is not possible because the charge in the entir"

The model was produced using OCA guidance, including RMPComp.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has developed a prevention program which complies with the requirements of OSHA CFR 29, 1910.119 Process Safety Management and EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan. This program includes procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without catastrophic release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event. A third party response contractor is notified of an uncontrolled release event. The local fire department has been included in the notification and action plan. Oak Farms Dairy personnel are trained to assist the responders with information only, and would not participate in actual response.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or reportable incidents at this facility in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA new separate and independent \"2nd Ammonia Refrigeration System\" has been installed and is scheduled to be charged with ammonia and started up on October 26, 2011.  Changes to the No. 1 Ammonia Refrigeration System are scheduled to occur over the next 9 months.  One change is planned to be completed in November 2011 includes switching the ten evaporators in Vault 4 from the #1 Ammonia Refrigeration System to the #2 Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Other changes to the No. 1 Ammonia Refrigeratin System will also be made and covered by \"Management of Change\" procedures as well.   "
