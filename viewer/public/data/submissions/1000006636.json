In addition, the Pasadena PVC facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (\u00c2\u00bfSSP\u00c2\u00bf) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  \n\nThe facility is a member of the Pasadena Local Emergency Planning Committee (\u00c2\u00bfLEPC\u00c2\u00bf), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (\u00c2\u00a7 68.155(g))\n\nThe Pasadena PVC facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.  Specific changes include installation of additional process controls and enhancements related to the Pasadena Modernization Project."
