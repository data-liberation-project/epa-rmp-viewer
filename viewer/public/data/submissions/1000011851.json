              "Description": "Prevention Program Description:\nFieldale Farms Corporation takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Fieldale Farms management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:  \nProcess Safety Information(PSI), Process Hazard Analysis(PHA), Operating Procedures,\nTraining, Mechanical Integrity(MI), Management of Change(MOC), Pre-startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit  \nand Contractors   \nThese individual elements of our accident prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Fieldale Farms Corporation and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems are designed, installed and maintained in accordance with the PSM rule and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) consensus standards.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we meet both IIAR and our own high standards for accident prevention.  \n1.  In accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(d) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms systematically controls the creation, updating and retention of written documentation associated with our process chemicals, process technology and process equipment.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our Risk Management Program.  \n2.  In accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(e) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms uses Process Hazards Analyses(PHAs) to systematically identify, evaluate and control process hazards.  The most important products of our PHAs are the recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases.  Fieldale Farms ensures that all recommendations from our PHAs are resolved appropriately and we ensure that information from our PHAs (including recommendation resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees. \n3.  In accordance with Section 68.69 of the RMP rule and Section 11910.119(f) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms uses Operating Procedures to define how process related job tasks assigned to our personnel should be performed to avoid incidents.  We use these procedures to(1)train our employees before they perform tasks in the field(2)serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks and(3)specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs. \n4.  In accordance with Section 68.71 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.199(g) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms trains our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks within the context of the PSM rule and IIAR recommended practices.  Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process/equipment changes are made.  As part of the Fieldale Farms training we include provisions for ensuring that emplyees understand their training, written test, field demonstrations, etc.     \n5.  In accordance with Section 68.73 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(j) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms maintains the Mechanical Integrity(MI) of our process equipment using an inspection and testing program plus a quality assurance program.  Fieldale Farms ensures that our equipment is designed and installed per IIAR standards so that it operates properly.  We train our maintenance personnel in the hazards of the process and we also provide additional training on procedures for maintaining the ongoing integrity of our process equipment so that job tasks are performed safely.  \n6.  In accordance with Section 68.75 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(l) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms evaluates and approves all proposed changes (i. e. modifications that are not replacements in kind) to covered process chemicals, technnology, equipment and procedures prior to implementation through our Management Of Change(MOC) program.  This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated and that our employees and contract employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. We use this close scrutiny of all changes to help ensure that changes do not adversely impact employees, public safety or the environment. \n7.  In accordance with Section 68.77 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(i) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms performs a pre-startup review as a final check to ensure the safety of a new or modified process before it is placed in service.  \n8.  In accordance with Section 68.79 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(o) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms audits our RMP process to be certain that our prevention program is effective.  Our compliance audit program seeks to confirm that the RMP prevention program practices for the covered process are consistent with written programs that the program adequately addresses all requirements to the RMP regulations and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.  \n9.  In accordance with Section 68.81 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(m) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms performs incident investigations to help ensure that incidents with catastrophic magnitude or potential for catastrophic magnitude are thoroughly investigated, root causes are indentified and corrected plus relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence of the incident.\n10.  In accordance with Section 68.83 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(c) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing the RMP program.  \n11.  In accordance with Section 68.85 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(k) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms uses the hot work permit program to ensure that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar flame or spark producing operations) begins on or near an RMP covered process.  \n12. In accordance with Section 68.87 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(h) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule, Fieldale Farms has contractor screening procedures to help ensure that we hire and use only contractors who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of our plant employees, the public or the environment.     \nFieldale Farms Corporation and our employees have implemented the above mentioned elements of our RMP and PSM programs to ensure the safety of our employees, the pubic and the environment.
