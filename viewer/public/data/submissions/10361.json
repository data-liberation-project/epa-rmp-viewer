      "SummaryText": "1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response policies:\nAt KTI Georgia plant, which is a plastic film coating process facility, we handle propane which is one of EPA's listed hazardous chemical.   Propane is listed as a flammable hazard.  We store and utilize propane as an alternate fuel source for fueling our boilers during the natural gas curtailment in the winter season.\n\nKTI managers and employees recognize that propane has flammable properties which make it a very useful fuel but at the same time a serious hazard to the health and lives of people within KTI's compound as well as the surrounding community.  The employees handle propane observing all safety precautions in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure, for the well being of our co-workers and nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all state and federal regulations, as well as, all safety precautions stipulated in the manufacturer's MSDS.\n\nKTI has an emergency response program which is distributed to the Local Emergency Response center, the Local Fire Department, and the Hospital.  This emergency response program has a procedure for notifying the Fire Department and the National Response Center.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handling:\nPropane at this facility is kept in a bulk storage container which has a maximum storage capacity of 30,000 gallons.  Normal storage at the plant is that of 65% to 75% of the storage capacity.  This storage tank is rated at a designed working pressure of 250psig and constructed to the ASME  boiler and pressure vessel code.  The plant provides gas at 8psig.\n\nInstallation of the plant at this facility conformed to the requirements of the state of Georgia, NFPA #58: Storage and Handling of liquefied petroleum gases; NFPA #54: National fuel gas code and NFPA #70: National electricial code.\n\nThe regulated substance at this facility is propane.  Propane is stored to a maximum amount of 99,000 pounds.  The maximum amou"

      "SummaryText": "nt that is capable of storage is 132,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s):\nWorst-Case scenario:  *\nThe worst-case of a release would be for the storage tank to rupture.  In this case the tank would release its entire contents.  The company's practice is to store 75%, or less, of storage capacity at about 65 deg. Fahr.  This would result in a maximum of 99,000 lb. of propane release to the atmosphere, and a vapor cloud explosion.\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for the worse-case scenario will be no more than 0.38 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Scenario:-  A broken 3\" pipe in the system.  This would release vapor at a rate of about 1650 lb. per hour, from the OCA alternate release scenario look-up, with end point of about 0.17 miles.\n\n\n4.   The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\nThe propane storage tank at KTI is equipped with several shut-off valves.   It is also equipped with over pressure safety valve.  Our maintenance program includes inspection procedures which will reduce the probability of accidental releases occuring. \n\n\n\n5. Five-year accident history.\n\nWe have had no accidental release or other accident with the propane plant at our facility in the last five years.\n\n6.The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based and prepared for responding to flammable catastropic situations.  This program is also enhanced by our \"Fire prevention and first responders\" procedures.  The plan shows the quickest escape routes and the employees assembly area for roll-call.\n\nThis program outlines the procedures each employee must follow and clearly states that employees must call  the emergency number, \"911\".\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\nThere are no immediate planned changes.  However, we are dedicated to continuous improvements in our process and maintenance procedures.  This facility was constructed in 1987 and is in compliance with a"
