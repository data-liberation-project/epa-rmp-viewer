The RMPr includes all Program 2 Accident Prevention Program elements: Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, and Emergency Response.  \n\n\n\nCovered Process 1 (i.e. Railcar Storage ? Anhydrous Ammonia) operations consist of receiving and staging 34,000-gallon railcars containing anhydrous ammonia.  A typical railcar shipment includes 10 to 15 railcars.  However, the maximum number of anhydrous ammonia railcars that have been temporarily stored at the Facility is 20.  Therefore, the Facility is reporting its maximum quantity to be 20 anhydrous ammonia railcars.  \n\n\n\nThe Facility does not own the railcars and therefore is not responsible for the mechanical integrity of the railcar.  However, trained Facility personnel receive, inspect, and release railcars in accordance with the RMPr Railcar Operating Procedures.  The Facility is responsible for training its personnel in the Railcar Operating Procedures.  Transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the railcars to Covered Processes 3, 5, and 7 is addressed under those specific covered processes.\n\n",

The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. \n\n\n\nCovered Process 5 (i.e. Aqua Ammonium Blending) operations consist of transferring and mixing anhydrous ammonia and water in a reacting chamber to make aqua ammonia, and then transferring the aqua ammonia to ASTs for storage (Covered Process 6).  This Facility produces aqua ammonia products that have ammonia concentrations greater than 20% and at quantities that exceed 20,000 lbs.  Covered Process 5 equipment includes one (1) or two (2) 34,000-gallon railcars, railcar nipple adaptors, emergency shutoff valves, transfer hoses, process piping, control valves, and two Blenders (Aqua Blenders 1 and 2).  The Blenders are physically connected by process piping and transfer hoses to the railcar when in operation.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the Blenders by the pressure in the railcars.  With the exception of the railcars, the aqua ammonium blending equipment is owned and operated by the Facility.      \n\n\n\nTrained Facility personnel operate the covered process which includes the: (1) making connection of the railcar to the riser and opening valves; (2) transfer of anhydrous ammonia and water to the blender; (3) monitoring of flows, temperatures, and pressures; (4) transfer of aqua ammonia to the ASTs for storage and monitoring fluid levels; and (5) closing valves and disconnecting the railcar.  These operations are conducted in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Operating Procedures.  Trained personnel perform maintenance on this covered process in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Mechanical Integrity Procedures.\n\n",

              "Description": "The Facility Fertilizer Manager implements the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and combined Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program (PSM/RMPr) for the OSHA and RMP covered process at this Facility and is assisted by other trained employees as directed. The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. \n\n\n\nAmmonium Polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer is produced by blending anhydrous ammonia with super-phosphoric acid in a reacting chamber and then mixing with water.  The process equipment is physically connected by transfer hose to the process piping connected to one (1) 34,000 gallon railcar containing anhydrous ammonia.  The process equipment consists of a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  The MPR ancillary equipment includes transfer hoses, liquid pumps, process piping, reacting chamber, valves, pumps, evaporative cooling tower, flow meters, and pressure and temperature gauges.  The MPR does not have any storage capabilities for anhydrous ammonia. The APP product is not subject to the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThis covered process is subject to the OSHA PSM regulations and the IFRC is responsible for the development and implementation of its PSM.  Contractor Process Operators operate the covered process which includes the: (1) transfer of anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid, and water to the MPR; (2) monitoring of flows, temperatures, and pressures; and (3) transfer of APP to storage.  The IFRC is responsible for training its Operators in accordance with the IFRC PSM.  The Facility requires that the IFRC have in place and demonstrates compliance with its OSHA PSM for the MPR operations.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis EPA RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r), OSHA 29 CFR ? 1910.119, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68. The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC (Helena) is resubmitting the EPA RMP as a 5-year update.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 and 3 PSM/RMPr Facility have been addressed.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Operations at this Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling, manufacturing, retail sale and distribution.  Two chemicals (i.e. anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration) are stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\no    Covered Process 1: Railcar Storage (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 2: Railcar Storage (Aqua Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 3: Anhydrous Ammonia transfer to Tanker Truck\n\no    Covered Process 4: Aqua Ammonia Transfer to Storage Tanks\n\no    Covered Process 5: Aqua Ammonia Blending\n\no    Covered Process 6: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia)\n\no    Covered Process 7: Ammonium Polyphosphate (APP) Blending\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the total quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the Facility is 3,302,072 lbs (assuming that twenty (20) 34,000-gallon railcars are filled to their administrative capacity), and the total ammonia (concentration 20% or greater) in the aqua ammonia that can be stored at the Facility is 769,774 lbs (assuming that the nine (9) 22,000-gallon railcars and five (5) ASTs are filled to t"

The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  For the anhydrous ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 1, 3, 5, and 7), the worst case release was modeled as if a 34,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia railcar was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.  For the aqua ammonia, two releases were modeled.  One worst case release scenario (i.e. representing Covered Processes 2 and 4) assumes that a 22,000-gallon aqua ammonia railcar failed and instantaneously spills the content into an area with no secondary containment resulting in a release being evaporation at the maximum temperature.  The other worst case release scenario (i.e. representing Covered Process 6) assumes that the 46,000-gallon aqua ammonia AST fails within the secondary containment resulting in a contained release being evaporation at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia due to (1) the failure to fully close a vapor valve on a railcar (Covered Process 1), and (2) rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation associated with Covered Processes 3, 5, and 7.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation associated with Covered Processes 2 and 4, and a release of aqua ammonia due to a rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose during a major loading operation associated with Covered Process 6.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at"
