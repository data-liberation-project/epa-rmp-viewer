Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response \npolicies \n\nWe at Carter Lake Filter Plant are committed to employee, \npublic and environmental safety.  This commitment is \ndemonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention \nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, \noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training \nassociated with the processes at our facility.  It is our \npolicy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible \nreleases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a \nrelease does occur, our highly trained emergency response \npersonnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects \nof the release. We are also completely coordinated with \nBerthoud Fire District which provides additional emergency \nresponse expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances \nHandled\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility. \nThe substances is Chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is \n18000 lbs.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative \nRelease Scenario, including administrative controls and \nmitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported \nscenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our \nfacility, we have used the look-up tables and equations \nprovided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis \nGuidance. The following paragraphs provide details of the \nchosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-Case Analyses\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from \nNorth Plant Chlorine room.  The scenario involves the release \nof 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. \nThe Release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 200. A distance \nto endpoint of 7.4 miles is obtained which affects  a \nresidential population of 15833 within this distance.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from \nSouth Plant Chlorine room.  The scenario involves the release \nof 200"

The studies \nare undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise \nin engineering and process operations and are revalidated \nperiodically.  Any findings related to the \nhazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our \ncovered processes, Carter Lake Filter Plant maintains written \noperating procedures.  These procedures address various modes \nof operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary \noperations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal \nshutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is \nregularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators \ninvolved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCarter Lake Filter Plant has a comprehensive training program \nin place to ensure that employees who are operating processes \nare competent in the operating procedures associated with \nthese processes. Refresher training is provided periodically \nyears and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCarter Lake Filter Plant carries out highly documented maintenance \nchecks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process \nequipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure \nvessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, \nemergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance \noperations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous \ntraining in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel \nare offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment \ndeficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in \na safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCarter Lake Filter Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to \ndetermine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are \nbeing implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every \n3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the \naudits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nIncident Investigation\nCarter Lake Filter Plant promptly investigates any incident \nthat has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic \nrelease of a regulated substance.  These investigations are \nundertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident \nas well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from \nreoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCarter Lake Filter Plant truly believes that process safety \nmanagement and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company \nemployees are strongly encouraged to express their views \nconcerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  \nIn addition, our employees have access to all information created \nas part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including \ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nCarter Lake Filter Plant has had an excellent record of preventing \naccidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent \nrelease prevention policies, there has been no accidental release \nduring this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\n Facility has its own written ER Plan. The ER Plan includes specific \nactions to be taken in response to accidental  releases of \nregulated substances. The ER Plan includes procedures for informing \nthe public and local agencies for responding to accidental release.\nThe ER Plan does include information on emergency health care.\nDate of most recent review/update of ER Plan: 5/11/99\nDate of most recent ER training of employees: \nThe Local agency coordinating ER Plan is Berthoud Fire District which \nhas the phone number 970-532-2264\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nNo major developments or findings have resulted from the implementation \nof the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  "
