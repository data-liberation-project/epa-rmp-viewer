If the chlorine sensor detects a specified level, audio and visual alarms will be activated.  The alarm is routed to an automatic dialer, which calls the control room, project manager, the on-call operator.  The alarm system is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation should there be a chlorine release.

The program is described in detail in the Stephenville WWTP manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which includes facillity notification of emergency responders and evacuation.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effect of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.

(OMI).  This executive summary also includes steps taken during the course of the five-year RMP update.\n\n1.0  Prevention and Response Policies\nOMI believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its emplyees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, OMI has develped proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active emplyee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Stephenville WWTP RMP for the chlorine system.  OMI has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also appliesto the personnel at the Stephenville WWTP and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, OMI affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements requireb the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no rekeases would occur.  Accordingly, a well developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.  OMI takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the facilities it operates by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards as"

The employees that work on the chlorine system are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.  \n\nOMI management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Stephenville WWTP RMP procedures and policies.  \n\nAs for emergency response, OMI has established and maintained procedures for emergemcy notification response.  This are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\n2.0  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Stephenville WWTP is located in Erath County, Texas.  The Stephenville WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  This wastewater treatment facility is an activated sludge, oxidation ditch aeration plant with both primary and secondary clarifiers.  The plant has an average design flow of 3.0 MGD.\n\nThe Stephenville WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of two containers (4,000 pounds) on site.  Therefore, the Stephenville WWTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.\n\nAs required by the RMP regulation, OMI has updated the offsite consequence analysis and reported it to EPA using RMP*Submit 2004.\n\n3.0  Prevention Steps for Chlorine\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Stephenville WWTP RMP manual.
