Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, National Raisin Dehydrator has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 National Raisin Dehydrator, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that National Raisin Dehydrator has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name         | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nSulfur Dioxide         Sulfur Dioxide              8,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet CalAR"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\r\n\r\n1.2 Process Description\r\n\r\nNational Raisin Dehydrator operates a dehydrating facility that utilizes sulfur dioxide chambers for color preservation in the fruit drying process. Sulfur dioxide is piped from a ton-container to each chamber using pipe and ball valves. When in use, each chamber receives 80-90 lb of sulfur dioxide gas.\r\n\r\nThe sulfur dioxide containers at Del Rey Packing consists of vessels which are co-located such that a release of sulfur dioxide could impact the ability to operate vessels which are not directly connected. Therefore, we are treating both containers as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of sulfur dioxide in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nNational Raisin Dehydrator has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the sulfur dioxide process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Sulfur-Dioxide\r\n\r\nThe sulfur-dioxide process at the National Raisin Dehydrator facility is an integral part of overall business and lasts for approximately two months out of the year. The sulfur-dioxide process contains multiple cylinders with a maximum inventory of [8,000 (lbs.)]. It is extremely important that these areas a"

National Raisin Dehydrator is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of exposure to sulfur-dioxide.\r\nOur personnel also monitor the sulfur-dioxide fumigation process and keep an active log of all associated procedures and transactions. In addition, the process is checked frequently during the season by the outside contractor that supplies the SO2 cylinders. The contractor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our process equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNational Raisin Dehydrator has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nNational Raisin Dehydrator's emergency action and response program has been developed to \r\n\r\nsatisfy the following requirements:\r\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR \u00a75189(n)\r\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119(n)\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 \u00a72765.1-2765.2\r\n- USEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 40 CFR \u00a768.95\r\n- California Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) [Emergency Response Plans and Procedures] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4 \u00a72731\r\n- California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 \u00a75192(q)\r\n- Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.120(q)\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release"

Nevertheless, National Raisin Dehydrator continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved National Raisin Dehydrator's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that National Raisin Dehydrator's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nNational Raisin Dehydrator has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, National Raisin Dehydrator has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, National Raisin Dehydrator now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for National Raisin Dehydrator employees, but al"
