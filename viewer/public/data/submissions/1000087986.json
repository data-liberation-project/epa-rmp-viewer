      "SummaryText": "This executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Recycling Plant, one of several facilities owned and operated by Denver Water.\n\n\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nDenver Water believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Denver Water has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Recycling Plant RMP for the chlorine system. \n\n\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\n\n\nDenver Water takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine at the Recycling Plant) and actively participated in comprehensive hazard analyses.  The system employees are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered process and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\n\n\nDenver Water management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have "

This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Recycling Plant RMP procedures and policies.\n\n\n\nAs for emergency response, Denver Water has established procedures for emergency response and notification when necessary.  Recycling Plant employees are responsible for providing initial response to a release of chlorine.  Releases contained within the plant facilities will be remedied by Recycling Plant personnel and equipment, in accordance with OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR 1910.120).  Releases affecting (or with the potential to affect) areas outside the facility will require outside assistance, and local emergency response entities will be solicited for emergency response support.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Recycling Plant is located at 5650 York Street in Commerce City, Colorado.  The chlorine system was originally installed in 2003 with operations commencing in February 2004.\n\n\n\nThe facility provides recycled water for non-potable use.  Facility influent consists of flows from either, or both, of the treatment plants at the Robert W Hite Wastewater Treatment Facility.  The Recycling plant effluent is for industrial, commercial and irrigation customers, and will meet all Colorado standards for Category 3 reclaimed domestic wastewater Colorado Regulation 84.  The facility has a dedicated pumping system to Xcel Energy and a main line to all other customers.\n\n\n\nBiological nitrification, followed by conventional water treatment technologies to remove phosphorus, ammonia, solids, and pathogens (chemical treatment, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration) are used at this location.  The water is further treated by the addition of chlorine, aqueous ammonia, and sodium hydroxide.  The chlorine (Cl2) is stored in the east side of Chemical Building.\n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the Recycling Plant will"

Therefore, the Recycling Plant is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.\n\n\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine System\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the RMP Management System document and the RMP Share Point site. The prevention programs include the following elements:\n\n- Safety Information, which has been collated into the RMP Share Point site.\n\n- Hazard Reviews - Every 5-years a knowledgeable group of employees conducts the Hazard Review to ensure consideration is given to possible events that may cause chlorine leaks. In addition, major changes generate an updated hazard review.\n\n- Operating procedures for applicable processes are maintained on the RMP Share Point site.\n\n- Training for all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system.\n\n- Incident investigation procedures for the investigation of any catastrophic (or potentially catastrophic) incident associated with the chlorine system, using the Denver Water Incident Investigation Report procedures.\n\n- Compliance audits to be conducted at least once every three years to ensure the continued compliance of the Plant's RMP programs.\n\n- In addition to these elements, the chlorine storage room at the Recycling Plant is equipped with a chlorine scrubber, which will evacuate chlorine-laden air from the chlorine storage and feed areas, reducing the concentration of chlorine gas to safe levels prior to discharge to the atmosphere.  The four-stage scrubber will pull vapors out of both the chlorine storage and feed rooms.  An exhaust fan pulls air into the scrubber and into a multistage chamber, exposing it to caustic spray and a mist eliminator prior to discharge to the exhaust stack.  The scrubber has an exhaust detector to monitor the chlorine concentration in the discharge stack. Dampers allow for makeup air to enter the chlorine storage and"

The end of this vent stack is 6 feet above the roofline.   Overall scrubber removal efficiency is 99+%, with an estimated chlorine concentration < 5 ppm going out the stack.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine storage room has leak detectors.  There are also leak detectors in the chlorine injector/feed room. An alarm of 0.5 ppm alerts the technician of a leak and 4 ppm or greater at any of these four leak detectors will activate the scrubber.  They will also trigger red, flashing alarm beacons, audible alarms (local and over the plant intercom system), and control room alarms to warn other personnel.  Leak detectors will be calibrated for a range of 0-10 ppm, with digital chlorine level readout locally, outside of the room, and in the control room.  The system also closes seven of the eight emergency shutoff valves on the on-line group of ton containers, and closes all emergency shutoff valves on the remaining two off-line groups of ton containers.\n\nIn addition to the chlorine leak detectors in the Chemical Building, there are also two chlorine leak detectors in the Distribution Pump Station and in the filter building.  These detectors will alert plant staff of a break in the chlorine solution lines in those buildings only, and are not tied to scrubber controls.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine scrubber will be maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a chlorine release event.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nSince the facility inception in 2003, there have been no releases of hazardous air pollutants from the Recycling Plant with off-site consequences during the past five years.  The chlorine system was installed in 2003, with construction completed in February 2004.  These systems incorporate up-to-date safety measures to help prevent releases.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nDenver Water has established p"

Employee meetings that focus on safety issues will be held regularly at the Recycling Plant.  Employees will be encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\n\n\nAs part of the development of the Recycling Plant RMP program, a hazard analyses was conducted and recently reviewed with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all have been considered.  The exercise and HAZWOPER training have provided affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."
