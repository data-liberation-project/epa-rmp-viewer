Senior management as well as Human Resources administer the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSunrise Growers has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Sunrise Growers to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\n\nThe majority of the equipment is located inside the engine rooms.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe facility is located in a rural area at 1315 South Blosser Road, in Santa Maria, California, which is approximately 2.0 miles east of Highway 101, and approximately 0.2 miles south of Highway 166.  The facility began operations in 1956 and expanded in 1980.  The facility provides refrigeration for cold and freezer storage of fruits and vegetables.  At the time of construction and facility expansion, the ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulation"

The two systems are connected via one ammonia liquid and one ammonia suction line.  Unless the facility is transferring liquid from system 1 to system 2, the connection lines are normally closed. The total charge of the ammonia systems combined was calculated by Appco in 2012 and found to be 42,098 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nSystem 1's refrigeration cycle begins with the collection of high pressure liquid ammonia in the High Pressure Receivers (3) from the Condensers.  The High Pressure Receivers serve as the main liquid storage vessels for system 1.  The High Pressure Receivers provide high pressure liquid ammonia to the Pre-cool Pump Package, Belt Freezer (IQF #9), Poly Bag Room Evaporators, and Intercooler.  The High Pressure Receivers also provide liquid injection, for oil cooling, to High Stage Compressors #8, #9, #10, and Booster Compressors #6 and #8.\n\n\n\nHigh pressure liquid ammonia passing through the Intercooler is provided to the Blast Cell Recirculators (2), Freezer Accumulators (3), Sure Fresh Pump Package, Berry Cool Pump Package, and when needed, system 2.  Suction from these areas is drawn off by the Booster Compressors and Suction Accumulator/Slop Tank prior to entering the High Stage Compressors.  Booster Compressor discharge is routed to the Intercooler. Suction from the Poly Bag Room passes through the Suction Accumulator/Slop Tank prior to entering the High Stage Compressors.  After a predetermined amount of liquid has accumulated in the Suction Accumulator's Transfer Unit, the Transfer Unit opens the high pressure hot gas line, forcing the accumulated liquid out of the vessel and into the High Pressure Receivers.\n\n\n\nSystem 1 has a total of 64 Evaporators/Coil Units and an IQF Freezer.

The high pressure vapor is condensed by discharging latent heat in the ammonia to the atmosphere using sprayed water and fans.  High Stage Compressor discharge is also used for the defrosting of the Poly Bag Room, Vestibule Area (Dock), Holding Rooms, Berry Cooler Pressure Coolers/Blowers, Berry Cooler, Freezer Room #3, and Blast Cell Evaporators/Coil Units.  \n\n\n\nAn auto purger periodically purges system 1 of non-condensibles collected in the Condensers.

System 1 is also equipped with an Under-Floor Heat Exchanger which is used for heating of the freezer area floors.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration process equipment associated with system 2 does not operate continuously.

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation, the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to regularly maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\n\n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine rooms and throughout the facility.  During the PHA Revalidation conducted on February 20-21, 2014, the facility was installing new  ammonia sensors.  In case of ammonia detection, an offsite monitoring station receives an alarm and then proceeds to alert the facility.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations"

In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to atmosphere via relief lines which penetrate through the roof.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately by the refrigeration contractor.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\" is used as a general guide.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\"\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?

They have an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. The Emergency Action Plan was last updated on August 20, 2007.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the County of Santa Barbara Fire Department ((805) 681-5500) and the City of Santa Maria Fire Department (Fire Station #1 (805) 925-0951 Ext. 257).  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the Department of Public Safety Emergency Management Services.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center and the Emergency Spill Report Center will be called.  The table below details the emergency notification list and contact phone numbers. All employees and contractors will evacuate based on a high ammonia leak alarm.\n\n\n\nSunrise Growers maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, "
