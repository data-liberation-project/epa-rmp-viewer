This commitment is strongly supported by company management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, which include, but are not limited to training and safety in the operation, and maintenance of the plant.  The facility implements both administrative and engineering controls to minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a flammable substance.  An uncontrolled release is not anticipated.  In the event such a release should occur, the personnel at the plant, in cooperation with local response agencies, are able to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees, contractors, and the surrounding area.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Hainesville Natural Gas Processing Plant receives raw natural gas from producing wells.  The raw natural gas enters the processing plant by pipeline where it is treated to remove water and other contaminants.  Residue gas in the form of methane leaves the plant by pipeline to sales.  Natural gas liquids and condensate are stored at the plant site prior to sales.  Propane is also stored at the plant.   Listed flammable components of the stored natural gas liquids include methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane and isopentane.  These llisted components, along with 2,2-dimethylpropane, also a flammable, make up the condensate.  Natural gas liquids and condensate leave the plant by transport vehicles.  There are no regulated toxic substances stored at the plant. Operators are knowledgeable as to the activation of the emergency shutdown, which will limit the exposure of any relea"

The assumption is made that the entire contents of the tank is released at once.  The release scenario was calculated using the Environmental Protection Agency's RMP*COMP(TM).  Employees visually inspect the plant each day and provide any necessary maintenance, thereby decreasing the possibility of any release to the outside environment.  A preventive maintenance program further reduces the possibility of a release equal to the Worst Case Scenario. \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS-Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is the assumption of a release of the natural gas liquids contained within one 30,000-gallon tank over a ten-minute period. The release scenario was calculated using the Environmental Protection Agency's RMP*COMP(TM).  Employees visually inspect the plant each day and provide any necessary maintenance, thereby decreasing the possibility of any release to the outside environment.  A preventive maintenance program further reduces the possibility of a release equal to the Alternative Release Scenario. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Hainesville Plant is regulated by many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standards and Regulations.  It also complies with regulations governed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Among many regulations, this facility is regulated by Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), and Section 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans).  It is also governed by Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure).

These regulations include the control of emission releases outlined in the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission Air Regulations and the Statewide Rules for Oil, Gas and Geothermal Operations governed by the Railroad Commission of Texas.\n\nThe facility Accident Prevention Program  incorporates all of  the requirements of Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and EPA's Risk Management Program.  Other safety practices followed at the plant are found in the many plans,  procedures and documents maintained on site.  This information, along with the employee and contractor training program, is used for the prevention, or mitigation of any chemical release.  The Accident Prevention Program is used in the identification, evaluation, prevention or mitigation of chemical releases resulting from a failure in processes, procedures or equipment.  The Employee Participation Program results in the development of the necessary expertise, experience, judgement and initiative within the workforce.\n\nEmployees have received comprehensive training.
