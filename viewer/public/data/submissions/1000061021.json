Being a food processing facility, UniSea has gone far and above requirements so that even a small incidental release is dealt with quickly, before any contamination of our product can occur.\r\n\r\nWe have been in the OSHA VPP process since 1996 and have achieved both MERIT and STAR status.

We have been under PSM since its adoption and have performed Process Hazards Analysis (PHA's) for Ammonia.  \r\n\r\nOur emergency response program involves several groups of employees in Dutch Harbor.  From our Power Plant to our Security group, both of which operate 24 hours a day.  Emergency response plans are at both locations along with several others.  The plans are exercised on a regular basis, either through drills or actual responses or requests from outside sources.  \r\n\r\nWe have instituted a change in our management process known to us as (EVERYDAY FOCUS), as part of that process every two weeks all managers m"

Part of that status requirement is injury information and upcoming changes that affect safety within our organization.  This process has required managers and supervisors to become much more involved in the day to day issue of safety as they are now required to report occurrences, with solutions for remediation."
