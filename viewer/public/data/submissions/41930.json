THE POTENTIAL QUANTITY RELEASE COULD BE 79,000 LBS. WHICH IS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST TANK AT 85%-AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS AS WELL AS COMPANY POLICY.  DISTANCE TO END POINT IS 1.89 MILES FROM THIS PLANT.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENERIO BASED ON INDUSTRY INFORMATION COULED BE A RELEASE FROM A PIPE OR TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO END POINT FOR THIS IS .83 MILES.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST 5 YEARS RESULTING IN ANY INJURIES, DEATH, EVACUATION, SHELTERING IN PLACE, OR OTHER EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.
