      "SummaryText": "Introduction\r\n\r\nThe Mandan Water Treatment Plant (WTP) has submitted a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, herein referred to as the \"Rule\".  As such, the Mandan WTP staff have completed a comprehensive review of the risk associated with the regulated process, water chlorination, at its facility.  Additionally, the Mandan WTP has completed an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) and has developed and implemented a prevention program to promote safe operation of the regulated process.  The facility has also updated emergency response procedures and initiated communication with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department to form a cooperative response procedure for potential releases from the facility.  The prevention program focuses on training employees in safe operating and maintenance procedures and to recognize the potential hazards associated with the regulated chemical and processes.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nThe Mandan water works was established in 1911 along the banks of the Missouri River approximately 2 miles northeast of the City.  The facility is owned and operated by the City of Mandan and currently has a design treatment capacity of approximately 12 million gallons per day (MGD).  The facility is a conventional filtration plant that incorporates pre-sedimentation, pre-treatment, lime softening, recarbonation, fluoridation, stabilization, and chloramines disinfection.  Gaseous chlorine, contained in one-ton chlorine containers, is introduced into the water using a vacuum feed system.  The facility stores a maximum of two one-ton containers onsite, for a combined total of 4,000 pounds of chlorine.  According to the Rule, any facility with greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine onsite is required to develop and implement a RMP.  Therefore, the Mandan WTP chlorination system is a Risk Management-regulated p"

Ammonia is not stored/used on site in quantities required Risk Management regulation.\r\n\r\nChlorine containers are stored in the chlorine room, which is located on the northwest corner of the facility, and is equipped with a ventilation system.  The Mandan WTP operates daily until the reservoirs are filled.  The chlorine room and its components are visually inspected at least once per day during operation.  When the system is not in operation, the chlorination system equipment and all related process valves are disabled.  The door to the chlorine room is kept locked at all times.\r\n\r\nChlorine is a toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure.  Its boiling point is -29.4A\u00b0F.  Chlorine is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and reacts violently with easily oxidized materials.  Contact with evaporating chlorine or equipment releasing flashing chlorine can cause frostbite burns.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will travel along the ground and fill low spaces and pits by displacing air.  One-ton chlorine containers are welded steel tanks with removable steel protective caps over the container valves.  They are built to meet Federal specifications, and are regularly inspected and pressure tested in accordance with Federal regulations.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Mandan WTP staff have studied their chlorination system and the potential hazards it presents onsite and offsite.  The results of this analysis are presented in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (Hazard Assessment section of the RMP), which is composed of a Worst Case and Alternate (most likely) Case Scenario.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\n\r\nAlthough the potential for a release exists, the Mandan WTP has determined that the chlorination system is safe by industry standards and that the potential for a release from the facility is very small.  The facility is working with the LEPC and the Fire Department to prepare emergency responders in the event of a major release.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e Mandan WTP employees do not respond to releases other than those that can be stopped by closing a valve and will not enter the room to stop a chlorine release if the chlorine concentration is estimated to be above safe levels.  The Mandan WTP relies on the Mandan Fire Department and the Bismarck Fire Department/Hazardous Materials Response Team (HAZMAT), which works closely with the LEPC to plan response procedures in the event of a major chlorine release at the facility.  The results of the Offsite Consequence Analysis have been communicated to the LEPC and the Fire Department.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nThe Mandan WTP has not had an incident in the past 5 years that resulted in injury onsite or offsite.  The Mandan WTP management is committed to ongoing employee training to increase awareness of the potential hazards associated with the chlorination process and to further reduce the likelihood of future accidents which may result in injury and equipment or property damage.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe day-to-day result of the Rule is the mandatory implementation of a prevention program.  The intent of the prevention program is to document procedures within the facility that promote safe operation of the regulated process and reduce the potential for an uncontrolled release of the regulated substance (chlorine gas).  Components of the prevention program include the assembly of safety information, the performance of periodic hazard reviews, the establishment of safe operating and maintenance procedures, updating training policies, conducting routine compliance audits, the development of an incident investigation procedure, and the formalization of a management system.\r\n\r\nSafety information, such as Material Safety Data Sheets and equipment specifications, have been compiled and attached to the RMP for easy access by employees.  This information specifies the safe operating limits for regulated process equipment and lists codes and standards that apply to the equipment"

A hazard review will be performed every 5 years, or prior to implementation of a new or changed process.\r\n\r\nOperating procedures relating to normal and emergency operations of the regulated process have been updated and compiled in the RMP.  Maintenance procedures have been compiled in a similar fashion.  These procedures will be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nA training policy has been developed and training records have been reviewed and updated to reflect the status of all current employees.  New employee and refresher training will be provided periodically and documented in an effort to maintain safe operating and maintenance procedures.  Refresher training will be conducted every 3 years, at a minimum.  The Mandan WTP will continue its practice of documenting all training.\r\n\r\nA compliance review policy has been developed and compliance audits, designed to review the facility's compliance with the Rule, will be conducted every 3 years.  The audits examine the components of the Risk Management Program and the implementation of each component.  \r\n\r\nAn incident investigation procedure has been developed to aid in instituting corrective actions resulting from an incident and to prevent future incidents from occurring.  This procedure establishes a timeline for completion of an incident investigation and documents any procedure changes resulting from the investigation.\r\n\r\nLastly, a management system which assigns responsibility for each component of the Risk Management Program has been instituted.
