This commitment to people and the environment is a value that cannot be compromised. No job we do or service we perform is so urgent that we cannot take the time to perform each aspect of the job in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. The Materion business management system commits each employee to comply with all applicable legal requirements, follow established procedures, prevent pollution, conserve energy, minimize waste and promote recycling. Executive management ensures the sustainability of this policy as part of its annual business planning and review process and the line organization has functional ownership in order to drive employee involvement at all levels toward the achievement of documented, clearly defined and measurable goals and objectives. This policy is shared with employees, the public, our vendors and customers.\r\n\r\nThe specific approach for accidental release prevention and emergency response is to first understand the risks and hazards associated with site chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia and then to implement and maintain management systems to manage those risks.  The management system includes elements to make employees and those who would respond to release emergencies aware of the hazards related to these chemicals.  The site has emphasized the need to implement robust management systems to prevent the release of highly hazardous chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia from the manufacturing process.  The site policy is to respond to emergencies associated with highly hazardous chemicals and to coordinate with local emergency responders when"

The emergency response program includes coordination with local emergency responders, training, drills, and alert systems in the event of evacuation.\r\n\r\nOur planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe facility continues to evolve its risk management practices.  Planned activities include conducting hazard reviews for other areas of the plant like the ones conducted on the processes utilizing anhydrous ammonia.  The Corporate Environmental, Health, and Safety group for Materion is developing and deploying to its sites including Delta additional tools that will support the site management systems for managing chemical risks.  These tools include an electronic MOC tool, compliance calendar system, ISO14001 environmental management system, and a procedure management database."

The ammonia is typically supplied to the mill via railcars.  The railcars are unloaded as needed to fill the site anhydrous ammonia storage tank that has a storage capacity of 185,000 lbs.  The part of the manufacturing process that utilizes ammonia is a small portion of the overall manufacturing processes at the facility.\r\n\r\nOur general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility has deployed Prevention Program 3 as its accident release prevention program. \r\nUnderstanding of the site chemical safety risks starts with the facility process safety information (PSI) which includes chemical safety information and manufacturing process design details.  The site has updated the PSI and utilizes this information to conduct hazard reviews and facility siting analyses.  The PSI, hazard reviews and facility siting analyses aid the site in understanding the risks from using highly hazardous chemicals in the manufacturing processes.  \r\n\r\nAdditional management system elements are utilized to aid the site in managing identified risks.  These elements that help manage identified risks include Operating Procedures for operating the manufacturing process, Employee Training including training on the operating procedures, a Management Of Change (MOC) process to manage changes to the manufacturing process, a Mechanical Integrity process to aid the site for inspection, testing and preventative maintenance of the manufacturing process equipment and Emergency Response procedures for responding to emergencies including those involving highly hazardous chemicals such as ammonia.\r\n\r\nOur five-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThe site has not had any accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program:\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains trained and equipped emer"
