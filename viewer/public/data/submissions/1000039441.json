From our beginnings as a small creamery in Southeastern Minnesota, Kemps has extended its roots to include the manufacture and marketing of fresh milk, premium ice cream and frozen yogurt, frozen novelties, sour cream and cottage cheese through retail supermarkets and food service channels. Headquartered today in St. Paul, Minnesota, we operate five manufacturing facilities in Minnesota and Wisconsin and have over 1,126 employees.\n\n\n\nKemps is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dairy Farmers of America, Inc. 100% of our profits go to dairy farmers and their families.\n\n\n\nThe Kemps LLC facility in Cedarburg (Kemps) maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated incident commanders for the facility.  Kemps has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect to provide the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed at least once per year.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\n?    Kemps is located at W55 N155 McKinley Avenue in Cedarburg, Wisconsin. The facility is approximately 5.5 miles west of Interstate 43.  The immediate area is primarily industrial and commercial areas.  The primary ammonia equipment is located in an engine room.  \n\n\n\n?    Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process and is the only regulated substance on site.\n\n\n\n?    The total ammonia inventory at the facility is 16,395 pounds.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nKemps ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. Fo"

      "SummaryText": "r example, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nThe facility, including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with various automatic process controls which ensure safe and efficient operation of the compressors, condensers, evaporators and other process equipment, suction accumulator, and regulating valves.  In addition, pressure relief valves automatically engage in the event the system experiences a very high pressure situation.  In case of an ammonia leak, ammonia detectors will provide an alert.\n\n\n\nFrom an administrative standpoint, the facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119 and a Risk Management Program for compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the Kemps accident history during the past Five-Year period, revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds (February 2009 - February 2014). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility:\n\n\n\n1.    In the event of a spill, release, near miss, or threatened release involving ammonia, evacuate the immediate area and "

Area supervisor will contact the Operations Manager and the Maintenance Manager.  If both are not available (e.g. off-site), then the highest ranking supervisor on-site is contacted at the front office.  If needed, the Operations Manager and Maintenance Manager are contacted using pagers and/or telephone calls.\n\n\n\n3.    When the evacuation alarm sounds, all employees should follow the evacuation procedures and evacuate the plant to ensure their safety. Currently, the facility evacuates its employees by the use of an alarm system and personal communication.  It is the responsibility of the management and supervisory staff to notify all employees of the need to evacuate.\n\n\n\n4.    Call 911 to ensure public safety.  The Maintenance Manager or his designated alternate will evaluate the situation and determine appropriate response measures (e.g. use remote emergency switch to shut down equipment, clean up spills, etc.).\n\n\n\n5.    Notify the appropriate agencies as required by law.\n\n\n\n6.    Within 48 hours, a complete investigation must be performed.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis study was conducted in September 2010 to satisfy the requirements of the PSM and RMP regulations. The facility is continually improving upon documentation of policies and procedures associated with the ammonia refrigeration process as well as operator training.\n\n\n\nDATA ELEMENT NOTES\n\n\n\nItem number 7.15 (Contractor Evaluation) has been intentionally left blank.  This item has been developed for Kemps and will be implemented when required.  In addition, the Emergency Action Plan outlines notification procedures and reporting procedures in the event of an emergency, which could include fire, ammonia release, blackout, and power failure.\n\n"
