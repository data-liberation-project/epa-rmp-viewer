There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\nIn 1995, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plant using a consulting organization. A PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\no    Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\no     Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\no     Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management\n\no    Chlorine system maintenance procedures \n\no    Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\no    Conducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the three chlorine processes\n\no    Developing an initial Emergency Response Plan \n\no    Training in support of the certification of operators\n          \nThe plant superintendent and the company safety managers annually review and update procedures and activities to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations. Recent activities include RMP Self-Audits in late 2007 and RMP training in May 2009. \n\nIn addition to PSM compliance, the plant has implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and other chemicals.\n\n-The chlorine delivery system at the plant has been upgraded in 2003 to a new, more efficient vacuum process. \n\n-Plant inventories are continued to be controlled with a maximum of three cylinders on site\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. In 1999, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. The County LEPC and other local response organizat"

Chlorine Response Drills are routinely conducted.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. Hydro Management Services has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nAt the Wastewater Treatment Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n- Lockout/Tagged\n- Confined Space\n \nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an excellent safety record with no recordable injuries over the past three years. As mentioned earlier, there have no reportable chlorine releases from the plants in the last five years.  The plant has worked extensively to upgrade its safety program.
