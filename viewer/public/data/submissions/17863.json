      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.0  Introduction\nAlventia, Inc. is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Alventia, Inc. has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Alventia, Inc. and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Mangement Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Alventia, Inc.  This plan is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule (68.150 through 68.185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Alventia, Inc.\n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAlventia, Inc. is committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Alventia, Inc. implements reasonable control to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, Alventia, Inc. controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.\n\n3.0  Facility Process and Regulated Substances\nAlventia, Inc. manufactures vinylidene fluoride (VDF), which is listed in the RMP regulations as a flammable material. After production, liquified VDF is stored on site in two 16,100 gallon storage tanks.  The weight of VDF in each storage tank is approximately 120,000 lbs., which exceeds the RMP rule threshold quantity for VDF in a process (10,000 lbs.).  Because the VDF storage creates the potential for offsite consequences resulting from an accidental re"

      "SummaryText": "lease of VDF and the process is included in one of the 10 \"targeted\" NAICS codes, the process falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program.\n\n4.0  Offsite Consequence Analysis\nThe RMP rule requires Alventia, Inc. to perform an offsite consequence analysis for one worst-case and one alternative release scenario for VDF, a flammable substance.  The worst-case release scenario is the unlikely complete release of 120,000 lbs. of VDF from a failure of one of the 16,100-gallon storage tanks.  The released VDF is assumed to form a vapor cloud which subsequently explodes.  The endpoint distance corresponding to a 1 PSI overpressure is 0.2 miles.  Within this short distance there are no residences, nor are there any environmental receptors within this distance.  There are, however, a number of commercial operations within this distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for VDF is the release of the entire contents of a storage vessel when it contains a typical operating capacity of 50%, or 60,000 lbs. of VDF.  The released VDF forms a vapor cloud which subsequently explodes.  The endpoint distance corresponding to a 1 PSI overpressure is 0.1 miles.  Within this short distance there are no residences, nor are there any environmental receptors within this distance.  There are, however, a number of commercial operations within this distance.\n\n\n5.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe RMP rule requires a Program 3 prevention program for the VDF process. The following paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at Alventia, Inc. which apply to this process.\nSafety Information\nAlventia, Inc. maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the covered process.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Alventia, Inc., including VDF.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design bases and con"

Checklists include items to help ensure that Alventia, Inc. operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\nOperating Procedures\nAlventia, Inc. develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) train employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\nTraining\nAlventia, Inc. trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided, as necessary.\nMaintenance\nAlventia, Inc. properly maintains the process equipment.  The maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in the maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\nManagement of Change\nAlventia, Inc. has a program in place to document changes to the process.  A significant change in process chemicals, technology, equipment, practices or procedures prompt implementation of this program.  The program is designed to (1) evaluate the impact of the change on the process, (2) update records on the process and (3) ensure that workers are informed and trained on any changes.\nPre-Startup Review\nAlventia, Inc. performs audits on a new process or an existing process that has undergone a modification affecting the safety information.  This review is done prior to beginning operation.  The "

A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies are corrected in a timely manner.\nIncident Investigations\nAlventia, Inc. investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The company trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\nEmployee Participation\nAlventia, Inc. requires participation by the effected employees in development (1) of the process hazard evaluation, (2) process safety management, and (3) operating procedures of all covered processes.  The employees that work with or maintain the processes are given access to all information required under the rule.\nHot Work Permit\nAlventia, Inc. has written safety practices in place for fire protection and process operation.  A permitting system is used to prevent any unsafe acts on or around the covered process.\nContractors\nAlventia, Inc. reviews all contractors prior to working on or near a covered process.  The contractor must demonstrate that the work will be performed competently and safely.  The company will provide information on the hazards of the process and the safety practices in place.

This facility is set to begin operations following the development and implementation of the RMP.  No releases of regulated substances have occurred from Alventia, Inc. in that time that have resulted in consequences of interest (i.e. deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site).\n\n7.0  Emergency Response Program\nAlventia, Inc. has established a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plan regulations.  This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department.  Regular dialogue is maintained between the facility and the local response personnel, and the company provides appropriate information to the fire chief.  Alventia, Inc. periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local response authorities.\n\n8.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAlventia, Inc. constantly strives to improve the safety of the processes at the plant through both the incident investigation program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  At this time there are no planned safety improvements."
