      "SummaryText": "The City of Stamford, Texas (City) operates the Stamford Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) which is located in Jones County, Texas on the northeast side of the City.  The WWTP provides domestic wastewater treatment services to the City of Stamford.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the wastewater treatment plant where up to 4,000-pounds of chlorine (two one-ton cylinders) are stored on-site at any one time.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Stamford WWTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the City Manager is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include commitments to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WWTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.

      "SummaryText": "ed WWTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WWTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Stamford WWTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00a768.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews, and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (\u00a768.50 & \u00a768.58).\r\n\r\nThe Stamford WWTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR \u00a71910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The Stamford WWTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The Stamford WWTP operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via calling 9-1-1 in the event of a chlorine release from the Stamford WWTP.  The City of Stamford's Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the county-wide Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00a768.90(b))."
