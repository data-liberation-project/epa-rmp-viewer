The Hazardous Communication Program has been incorporated into the Risk Management Program to help evaluate the needs of our facility.  Informational training sessions with employees on response to an emergency has prepared them to respond in a safe manner.  Our facility is a wastewater treatment plant and the wastewater is chlorinated for disenfection.  One ton cylinders are used for this process and there are normally three to four cylinders stored on siteTwo cylinders are on line and theothers are stored inside waiting for use.  The worst case scenerio for this facility would be the release of a one ton cylinder.  There has never been a chlorine release that could not be routinely handled.  The employees at the treatment plant have been trained to respond to leaks and are knowledgable of the emrgency agencies to notify if a leak cannot be contained immediatly.  Environmental Management Corporation and the City of St. Charles will continue to monitor the chlorine process and take any measures to prevent an accidental release.  The safety of our employees and community is the number one priority."
