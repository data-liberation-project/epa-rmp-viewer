The facility is approxfmately 34years old and is located on approximately 5 acres.\n\n2.0      ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE     POLICY:\n\nRembrandt is committed to providing a safe workplace that is operated in an environmentally responsible manner.   Rembrandt is also committed, to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to safety in the workplace and the protection of the environment.\n\nIn section A6 of the RMP and Risk Management Program Rembrandt has an Emergency Response Plan which provides instructions and responsibilities required of all facility personnel in case of plant emergencies. The management team is committed safely and the implementation of safe procedures at the facility.\n\nRembrandt maintains a well trained and equipped staff of refrigerant mechanics, each of the refrigeration mechanics has a minimum of 6 years of experience with ammonia refrigeration systems. The Maintenance Manager is trained and designated as the facility incident Commander.   Appropriate personnel protective equipment including respirators and self-contained breathing apparatus f SOBS\") are available onsite for response for ammonia incidents.\n\n3.0      FACILITY OVER VIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe facility is focused on approximately 5 acres in Abbeville, Alabama.  The facility consists of several connected buildings with over 90,000 square feet under roof. Rembrandt produces and freezes egg products. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the facility process.  The operating capacity of the refrigeration system is between 24,000 and 30,000 pounds of ammonia. No other regulated substances (toxic or flammables) at the facility are stored or used at quantities which would require compliance with the Risk Management Program.\n\n4.0      SENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nRembrandt has reviewed a"

A management system has been established to maintain the elements of the PSM and Risk Management Programs. Applicable written elements of the PSM and the Risk Management Program are readily accessible by employees.  An automatic ammonia detection system (A?ADS\") provides reliable notification of .ammonia releases.\n\n5.0      FIVE: YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nRembrandt has not had an accident with the ammonia system.\n\n6.0      EMERGENCYRESPDNSE PROGRAM\n\nThe ammonia ref refrigeration system is covered by the Emergency Response Plan, If a release of ammonia Is detected by the ADS or by employees the procedures within this manual will be followed including notification of hazardous materials responders (refrigeration mechanics) and as required, the involvement of the incident commander.  The manual describes the level of personnel protective equipment to be used to respond to ammonia incidents. Facility-wide training regarding emergency procedures and evacuation routes occurs on an annual basis.\n\nRembrandt has conducted pre-emergency planning with the local fire department and the county LEPC. Rembrandt will work with these agencies as necessary to notify the public about an ammonia release. The manual also contains procedures for emergency alerting and response procedures for on-site personnel and off-site emergency contacts. Media relations will be handled by senior management\n\n7.0      PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nRembrandt is committed to continuous improvement and safe operation of its ammonia refrigeration system and is in the process of addressing corrective actions deemed necessary and as identified in the PHA. The facility mechanical integrity preventative maintenance procedures have recently been reviewed/revised and a new tracking system implemented."
