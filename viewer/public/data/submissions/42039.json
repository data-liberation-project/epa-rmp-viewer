The program is an extension of the procedures for preventing leaks and dealing with leaks if they should occur as detailed in the OSHA Process Safety Management PSM plan for dealing with hazards of ammonia in the refrigeration systems at the Pelican Seafoods plant.  The Risk Management Program extends the safety considerations of the PSM plan to locations beyond Pelican Seafoods?s property boundaries to the City of Pelican.\n\nThe Risk Management Program includes physical plant information, information on safety controls and alarms, routine and non-routine operating procedures, process hazard analysis, maintenance information, training records of plant operators, training of non-plant community response personnel, and an Emergency Response Plan.\n\nPelican Seafoods uses ammonia in the refrigeration system for the cold storage and seafood freezing operations at the plant.  The facility uses ammonia in two separate locations.  The crab plant building uses ammonia in a brine freezing system.  This facility contains an estimated 800 pounds of ammonia.  The major facility is the cold storage building, the ice plant, and the main refrigeration compressor room.  This refrigeration system consists of a high pressure receiver, a low pressure receiver, and two intermediate pressure receivers located in the main compressor room.  This building is connected with ammonia piping to a 3 story (70? x 120?) cold storage facility and a 3 story (20? x 72?) ice making/ice holding facility.\n\nThe main refrigeration system operates continuously.  There is never a time when all of the ammonia is returned to a central location, so it is difficult to determine exactly how much ammonia is contained in the refrigeration system.  Measurement of components and probable fill of the various parts of the system indicate the system probably contains between 20,000 and 25,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas wit"
