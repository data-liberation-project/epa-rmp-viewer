(Schaeffler) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Cheraw, South Carolina facility (Plant 1).  Schaeffler operations include the manufacture of roller bearings.  Plant 1 has been in operation for over 50 years providing quality products and approximately 1600 (Cheraw Campus) jobs to the local community.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nSchaeffler is committed to ensuring that all chemical processes are designed, installed, operated, and maintained in such a manner that the likelihood of a catastrophic release is minimized or eliminated.  Schaeffler is committed to the pro-active identification, evaluation, mitigation, or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in the process, procedures, or equipment. It is  the policy of Schaeffler to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and maintain compliance with safety, health and environmental regulations: 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA)and Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nSchaeffler uses propane in a process to heat treat metal parts.  The heat treat process occurs in a heated furnace with a carbon-rich, oxygen-deficient atmosphere.  Propane is used to provide the necessary atmosphere for the carbonization of the metal parts.  The propane system consists of one propane storage tank.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Schaeffler has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for propane using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is the rupture of the entire contents of the tank when filled to 100% capacity over"

      "SummaryText": " a 10-minute period.  Using the EPAs RMP*Comp program, the maximum distance to the overpressure endpoint extends off-site and includes public receptors.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed for propane by Schaeffler, taking into consideration the operation's 50 year experience.  The most likely release scenario identified by Schaeffler is a release caused by a pipe failure during loading of the propane tank.  For this scenario, the amount of propane released would be limited to the mass of propane in the pipe because of the excess flow valve installed on the tank. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe propane system is designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA 58-1998 to prevent and mitigate accidental releases of propane, Schaeffler has implemented several precautionary measures such as process/equipment controls, standard operating procedures, preventative maintenance programs, employee training and audit programs.  \n\n\n\nControls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of propane include mechanical check valves, automatic and manual shut-offs.  In addition, Schaeffler has trained personnel to respond to potential minor propane releases.\n\n\n\nSchaeffler has developed and incorporated safety measures and procedures into standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the propane system.  These safety procedures were developed by Schaeffler and are reviewed annually at meetings of process and procedure reviews and other training sessions.  Schaeffler encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of training sessions and safety committee meetings. Changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees following procedures established by Schaef"

      "SummaryText": "fler.\n\n\n\nSchaeffler understands that maintaining the propane system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Schaeffler has implemented a preventative maintenance program including a detailed inspection of the propane system. Preventative maintenance is scheduled quarterly for the heat treat process.\n\n\n\nTo ensure Schaeffler control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled reviews/inspections are performed on the heat treat process. Schaeffler conducts detailed compliance audits every three years that incorporates review of safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigation.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOver the last five years, Schaeffler has not experienced a reportable off-site release of propane causing any on-site death, injury or significant property damage, or known off-site death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nSchaeffler has established an Emergency Response Plan for the entire plant site.  The facilities' Emergency Response Plan will be modified as changes are made to any process that could affect emergency actions.  Schaeffler employees receive hands-on training on the types of emergencies and how to respond to an emergency incident."
