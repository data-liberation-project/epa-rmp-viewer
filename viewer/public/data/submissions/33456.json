      "SummaryText": "1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.10 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Atlas Logistics Retail Services Phoenix LLC (ATL) refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant. Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of ATL to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedure combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by 29 CFR 1919.119. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120. The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n- ATL stores and distributes refrigerated and non-refrigerated foods. Storage requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods. This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n- The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrati"

Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView 5 (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nATL complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.\n\nATL's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be review annually and updated as necessary by the ATL Refrigeration Supervisor.\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA). Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system. This minimize"

Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.\n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at ATL in the past five years.\n\n1.60 Emergency Response Program\n\nATL has a written Emergency Response Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It complies with the provisions of OSHA emergency Response regulations, 29 CFR 1910.120. The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been reviewed with the Tolleson Fire Department.\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at ATL and establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipments are in place:\n\n- Incident Command Center\n- Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n- Emergency Response Team\n- Safe Rooms, Evacuation Plans, and Assembly Points\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Tolleson Fire Department, including the Maricopa County HazMat Team. The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nAll ATL personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify pl"

All system components meet design specification in ANSI/IIAR, equipment, design, and installation of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems. All pressure vessels are built according to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, pressure vessels. Any upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time.\n\nAll ATL personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.
