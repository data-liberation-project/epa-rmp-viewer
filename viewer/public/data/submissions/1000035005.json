      "SummaryText": "The primary activity at Creekstone is the slaughtering of cattle and the processing of meat from the carcasses.  To aid in the quality of the process, Creekstone uses an ammonia refrigeration system for cooling and freezing products.  The refrigeration system supplies several rooms throughout the Facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is circulated through equipment in the Facility in a \"closed loop\" system to provide areas with temperature control from 40?F to -40?F.  Anhydrous ammonia is liquefied under pressure in the storage vessel which is located outside, on ground level, north of the utility building.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the system is 19,300 gallons (approximately 82,725 pounds).  Pounds of ammonia were determined based upon storage conditions at the Facility.\n\n\n\n9.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (40 CFR 68.155(a))\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is Creekstone's policy to notify the Arkansas City Fire Department or the Cowley County Sheriff's Office.  Creekstone's Health, Safety, and Environmental Program is committed to provide safe working conditions, and preventing accidents and damages to employees, the environment, and the general public.   \n\n\n\n9.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nThe Creekstone Facility, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, receives, stores, and distributes anhydrous ammonia through a refrigeration system used in the production of beef products.  The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is 82,725 pounds, stored in the 11,282-gallon High Pressure Receiver (HPR), one  1,940-gallon Recirculator -45?F, one 7,760-gallon Recirculator +20?F, one 2,395-gallon Recirculator -10?F, one 530-gallon Thermosyphon Receiver, evaporative condens"

Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nCreekstone maintains a separate written Emergency Action Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\n\n\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.  Creekstone inspects all refrigeration equipment, piping, valves, gauges, and pumps on a monthly basis, and documents the inspection results.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n9.4    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with anhydrous ammonia, Creekstone maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is reviewed as needed (not to exceed annually) and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\n9.5    Training\n\n\n\nCreekstone has an anhydrous ammonia operator safety training program in place to train employees involved in the anhydrous ammo"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nWhen outside contractors are required for maintenance and construction activities, those personnel are accompanied by Creekstone employees or are briefed by the area supervisor on the rules, regulations, and emergency procedures outlined in the Emergency Action Plan before initiating work.  Contractors use hot work permits, confined space permits, comply with lockout procedures, and use appropriate personal protective equipment when needed.  Contractors are briefed on the emergency alarm procedures and emergency rendezvous point.  Contractors must sign the visitor log.  The supervisor debriefs the contractor after each day.\n\n\n\n9.7    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nCreekstone conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions of the RMP rule are being implemented.
