In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurance, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nFailure of the control pressure receiver containing 6606 pounds of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 45% of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten minute release.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.4 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:  worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release; ind"

      "SummaryText": "ustry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks, alarms and the auto-dialing system in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\nFailure of a transfer hose during unloading resulting in a release of 1428# of ammonia over a time period of 10 minutes.  Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel .31 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  Transfer hose failure was chosen as the alternative release scenario because it is a temporary connection and constructed of materials other than steel.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:  emergency equipment such as an excess flow valve on the tank truck and valves to isolate the transfer hose; the facility accident prevention program in place at the facility including operating procedures to have personnel present at all times during unloading, and the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the faciltiy.\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plants (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility."
