      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Bayer Corporation Clayton, NC Plant complies with the guidelines published by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) for equipment specification and operating procedures and the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) for emergency response.  Bayer also complies with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for ammonia.  If an Emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Clayton Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond.\n\nStationary Source of Regulated Substances\n\nThe Bayer facility in Clayton, NC is part of Bayer's Pharmaceutical Division.  The Clayton Plant produces plasma therapies by a plasma fractionation process. Many of the process steps take place at temperatures below freezing, therefore ammonia refrigeration systems are needed to cool and/or freeze different steps throughout the process.\n\nThe Clayton facility is approximately 182 acres located 2 3/4 miles southwest of down town Clayton, NC. The main production facility is south of the railroad tracks, and the North Plant, where the main ammonia refrigeration facility is located, is on the north side of the railroad tracks.\n\nThe facility was inventoried to determine the amount of ammonia typically stored on-site, as well as the amount of ammonia that could be stored in each piece of process equipment.  The total system charge is 27,500 pounds.  The largest vessels in the system are the two (2) high-pressure receivers that are 11 feet long by 66 inches in diameter or approximately 262 cubic feet, which is equivalent to 10,451 pounds of ammonia. These vessels could be filled to 88% of their capacity by NFPA codes, although they are typically operated around 40% capacity, therefore the maximum quantity that would be in either vessel is 9,200 pounds, which is the quantity used in the worst case release calculations.  A failure at one of the vessels would not cause a failure of the other"

The high pressure receiver is contained within a building therefore the effects of passive mitigation were used in determining the maximum distance to endpoint.  Using the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration the distance to endpoint is a circle centered at the location of the North Plant, with a 1.0-mile radius equivalent to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe worst case impact zone contains residential homes with a population of 484 people (based upon the information contained in the 2000 census for Johnston County).  The public receptors located within the worst case impact zone are the Powhatan Church (0.4 miles), and a daycare center (0.7 miles).  One environmental receptor, an unnamed tributary of the Neuse River (0.2 miles), was located in the impact zone.\n\nFor the Alternative-Case Release Scenario, rupturing of a 1/2 pipe was used.  The machine room is equipped with an exhaust/water curtain system and an emergency dump system.  Therefore, passive and active mitigation systems were accounted for in estimating the distance to endpoint.  The impact zone encompassed a circle with a radius of 0.1 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the impact zone.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Bayer Clayton facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  First and most important, this facility is designed to promote prevention, both in the building itself, and the equipment used as part of the refrigeration process.  Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, e"

      "SummaryText": "quipment and procedures.  Audits are regularly conducted to determine if all safety provisions are being properly implemented.  We have a preventative maintenance program and maintenance schedule which includes regular maintenance of compressors, pumps, evaporators, condensers, control valves, ammonia detectors, and emergency response equipment.  Bayer promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia with prevention as our goal.  Bayer employees are encouraged to voice their views on accident prevention issues and to recommend possible changes because we believe that safety management and accident prevention requires a team effort.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Clayton facility has not had an accidental release involving ammonia greater than 100 pounds (reportable quantity) in the past five years.  Additionally the Clayton facility has not had any releases from vessels containing more than the 10,000 pounds (threshold quantity) of ammonia.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBayer has a written emergency response plan that is filed with the Johnston County LEPC.  The Clayton Emergency Response team receives training on firefighting, hazardous materials, and emergency medical treatment.  The emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  Bayer closely communicates with local and county response teams such as the Clayton Volunteer Fire Department, and the Johnston County LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased upon this review of the ammonia refrigeration system there are no planned changes to improve the safety at this time, however, Bayer is dedicated to continuous improvement and strives to achieve safety levels that equal or surpass the best in the industry."
