The USEPA considers this endpoint as the threshold for potential serious injury to people as a result of a short-term exposure to the methyl chloride vapors.\n\nUsing the USEPA guidance, and including, as set forth in the rule, consideration for the use of passive mitigation measures (containment by diking and evaporation control), the estimated distance to the endpoint from a worst case release of methyl chloride is 176 yards.  Zeeland Chemicals has implemented a passive vapor suppression system, which minimizes the potential impact zone under the worst case scenario.  Even under this worst case scenario there are no residences or sensitive off-site receptors such as schools, hospitals or nursing homes located within 176 yards of the storage tank.\n\nMethyl Chloride Alternate Release Scenario\n\nIn the alternate release scenario, it is assumed that a 1/4 inch diameter leak develops at a valve packing in the supply line near the methyl chloride storage tank.  Using EPA guidance tables for modeling this release, the endpoint is 0.82 ppm and results in an impact distance of less than 176 yards.  Through multiple levels of prevention and mitigation systems, such as monitoring devices, alarms, remote control valves, and trained on-site personnel, the leak would be detected and safely stopped.  Under this alternate scenario, there are no residences or sensitive off-site receptors such as schools, hospitals or nursing homes located within the distance noted.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nZeeland Chemicals believes strongly that all safety and environmental incidents are preventable.

In the unlikely event of an accidental release, Zeeland Chemicals is well prepared to manage such an incident and is confident that protecting employees, community residents, the environment, and plant facilities from personal injury or property damage will receive priority attention.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nIn accordance with guidance provided by the USEPA for determining the worst case scenario for the two regulated substances, ethylene and methyl chloride, Zeeland Chemicals must assume that the entire contents of the largest storage vessel will be released.  While this is considered as extremely unlikely, even by the USEPA, the rule does not allow facilities to take into account active mitigation systems and safe work practices that could prevent or limit the entire contents from releasing.  It is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked.\n\nAs a result, the mathematical models used to analyze the worst-case release scenario as defined in the rule will tend to overestimate the distance and area that would be impacted by an accidental release.  It should be noted, however, that the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered a public danger zone.\n\nIn addition to the worst case release scenario, USEPA also requires the identification and analysis of one alternate release scenario for each covered chemical, in our case ethylene and methyl chloride.  Zeeland Chemicals has appropriately used information from its process hazard analysis in selecting an alternate release scenario for each regulated substance.\n\nZeeland Chemicals continues to utilize specific systems (e.g., monitoring, detection, control, pressure relief, alarms, and active mitigation) in the design and operation of its processes that will likely limit a release or prevent a failure from occurring.\n\nHazard assessments and release scenarios for a hazardous substance are described"

This company operated at the Centennial Avenue location where Zeeland Chemicals, Inc. has now operated.  Chemical Specialties, Inc., a privately held company, owned and operated the plant from 1935 to 1947.  Miles Laboratories, Inc. owned and operated a unit at the same location from 1947 to 1977.  Hexcel Corporation owned and operated a division at the same location from 1977 to 1992.  \n\nZeeland Chemicals, Inc., a subsidiary of Cambrex Corporation, has owned and operated the manufacturing plant since 1992 and provides the pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries with the highest quality active ingredients, intermediates, chiral synthons, resolving agents, and services. Our facility is registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and we maintain systems for full compliance with the US FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) guidelines.  Today, Zeeland Chemicals sells approximately half of its products to customers for use as active ingredients or as intermediates and auxiliaries that are used to produce pharmaceutical products, such as antibiotics, cough suppressants, antifungal drugs, analgesics and protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV."

The program covers industrial facilities having more than a threshold quantity of certain specified hazardous or flammable chemicals.\n\nThe program focuses on chemical release prevention, detection, and accident response, and requires each facility to develop and implement a site-specific risk management plan including a hazards assessment, an accident prevention program and an emergency response plan.  The program requires facilities to review worst case release scenarios no matter how unlikely those scenarios may be, and identify ways to minimize impacts from such releases.\n\nThe Zeeland Chemicals, Inc. facility currently has two processes covered under this program.  The covered processes are as follows:\n7 On-site storage and usage of methyl chloride, which is a primary raw material in the manufacture of certain chlorinated quaternary ammonium compounds.\n7 On-site storage and usage of ethylene, a primary raw material in the manufacture of a co-polymer product which has final application in photographic film.\n\nZeeland Chemicals is committed to minimizing the risk of adverse impacts from its operations, and our commitment to responsible operations is built directly into our business objectives.  This commitment is manifested further in our use of sound operating and maintenance practices, use of safety-conscious designs as well as extensive employee training.  In addition, the performance of periodic safety audits and incident investigations are designed to review and minimize risks to employees, the environment, and the community.\n\nZeeland Chemicals continually strives to be an industry leader in environmental stewardship.

We continue to place our Sales and Marketing organizations as the focal point for customer contact on safety information, allowing them to focus internal resources to best assist customers.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nZeeland Chemicals has worked hard to ensure that our products and manufacturing operations meet or exceed industry standards of excellence for protecting both the community and the environment.  As a socially responsible company, we have set aggressive goals to continue improving our EH&S performance into the next decade.

The methyl chloride is stored in a bulk storage tank with a maximum capacity of 41,540 pounds.  The methyl chloride is directly connected to the production operations through a piping manifold.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nFor the last several years, Zeeland Chemicals has embraced the use of Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and What-If analyses in support of our periodic safety reviews of our chemical processing operations.  As part of our compliance effort with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and Michigan's Department of Labor (R325.18302) regulations, we have completed detailed reviews of our critical plant operations in order to assess their inherent safety readiness.  Similar to 112(r), these programs are specifically aimed at minimizing and/or eliminating the consequences of catastrophic releases.  This is done by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, employee training, and emergency response.\n\nKey to the success of these programs is the active involvement and participation of our employees in the completion of the process hazard analyses.  Our commitment to the use of the latest process hazard analysis techniques, detailed and accurate procedures and regular employee training, ensures that each critical safety component of our chemical processing operations is reviewed in detail.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nZeeland Chemicals is committed to conducting operations at the Zeeland facility in a safe and environmentally responsibl"
