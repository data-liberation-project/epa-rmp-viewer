Risk Management is the systematic identification, evaluation, and control of potential losses that may arise in an operation from future events such as toxic chemical releases.\n\nThe Risk Management Program should minimize the accidental releases of hazardous substances. Potential causes identified through the plan are as follows:\n\n7 Adequate operating or emergency procedures for plant personnel.\n7 Adequate training of operational and maintenance personnel.\n7 Identification of premature equipment failure due to inadequate maintenance, inspection.\n7 Equipment failure resulting from substandard materials.\n7 Process or equipment changes that could prove to be unsafe because of effects on safety systems.\n\nAccident History\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable release of a regulated substance.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe Treatment Plant has personnel on-site 16.5 hours/day, (0600 - 2330), 7 days/week the entire year. The Operator in responsible charge will be aware of the primary and alternate emergency coordinators in the emergency plan, as well as, all emergency procedures. The primary and alternate emergency coordinators are thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility emergency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of hazardous material, the location of all records within the facility and the facility layout.\n\n The Risk Management Manager ( or Alternate) is responsible for overseeing the response to"

The Risk Manager will assess the hazards of the emergency and contact state or local authorities when necessary. If response actions are needed, the Risk Manager will coordinate the emergency response team members. The Risk Manager is also responsible for documenting what actions were taken.\nThe Risk Management Manager will provide the effected LEPC's with a copy of the EAP and every update. The Risk Management Manager will arrange drills, or exercises from time to time with the LEPC to promote preparedness for effective response in the event of an accident.\n\nEmployees at the WTP are trained in the hazards of the chemicals. Employees have also been briefed on the physical characteristics (odor, color, etc) of the chemicals to aid in their recognition skills. If an employee discovers a leak or release of any size, they are instructed to notify a facility supervisor. If a supervisor is unavailable, the employee will contact the Risk Manager, or their alternate.\n\nPlanned Improvements\n\nThe Frankfort Electric & Water Plant Board continuously strives to reduce risk by review of available literature involving process control. As technology improves new mitigation or control equipment will be added to minimize risk factors."

The regulation also apply to an estimated 7,200 public and private water and wastewater treatment facilities that use significant quantities of chlorine or ammonia.\n\nThe rule was intended to lessen the number and severity of serious chemical accidents, such as the types that occurred in Bhopal, India (1984, 2,500 fatalities), and Pasadena, Texas (1989, 23 fatalities).  The EPA regulation applies to facilities that manufacture; process, use, or otherwise handle regulated extremely hazardous substances in quantities that exceed specified thresholds (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C).\n\nPurpose\n\n As a goal, the Frankfort Electric & Water Plant Board is dedicated to minimize or prevent damages to human health and the environment in the event of an unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous material within the perimeter of the Edwin Keith White Water Treatment Plant. \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant produces all the potable water for the City of Frankfort in Franklin County, and portions of Shelby, Scott, Anderson, and Woodford Counties. The plant is located on a 65 acre secured facility on Coffee Tree Road approximately 2 miles from downtown Frankfort. The major chemicals used in this process are chlorine, ammonia, 50% sodium hydroxide, hydrofluoslicic acid, ferric sulfate, cationic polymer, powered activated carbon, zinc orthophosphate and potassium permanganate.\n \nWorst Case Release Scenario(s) Chlorine & Ammonia\n\nThe following information provides worst-case distances to end points for the most common situations involved with chlorine and ammonia.
