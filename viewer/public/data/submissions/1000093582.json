      "SummaryText": "Gordon Food Service operates a food distribution facility in Aberdeen, MD. Like many food facilities, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use. Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.  Gordon Food Service is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus, codes and standards where appropriate. Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we have a Process Safety Management program to help us operate and maintain the system safely.  Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems. Our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing:\n\n-    Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n\n-    Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the design limits of the \n\n        refrigeration system so that our employees are fully informed.\n\n-    Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and \n\n        safeguards and to identify appropriate changes to improve safety.\n\n-    Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the \n\n        refrigeration equipment.\n\n-    Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and \n\n        preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n-    Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\n-    Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeratio"

The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is prescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the likelihood or \"risk\" of these incidents.  The \"worst-case\" release scenario involves loss of the contents of the the largest vessel (HPR in machine room) over ten minutes.  As required, this scenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 200 ppm ammonia is reached beyond the property line.\n\nThe \"alternative\" scenario involves the function of a pressure relief valve, a safety device intended to prevent overpressure in our system.
