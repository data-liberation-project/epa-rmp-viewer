Mobile Plant is located in the Theodore Industrial Park in Theodore, Alabama on a 1,000 acre site shared with Creanova, Inc. This facility employs 30 personnel. Seven production areas produce 12 products in a continuous production schedule, operating 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: dimethyldichlorosilane, hydrogen chloride, methyltrichlorosilane, acetylene, trichlorosilane, ethylenediamine, hydrogen sulfide, trimethylchlorosilane and ethyl ether.\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with substances in Program 3 processes at the site is a catastrophic failure of one storage tank containing 190,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride over a 10-minute period forming a vapor cloud. Administrative procedures and equipment interlocks prevent the chlorine storage tank fr"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. According to EPA's look-up tables, the release would reach offsite endpoints such as public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the site is a catastrophic failure of one tank trailer containing 10,000 pounds of acetylene over a 10-minute period forming a vapor cloud which subsequently explodes. Administrative procedures and equipment interlocks prevent the acetylene tank trailer from containing over this amount. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. According to EPA's look-up tables, the 1 psi overpressure boundary from the explosion would not reach offsite and would not reach any public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe ARS for dimethyldichlorosilane is from a hole in a transfer hose while transferring dimethyldichlorosilane from a tank trailer to a stationary trailer. The hole could release of 720 pounds of gas over a 3 minute period.  The 3-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary to detect the leak, close the emergency shut-off valve and deluge the vapors with fire water to control the vapor release.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. This release has the potential to reach offsite but the only public or environmental receptors reached above the toxic endpoint defined by EPA would be the adjacent industrial plant.\n\nThe ARS for hydrogen chloride is from a failure in the flex hose on the hydrogen chloride weigh tank. The hose could release 4,000 pounds over a 10-minute period.  The 10-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary for the tank to empt"

This release has the potential to reach offsite and reach public or environmental receptors above the endpoint defined by EPA.\n\nThe ARS for hydrogen sulfide is from a failure in the piping from the storage tank trailer to the process weigh tank. The hole could release 530 pounds over a 2 minute period.  The 2-minute release duration is the approximate time until the excess flow valve on the storage tank trailer stops the flow.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. This release has the potential to reach offsite but the only public or environmental receptors reached above the toxic endpoint defined by EPA would be the adjacent industrial plant.\n\nThe ARS for ethylenediamine is from a leak in the discharge of a storage tank. The hole could release 6,8000 pounds over a 30 minute period. The 30-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary to detect the leak and shutdown the storage tank pump. No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. This release does not have the potential to reach offsite above the endpoint defined by EPA.\n\nThe ARS for methyltrichlorosilane is from a hole in the unloading hose during the transfer from a tank trailer to a storage railroad car. The hole could release 6,000 pounds over a 20-minute period.  The 20-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary to detect the leak, depressurize the line and thus stop the release.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. This release has the potential to reach offsite and reach public or environmental receptors above the endpoint defined by EPA.\n\nThe ARS for trimethylchlorosilane is from a hole in the unloading hose during the transfer from a tank trailer to a storage tank.
