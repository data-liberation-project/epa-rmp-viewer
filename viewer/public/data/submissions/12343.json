If inspection reveals a weak point in the material or process, Frontier corrects the problem consistent with PSM and implements, if necessary a change in the process operations and procedures to address the weakness.  \n\nIn the event that equipment fails, Frontier has installed process and chemical specific detection and monitoring equipment.   These detectors alert facility personnel if a release has occurred.   Frontier operational personnel participate in comprehensive and frequent process training to insure that releases are responded to expeditiously and in a manner that minimizes the potential for injuries or exposure to facility or adjacent population.

The Cheyenne Refinery processes approximately 40,000 barrels of crude oil per day.   The crude oil is supplied from oil producers in Wyoming and adjacent states.  Frontier Refining Inc. is proud of its Cheyenne Refinery and the two hundred and sixty well trained employees who operate and maintain the facility.  The refinery has been part of the Cheyenne community for over sixty-five years and is a major contributor to Wyoming's and Cheyenne's economy.\n\nFrontier's safety performance has been recognized by the National Petroleum Refining Association with three Gold Awards and two Meritorious Performance Awards in the last five years.  Frontier is committed to the safety of its employees and the community.\n\nFrontier's Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nFrontier's concern with the safety of the facility is evidenced by the extensive commitment to policy and procedure development and the commitment of personnel and resources to safety related training.  Frontier's commitment to prevention and response is further evidenced by Frontier's participation with local emergency planning committees.  Frontier provides each employee an average of 30 hours per year of training on safe work practices and emergency procedures.  Frontier requires that all employees attend a formal safety meeting once per month.  Frontier has  developed and implemented over 600 written, detailed operating procedures available 24 hours per day to the facility personnel.  These procedures address release prevention and release emergency response activities.  These procedures have become  policy at the Frontier facility\n\nFrontier's release prevention program is based on three primary components.  Those components are comprised of the util"

The scenario selected assumes an instantaneous release of the entire volume contained in the mixer/settler tank.  The release would occur over a ten minute period.   Active mitigation of the release would occur by the facilities HF Water Deluge System within four minutes of the release occurring. The deluge system places a water flow of up to 6,000 gallons per minute onto the release site.\n\nSuch a release scenario hypothetically would cause an offsite impact.  Frontier utilized the EPA's RMP*Comp worst case release model to evaluate this scenario.   The RMP*Comp model indicated that the toxic endpoint for HF would be reached 14 miles from the facility.  This calculation is very conservative.  It assumes the HF plume is neutrally buoyant, released during in a low wind speed and a stable atmospheric condition.\n\nFlammables Worst Case Release Scenario:    The worst case flammables release scenario is the rupture, vaporization and ignition of the total volume of butane, 1,040,000 pounds, in the facilities Horton Sphere.  RMP*Comp for this scenario yielded a distance to the overpressure endpoint of 0.8 miles from the sphere.  This would result in an offsite impact.  \nThe rupture of the Horton Sphere containing liquidized gas under pressure, in reality, would result in only a faction of the sphere contents being volatilized through flash vaporization.  The fraction would rapidly cool to the boiling point of the liquid either remain in the sphere or spill to the ground.  This remaining liquid may catch on fire, but would likely not be involved in the generation of the overpressure wave.\n\nToxics and Flammables Alternative Case Release Scenarios for the Facility\nToxics Alternative Case Release Scenario:    Chlorine\nFrontier uses chlorine to treat cooling process water.

In this scenario, the Water Deluge System (up to 6000 gallons per minute of water) would be activated within 4 minutes of the release.  The scenario assumes a release of 15,976 pounds of HF for 60 minutes.  The initial release rate is 8,100 pounds per minute of HF, decreasing due to tank pressure drops, to an average of 69 pounds per minute for the 60 minutes of the release.   RMP*Comp predicts a toxic endpoint is reached 0.4 miles from the release site.
