The program is updated as needed.  All required elements are addressed by Management in a timely manner.  Standard Operating Procedures have been developedby the Maintenance Manager/Engineer and are certified annually.  Each piece of ammonia equipment is inspected by IIARs Mechanical Integrity Inspections forms.  In order to keep an accurate record of the history of the PSM/RMP program, IdaCold utilizes SafeTrax.  An online program that is accessed by a secure username and password (per authorized employee) that houses all documentation.  \n\nIdaCold recognizes that Safety is paramount to the success of its business.  Safety of employees and facility are first in Management's statement.  \n\nIdaCold continues to update and address items pertinent to their programs and know that by addressing these issues will only make their programs better and successful.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     IdaCold LLC recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and continue to be the responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n     The IdaCold LLC PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and  integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the fileing date has passed.\n\n     IdaCold LLC believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Maintenance Engineer has been involved with the development and implementation of the PSM and RMP program.  The Maintenance Engineer assumes the major responsibility for operating the facility in a safe manner. \n     The IdaCold LLC Emergency Action Plan has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Nampa Fire Department.  \n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     IdaCold LLC is a Public Refrigerated Warehouse.  The refrigeration system utilizes anhydrous ammonia to run the refrigeration system.  \n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     The worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of the High Pressure Receive.  The ammonia would be released over a 10 minute period.  The distance the ammonia would travel under worst case weather conditions was calculated.     A WORST CASE release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the release prevention and mitigation features incorporated in the PSM/RMP program and ammonia equipment, as well as the experience of a trained Maintenance Engineer.\n\n     "

      "SummaryText": "The alternative release scenario was conducted and determined to have a minimal impact on the facility and enviroment with the engineering and administrative controls that have been placed within the system as well as the expertise and training the Maintenance Manager has.  \n\n\nIV.   DESCRIPTION OF THE IDACOLD LLC ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIdaCold LLC considers the PSM/RMP programs to be \"living\" documents that are updated and revised as needed to maintain their viability.\n\n     IdaCold LLC emphasizes and insists on  \"employee participation\" from the Maintenance manager in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of the PSM/RMP program.  He is and has been involved in each aspect of the program and has been an intricate part of a successful program.  \n\n     IdaCold LLC maintains a pro-active \"open-door\" policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  \n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no reportable releases of ammonia at IdaCold LLC that resulted in an injury, or that have had an off-site impact, or that have resulted in significant property damage to either on-site or off-site receptors.\n\nVI.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     IdaCold Employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia release in a defensive fashion.  The site Emergency Action Plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Nampa Fire Department.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      IdaCold LLC recognizes that (even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program may need improvement as their company grows. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that require  attention, development, and revision as needed. This is demonstrated by addressing safety issues as they are made aware.  Continued improvement of SOPs during the certification process, ensuring that all equipment i"
