Information includes\ninformation pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, process technology, process equipment, and\nemergency response procedures.\n\nThe stationary source is the CARGILL AgHorizions anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer\nfacility.  The facility has two stationary storage tanks with combined  capacity of 24,000 water\ngallons (112,000 pounds).  The facility also stores numerous smaller transportable tanks (nurse\ntanks) that are actually used in the fertilizer application process.         \n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per 40 CFR 68.165(a)(2) to\ndetermine program applicability.  CARGILL has chosen to use the DEGADIS+\nto determine offsite impacts.\nWorst-Case Scenario Parameters\n     1.   Land Use - Rural\n     2.   Release Qty - 112,000 lb \n     3.

Release Duration - 10 min\n\nFor this facility, a worst-case release would occur in the event that a primary ammonia tank\nwould rupture and the entire contents would be released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  The\nworst-case scenario requires a ground-level release height (0 feet).  Release calculations are\npresented below:\n          \nSample Endpoint Calculation\n          \nGiven:         The Combined Tank Capacity is 24,000 water gallons\n                    ANSI K61.1 filling density = 56 % (of water wt.)\n                              \nRelease Rate   = Tank Capacity / 10 minutes\n          = (24,000 gal * 8.345 lb/gal water)*(0.56)  / 10 min \n          = (200,280 lb)*(0.56) / 10 min\n          = 112,000 (rounded) / 10 min\n          = 11,200 lb/min\n \nInput of the preceding data into DEGADIS+ Comp program, the results indicate a worst-case\nimpact of 2.1 miles for the facility.

Alternative release parameters are presented below:\nAlternative Scenario Parameters                \n           \n    1.   Land Use - Rural                 \n    2.

Release Duration - 10 min\n      \nThe alternative scenario chosen for this facility involves a release because of a\nsudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this scenario is still unlikely because\nthe transfer hoses used have multiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless\nsteel wire underneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it is\nmore likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  This scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor line to the tank\ntruck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture area is assumed at 0.5 square\ninches.  Because personnel are always present at the facility during transfer, CARGILL\npersonnel will respond within 10 minutes.  Release rate was calculated using \nthe OCAG tank release equation (Section 8.1.1).             \n        \nInput of the preceding data into DAGADIS+ revealed an alternative release scenario impact \nof 0.23 miles for the facility. There are no residences located within 0.23 miles from the facility. \nIn fact, the closest residence is located approximately 0.4 miles away.  The amount of ammonia\nthat would have to be released to reach this residence is as unlikely as the worst-case scenario. \nThus, this alternative release scenario satisfies the conditions of \u001568.28.
