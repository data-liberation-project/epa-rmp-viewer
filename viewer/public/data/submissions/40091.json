MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (a)(I) \nInChem Corp. has a management system in place which is lead by InChem\u00bfs President, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with plant specific policies, eliminates and or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant. \n1.1.2. PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (a)(2) \nInChem Corp. maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to the entire facility plus RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in the plants OSHA PSM program.\n1.2. INCHEM CORP. SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE ROCK HILL SITE (b) \nInChem Corp. employs 65 full-time employees engaged in plant and administrative operations.  Epichlorohydrin and Hydrogen sulfide are used in the plant\u00bfs operations.  Since our last RMP Submital in 1999 we have eliminated Methylene Chloride from our inventory of chemicals used on site.  This is also reveiwed in section 1.7 Changes to Imporve Safety.\n\n1.2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION (b )(1) \nThe site is owned and operated by InChem Corp.  The site is located at 800 Cel-River Rd., Rock Hill, SC  29730.  The site is boardered by Cherry Road on the west, Cel-River Rd. on the South, Hoechst Celanese Cel-River Plant on the North and Eden Terrace"

In addition, the facility also stores up to 24 portable hydrogen sulfide cylinders and a specially designed charging system.  The boundaries of the systems subject to the RMP regulation include the Epichlorohydrin Bulk Storage Tank and Hydrogen Sulfide storage and process feed system.\n\nThese are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n1.2.2. REGULATED SUBSTANCES (b)(2) \nEpichlorohydrin and Hydrogen Sulfide are the primary regulated substances on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  Epichlorohydrin is received and storaged in a 240,000 gallon storage tank.  It is an EPA and OSHA Listed toxic Chemical.  It is posionourf, may be fatal if inhaled, and a suspected carcenogen.  Epichlorohydrin has an OSHA permissible exposure level of 2 ppm.  It is flammable with a flash point of 88 degree F.                                                                                                                                                                     The Hydrogen Sulfide process was installed as part of the process for manufacturing a proprietary silane.  It operates under permit from the State of South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC).  The hydrogen sulfide is received in pressurized containers, stored on site and distributed to a single process control system.\nHydrogen Sulfide is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant, flammable and it is corrosive.  Hydrogen sulfide is gas with the formula H2S.  It is a It has a 20 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and an OSHA WTA of 10 ppm and an NFPA health rating of 4; with acute health hazards and fire hazards.\n1.3.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d) \nInChem\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used.  It is part of the plants operating culture.\n1.4.1. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d)(I) \nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. The overviews of these programs are listed below: \nInChem has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \nThe DMS, document maintenance system, is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control. \nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used. \nMaintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations, making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment. \n\nIncident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure we learn from each event as well as correct the causes of the incident. \nEmployees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed below under emergency response. \nSafe work practices are used throughout the facility including: 1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lock Out Tag Out. Permits, 3) Vessel Entry Permits, 4) Site Security, and 5) Breaking Into Chemical lines. \nContractors must meet InChem\u00bfs high safety and technical standards as part of selection and ongoing evaluations.  Plus, InChem demands training of contractors to our standards. \n1.4.2. Hydrogen Sulfide Specific Response Plan (d) (2) \n1.4.2.1.Hydrogen sulfide Specific Policies and Procedures \nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include:  the policies and procedures listed above and those of the hydrogen sulfide specific program. These include: \nSpecific procedures for the operation of the hydrogen sulfide process"

These materials are steel or hydrogen sulfide compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by hydrogen sulfide) rated to 800 psig. The maximum pressure of the hydrogen sulfide in the high-pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 5 to 1 safety factor.  There are hydrogen sulfide monitors, which detect the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the storage area, transfer area and production areas.  The alarms and lights in the plant alert employees of a potential hydrogen sulfide leak.\n1.5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (e) \nInChem Corp. has had no accidental releases of hydrogen sulfide in the past five years per EPA 40 CFR 67.42 (a). \n1.6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (1) \nEmergency response procedures are contained in the InChem Corp. Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site-specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the senior staff.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\nBesides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the preventio"

The plan includes training of all plant operators.  The primary response team includes the local fire department and rescue, plus the HazMat Team (all off site).  All of these respond to severe leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.\n1.6.1. PERSONNEL (f)(I) \nPersonnel are the key resource of InChem\u00bfs prevention program.  Our employees make up the operators and incident commanders.  InChem Corp. fosters a high level of involvement in every aspect of the hydrogen sulfide system operations including participation in:\nSafety teams,\nDevelopment of the operation procedures,\nHazard evaluations, and,\non-going training of the operators and other involved staff.\n1.7. CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (g) \nThe most important change was elimination of Methylene Chloride on site.  The units have been emptied and cleaned.  Other changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in the May, 2004, internal safety HazOp, tour, and audit of the PSM program.  These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implementation is underway.  An Audit was conducted to review the PSM and RMP programs.\nInChem Corp. continually reviews implemented and potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the InChem Corp. management team and process safety team are reviewing potential upgrades to the existing design of the operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of hydrogen sulfide."
