Stepan Company is a leading merchant producer of surfactants that are the key ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning compounds. Manufacturers of detergents, shampoos, lotions, toothpastes, and cosmetics depend on surfactants to achieve the foaming and cleaning qualities of their products. Stepan Company's Pasadena Plant handles two (2) substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the regulation.\n\nPasadena utilizes ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, which are classified as toxic in the RMP Rule.\n\nEthylene oxide (EO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the alkoxylation process. The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers or used as a raw material for other Stepan sites. Ethylene oxide is classified as a toxic gas in the RMP Rule.\n\nPropylene oxide (PO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the alkoxylation process. The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers or used as a raw material for other Stepan sites. Propylene oxide is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule.\n\nThe storage of ethylene oxide propylene oxide railcars within a secure location occurs when the cars are not ready to unload. The area has a separate emergency access road and can be monitored via camera.\n\nAs a result of the use of regulated substances at Stepan Company's Pasadena Plant, the above processes are covered by the RMP rule. The inventory of the substances varies during the year. The Maximum Expected Inventory for each regulated substance is registered within this submission.\n\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Stepan Company's Pasadena Plant.
