Refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic).  No releases or accidents, involving anhydrous ammonia, that are reportable in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP Rule), have occurred at this facility.\n\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS)\nThe low temperature recirculator contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst-case basis.  This vessle is typically maintained at approximately 30%, which is equivalent to approximately 6781 pounds of liquid anhydrpus ammonia.  A WCS assumes that the tank's contents are released over a 10-minute period or 678 lbs. per minute.  EPA RMP Ammonia Guidance Document Endpoint Tables predict, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmosphericstability Class F, the ammonia release may travel 1.5 miles from the point of release.  It is estimated that approximately 2700 people may be affected in the surrounding community and highway.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario (ACS)\nThe alternate case, more likely, release scenario was selectyed to involve a 3/4-inch relief valve lifting a 250 psig.  Anhydrous ammonia (at approximatley 250 psi and 113 F) was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 0.75 inches) of approximately 92 lbs./min., determined from an ammonia gas release table.  It is estimated that the release valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators on site, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 920 lbs.  The EPA RMP Ammonia Guidance Document Endpoint Tables predicted with a wind speed of 6.7 mph and atmospheric stability Class D, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.2 miles.

There is a major highway and a public rest stop, as well as adjacent business within the radius to the toxic end point.\n\nFuture plans to improve the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at Southeast Frozen Foods consist of developing and coordinatingan emergency response plan with the Calhoun County Office of Emergency Management.  Other plans include annual operator refresher training, hazardous materials technician and incident commander training, and refrigeration process safety management program inspection audit annually."
