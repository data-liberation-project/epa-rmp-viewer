      "SummaryText": "Revision 8.1 Executive Summary\n\nSacramento Regional CSD (District), has instituted a Risk Management Program (RMP) for the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (SRWTP), as required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68. The RMP identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with any Regulated Substance (RS) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities. The program describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees.  The program also describes offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis, defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of RS accidental releases, and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for auditing of program elements and implementation of mitigation measures.  The previous RMP 5 year update was filed in April 2014 as required by ARP regulations.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe SRWTP treats wastewater collected from the City and County of Sacramento, from the Cities of Folsom, West Sacramento (Yolo County), Elk Grove, Rancho Cordova, and Citrus Heights.  It is located at 8521 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA on 900 acres of a 3,400-acre site between Interstate 5 and Franklin Blvd., south of Meadowview Rd. The remaining 2,500 acres serve as a buffer between the Plant and nearby residential areas. There are approximately 340 full-time employees at this site and daily contractor and part time employees. The Plant treats 145 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) on average. The Plant currently uses chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for de-chlorination but will transition to the liquid form of these chemicals by late 2016. The Plant maintains quantities of these RS's greater than the Federal/State thres"

In anticipation of a potential interruption in rail service expected by January 1, 2016 due to Positive Train Control (PTC) federal requirements, the SRWTP is increasing disinfection and de-chlorination RS inventory. An administrative control will be implemented to store no more than 36 railcars on site. This increased chemical stock is to ensure sufficient product to continue the disinfection process for an extended period of time should rail service be interrupted. Additionally, methane gas is held in the digester gas system in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity. \n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems consist of railcar receiving, liquid chemical withdrawal from railcars, liquid chemical vaporization, and gaseous chemical metering and dissolving into water for ultimate application at various points in the wastewater treatment process. \n\nSolids removed in the wastewater treatment process are introduced into the  anaerobic digesters at the Plant. Gas consisting of approximately two-thirds methane is produced in the digesters through anaerobic digestion. The digester gas is scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants, stored in low pressure gas holders, and piped to a cogeneration plant where it is used to generate electricity and steam.  Digester gas that cannot be used by the cogeneration plant is flared or optionally used as a fuel source for on site boilers. Most methane is consumed shortly after it is collected; however, the entire potential stored inventory of digester gas in the plant must be considered for the purpose of comparison with the Federal threshold quantity. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nIt is the policy of the SRWTP that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and methane be done in a manner that meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases to protect the health and safety of its wor"

To accomplish this goal, the SRWTP has safety information on chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and methane, the processes, and RS equipment and procedures; performed  and revalidated a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed and revalidated an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established  written emergency response program coordinated with local emergency response agencies. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs that have been implemented by the SRWTP are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, engineering controls, and emergency response programs. \n\nThe SRWTP has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program that meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 which is the general accidental release prevention program.  A Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) is used as a management tool for the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS \n\nMany steps to prevent releases of an RS have been identified and implemented since the original RMP submittal.   These include, among other things, use of a gas scrubber system for the chemical building and Plant Emergency Trip Systems (PETs) to effectively isolate the system during an emergency which limits the amount of RS that may be released from the chemical and gas management areas. There are also redundant processes and isolation points in the chemical and gas management systems, and numerous facility-specific operational procedures for the chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and digester gas systems.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine, sulfur dioxide, or methane at this facility within the past five years re"

Furthermore, the Gas Managment emergency response program was revised in 2012-13 and the chemical handling system emergency response program was revised August of 2015 in close coordination with Cosumnes Fire and Sacramento City Fire Hazmat Departments. The SRWTP maintains and is in the process of enhancing its First Responder capability with respect to releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide by implementing use of enhanced Level B PPE.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nSRWTP staff continuously strives towards improvements and mitigation measures in the covered process areas. The Management of Change/Pre-Start Up Safety Review (MOC/PSSR) program has been updated and is utilized for change approvals prior to implementation. The Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been implemented in all three covered processes and continues to develop.   All improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analyses or compliance audits, which have been committed to accomplish, have been completed or are in progress.  Level B personal protective equipment response capability for the Chemical Response Team has been implemented to provide chemical responders increased response capabilities.  Planned safety changes include projects such as adding, re-evaluation of digester gas system operation to reduce the likelihood of gas venting, continuing re-design of all digester overflow systems, and phase out of the sulfur dioxide and chlorine systems through the EchoWater Project.
