Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices:\nTo insure safe operation and to prevent releases at Tyson Foods' Sherman, TX facility, the plant has implemented Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119 (PSM).  All operators of the ammonia refrigeration system are trained on the PSM program and receive operator training specific to the facility's refrigeration system.\n\nTo insure proper and effective responses to emergency situations this facility has implemented emergency action plans as required by OSHA's PSM rule.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\nPork and Beef further processing facility\nRegulated Substance(s): Anhydrous Ammonia, i.e. NH3\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThis facility complies with OSHA's PSM program and with Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP).  Tyson Foods also has adopted recommended installation, system operation and maintenance guidelines published by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) for our facility refrigeration systems.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History:\nOne incident involving the overpressurazation of the Chester Jensen water Chiller.  Process controls and training were change to prevent reoccurance.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program:\nA fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site.  This team is trained to the level of a Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120(q).  The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement and containment operations) required to remediate an incident.\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with outside agencies, personnel roles and lines of incident command authority, facility hazard analysis and emergency prevention, safe distances and places of re"

All Sherman, TX HAZMAT team members are initially trained 24 hours to the Technician level and to be followed by eight to 24 hours of refresher training per year under the direction of the on-site HAZMAT Instructor at the facility.  Each HAZMAT Instructor receives an initial 40 hours of training and then eight to hours per year of re-certification training that takes the instructor to the Incident Commander (I.C.) level of HAZMAT training.\n\nThe training is designed to teach both theory and hands-on training, thus giving the person an overall understanding of the nature of hazardous materials and the ability to assess and safely respond to the incidents in the Incident Command structure.  Technician level training includes but is not limited to the following:\n*Knowledge of basic hazards and risk assessment techniques\n*Proper selection and use of appropriate and required PPE for the chemical hazard\n*Terminology associated with HAZMAT\n*Advanced site control/security procedures\n*Advanced Containment/Control/Decontamination procedures\n*Use of atmospheric monitoring equipment and containment test procedures\n*Incident Command Structure Roles and Line of Authority\n*Interaction with local and state officials\n*Standard operating procedures for clean-up and termination\n*Critique\n\nAll training materials, hands-on drills and response procedures have been developed under the direction of Tyson's corporate Environmental Health and Safety department.\n\nAll Tyson team members are taught in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or lead-person immediately.
