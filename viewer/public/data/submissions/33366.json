      "SummaryText": "Veolia Water North America Operating Services operates the H. C. Morgan Pollution Control Treatment plant for the city of Auburn(owner).  The facility is an activated sludge/extended aeration sanitary wastewater treatment operation that is located on the southwest side of the City at 616 Sandhill Road.  The site is approximately 40 acres located in a rural setting (bounded by low density residental units).  The site is approximately 450 feet above sea level and the natural flow of surface water appears to be to the South toward Parkinson Mill Creek, a tributary of Chewalca Creek. The Facility treats the majority percentage of the sanitary wastewater for the City.  The site is regulated under the State of Alabama NPDES Permit #AL0050237.  The process utilizes both mechanical and biological treatment to remove organics from the wastewater, prior to returning the treated water to the environment.  Part of the process uses chlorine gas in contact with the treated water for disinfection.  The chlorine gas is stored and is placed into service in a chlorine contact building, which is isolated from the remainder of the plant.  Also, in the building there are no more than two cylinders in proximity to one another.  Operators are thoroughly trained in the handling of the chlorine.  A review of the process indicates that the worst case scenario is the release of a one ton cylinder that is being placed into service, plus a small amount of a second cylinder that is in service.  The release would allow gaseous chlorine to migrate off plant site to the south-southwest, toward some distant farm residents.  The enelope of expansion would be some 1.1 miles.  The most likely alternative scenario is the release of a partially full cylinder, with the same flow pattern and traveling some 773 yards in the same general direction.  In either case, the emergency response would involve activation of the local Emergency Response Program.  The site has a Process Safety Management (OSHA) program"

These programs are utilized for the entire plant operatio and for the specific chemical chlorine.  No incidents have occurred within the past five years.  Should an incident occur the site has developed an emergency response program that involves the public safety department (fire & police), the Local HAZMAT team and other support agencies.  In the future the program will be maintained to ensure protection of the local population and environment.  New technology is being considered which would allow the plant to discontinue the storage of chlorine."
