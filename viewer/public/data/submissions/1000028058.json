      "SummaryText": "The City of Bucyrus Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is committed to minimizing the risk to employees and to the public of injury or death from an accidental release of chlorine.  Chlorine gas is the only regulated substance at the WTP and is used for disinfection of the City's water supply.  The chlorine gas is dissolved in water (through a chlorinator) to form the disinfection agent liquid chlorine.  The maximum amount of chlorine in this process at any one time is 4000 pounds.  This represents two full one-ton cylinders being connected simultaneously.  This amount exceeds the threshold for EPA's Risk Management Planning of 2500 pounds.  The Bucyrus WTP is covered by OSHA PSM standards and therefore is subject to risk management program level 3.\r\n\r\nThe City of Bucyrus WTP maintains up-to-date accurate, written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for chlorine process.  These operating procedures are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the systems and preventing accidental releases.  An equipment failure could also result in an accidental release.  The WTP has a maintenance program that is also critical to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of the process equipment. The Plant Superintendent ensures that all chlorine process safety information is kept up-to-date, and maintained in a format that provides easy access for employees.\r\n\r\nThe WTP Superintendent ensures that all operators have the required training to properly and safely operate the chlorine process.  All new employees must complete at least 8 hours of initial training, which consists of chlorine specific safety and health hazards, process operations, and emergency operations including shutdown. Each employee must also complete at least 4 hours of refresher training every three years.  The refresher training covers a review of all topics presented in the initial training, as well as any changes to the chlorine process or equipment. Written examinations are given to employees' prof"

The overall purpose is to prevent or minimize the effects of a release.  The PHA is conducted on the entire chlorine system.  The Plant Superintendent updates the PHA at least once every five years, or when a major change occurs in the process.\r\n\r\nA chlorine gas leak to the atmosphere is the primary hazard associated with this process.  The worst case scenario would be represented by the complete failure (rupture) of a one-ton cylinder outside of the chlorine room, releasing 2000 pounds of chlorine into the air.  Using EPA's guidance criteria, this release is calculated to take place over 10 minutes. At a wind speed of 3.4 mph, the chlorine would travel 1.3 miles before the concentration drops below toxic endpoint, the level at  which chlorine gas is no longer a hazard to the public.  Depending upon the wind direction, such a release could affect almost anyone within the city and surrounding area.  The population within a 1.3 mile radius of the WTP was estimated to be just over 10,030 people.  This was determined using the Landview computer software developed by the EPA and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).\r\n\r\nNumerous alternate release scenarios resulting from the failure of valves or broken piping were considered.  Different variables were used in evaluating each different situation.  These include the  of opening, pressure and release duration.  The alternate release scenario chosen represents a more plausible possibility than the loss of a complete cylinder.  This situation involves the failure or damage of the fusible plug on the chlorine tank.  This would allow chlorine gas to escape uncontrolled from the hole for an estimated time of one hour.  This type of release would occur within the chlorine room of the water plant, which would provide"

At a wind speed of 6.7mph, the chlorine gas would travel less than 0.1 miles before the concentration drops below the toxic endpoint.  Those affected by such a release would be the residents near the WTP.  The population within a 0.1 mile radius of the WTP was estimated to be 99 people.  This was determined using the LandView computer software developed by the EPA and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).\r\n\r\nDuring the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine from the Bucyrus WTP in which chlorine escaped offsite.  Minor leaks have been noted within the chlorine room and were handled promptly by WTP personnel.  These type responses are not considered a response action.  No threat was posed to the public or environment.\r\n\r\nIn the event of accidental release, the WTP emergency action plan contains the procedures for evacuation of the plant and immediate notification of the fire department.  The fire department's hazardous materials response unit is responsible for control of the chlorine leak and evacuation of any affected residents.  The fire department has a copy of the WTP risk management plan and conducts yearly inspections to review plant operations, equipment and procedures."
