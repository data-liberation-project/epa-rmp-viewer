ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES.\n\nAt Simmons Foods, Inc. we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Simmons Foods, Inc. strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets, both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Van Buren Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n2.    THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of poultry products.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3.    THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO?S.\n\nThis location has prepared a worst case release and an alternate case release scenario by using the ALOHA and RMPComp air dispersion modeling software. We also used MARPLOT for mapping the distance to the toxic end point. \n\nDocumentation of these "

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nIn the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, this facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.    THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Travis Scarrow, Facility Operations Manager.  Travis Scarrow will administrate in conjunction with the Simmons Foods, Inc. management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Crawford County LEPC and the Van Buren Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\n6.    THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility?s ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity,  procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employee of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administration controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.\n\nThe process hazard analysis report prepared for the facility in January of 2004 identified various recommendations to minimize the risk of accidental releases and improve safet"
