These cylinders are received at the northeast corner of the warehouse loading dock.   Cylinders are restrained by chains and are stored outdoors beneath the warehouse canopy.  They remain in storage for less than two weeks before being loaded onto trucks for delivery to customers.  The chlorine is shipped in cylinders compliant with DOT requirements.\n\nChlorine is a stable greenish-yellow gas or clear, amber colored liquid with a suffocating, pungent, irritating odor.  The National Fire Protection Association ranks the health hazards of this substance as high.  Chlorine is non-flammable but many metals ignite in the presence of chlorine.  This substance should be stored away from heat and ignition sources.\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analyses Results\n\nHBCC assessed the quantity of regulated substances in the warehouse processes by reviewing storage capacities, production information, and Tier 2 reports submitted annually under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). Next, release scenarios were identified that reach a toxic endpoint off-site.  An endpoint is a concentration of the regulated substance listed by the Federal government to establish population zones that would be vulnerable to impacts from an accidental release of the substance.  HBCC used USEPA\u0012s RMP*Comp model as the method for determining distance to an endpoint and, in the worst-case scenario, for identifying which release from the facility would result in the greatest distance to a receptor.  The model results in very conservative distances to endpoints.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario uses the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint.  As a result, HBCC selected a release of the anhydrous ammonia bulk storage"

Release time is 10 minutes to evacuate all tank contents.  Urban topography was selected on the model.  RMP*Comp calculates the distance to a toxic endpoint as 3.4 miles.  Sensitive public receptors occur within this distance as noted in RMPSubmit and in the RMP Public Document.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAlternative release scenarios are more credible scenarios that could result in a release affecting endpoints off-site.  The alternative release scenario for chlorine was identified after conducting the Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) for this RMP.\n\nScenario:  A release of Anhydrous Ammonia results from a rupture of the 1/2-inch hose used to fill cylinders.  No passive mitigation is in place but operators shut down manual valve within one minute.  Active mitigation is estimated to reduce the release rate by 25%.  Urban topography was selected on the model.  RMP*Comp computes the distance to the toxic endpoint as 0.2 miles.  Sensitive public receptors occur within this distance as noted in RMPSubmit and in the RMP Public Document.\n\nAs a result of the hose rupture, the cylinder may back flow vapor which would freeze and seal off valve.  Estimated that a maximum of 10 pounds would be lost in addition to what comes out of the pipe for a release duration of one minute.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for Chlorine Cylinders\n\nScenario:  The valve on a 150-pound chlorine cylinder does not seat properly and leaks while in storage at the warehouse.  There is no passive mitigation available.  HBCC personnel contact the Fire Department and its qualified hazardous materials management contractor upon discovery of any chlorine release.

A key training method for process operations involves on-the-job supervision over extended time periods, using repeated demonstration of correct process steps in accordance with written procedures.  HBCC's Operations Manager (and Emergency Coordinator) for the City of Industry facility has worked there for over 30 years and has substantial experience in dealing safely with anhydrous ammonia and chlorine cylinders.\n\nWith respect to the chlorine cylinder warehouse process, HBCC's standard operating procedures include routine observation of container integrity during loading and unloading of these cylinders.  For example, two people are always present during loading and unloading to ensure safe container handling using forklifts or hand trucks.  Cylinders are stored upright, caps on, and strapped or chained in accordance with OSHA requirements for compressed gases.  Cylinders are all DOT compliant and they are maintained during every refill by the supplier.\n\n\nSummary of 5-Year Accident History\n\nOn the basis of a review with the HBC process hazard assessment team during preparation of this RMP, there have been no accidents or accidental releases involving the regulated substances in the last five years at the City of Industry facility.  The facility has an excellent safety record.  \n\n\nSummary of the Emergency Response Program\n\nHBCC's City of Industry facility has a written Hazardous Materials Business Plan (Emergency Response Plan).

The anhydrous ammonia system is configured to fill individual cylinders of varying capacity (50 lb, 100 lb, and 150 lb) as dictated by customer needs.  Additionally smaller tank vehicles are filled for transport to customer sites.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used in the neutralization of plant wastewater before discharge to the city sewer.  All uses of anhydrous ammonia on-site are at ambient temperature with system pressures varying accordingly.  The presence of tanker trucks does not increase the amount of anhydrous on-site.  The anhydrous ammonia process flow is presented in the Process Technology section of HBCC's Prevention Program.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is an inorganic toxic gas, liquefied under pressure and stored at ambient temperature at the facility.  It is a stable, colorless gas or liquid with an extremely pungent odor.  It is a strong irritant to eyes, skin, mucous membranes, and the respiratory system.  The National Fire Protection Association ranks the health hazards of ammonia as high.  Anhydrous ammonia has a very high auto-ignition temperature and is difficult to ignite."
