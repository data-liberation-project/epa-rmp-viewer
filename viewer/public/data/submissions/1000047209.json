To accomplish this we integrated health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\n\n\nIn the Hexion Inc., Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\n\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the facility's Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility produces formaldehyde solutions and phenol-formaldehyde and related resins using methanol, formaldehyde and phenol as the primary raw materials.  The site includes formaldehyde production and a series of phenolic resin reactors housed in four area units.   The Louisville Plant also grinds phenolic resin into a powdered finished product.  \n\n\n\nThe formaldehyde plant is comprised of two operating units and multiple storage tanks.  While a portion of the formaldehyde is sold as a raw material to customers, a significant amount is used on site to produce phenolic resin.   Formaldehyde is handled in closed piping systems; process equipment is hard piped to weigh tanks and reactors. Formaldehyde is pumped from storage tanks directly to rail cars and tank trucks.  \n\n\n\nTwo general types of phenolic "

Handling the raw materials safely and carrying out reactions in the safest manner are keys to good process safety performance.\n\n\n\n3.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Louisville plant has a comprehensive process safety management program pursuant to the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations.  A safety management system is in place at the facility which includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, and a documentation (filing) system to maintain records of compliance.  The Site Leader has overall responsibility for this program.\n\n\n\nA site Leadership Team meets bi-weekly, a portion of the meeting is dedicated to discussing relevant safety issues and to verify that all tasks are being completed on schedule. An associate safety team, which is comprised of a first line supervisor, technicians and operators, also meets monthly and is responsible for improving safety performance in the plant. \n\n\n\nThe Louisville site has implemented a Process Safety Management system, intended to satisfy OSHA PSM requirements.  Process hazard analyses are conducted prior to startup of major project installations, and then on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release. Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action item database to track the items to completion. \n\n\n\nA Management of Change system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents.  For equipment, procedure, and process changes, an MOC initiates a safety review.  This review may include a process hazard analysis.  Changes to product formulations intiate"

Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change has been made.\n\n\n\nThe site has a documented preventive maintenance program to insure the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  This program is managed using a computer database. Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed and documented when complete.  The schedule is based on plant experience, manufacturer guidelines, and accepted industry practices to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\n\n\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices that prevent accidental releases.  One important section describes safety measures for performing \"hot\" work in the plant; one example is welding; the procedure includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire.  The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance.  This procedure reduces the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release in addition to providing protection to maintenance personnel.\n\n\n\nPlant supervision and safety professionals provide safety orientation training for contractors who perform work in the plant.  The objective of this training is to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices.\n\n\n\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence.  These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.  Major incidents are investigated using a formal root cause evaluation process.  All investigations and recommendations are tracked in an electronic database.  \n\n\n\nHexion Inc. periodically conducts assessments of its safety and environmental programs using company personnel fro"

All recommendations are tracked in an electronic database.\n\n\n\nHexion Inc. has actively participated in community outreach programs that have been established in the Rubbertown (Louisville Industrial Area)area to provide a forum for discussing the concerns of our neighbors.  Hexion Inc. regularly participates on a local Community Advisory Council and neighborhood association.  \n\n\n\n4.0 Five-year accident history\n\n\n\nHexion Inc. has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past 5 year period, there have been no accidental releases of a regulated substance exceeding the reportable requirement. \n\n\n\n5.0 Emergency response program\n\n\n\nHexion Inc. on-site emergency response team is trained to meet or exceed the training requirements for hazardous materials technicians and incident commanders.  Approximately eighty associates are trained to the hazardous materials technician level.  The plant has a mobile trailer equipped to respond to hazardous material incidents that could occur on site.  \n\n\n\nThe Louisville emergency response plan describes procedures for actual and threatened releases, including coordination with outside agencies.
