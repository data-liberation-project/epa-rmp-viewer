Employees participated in the system review and process hazards analysis.  The Company has trained and properly equipped its employees who will be responding to potential releases from these systems.  Also, the Company's emergency response procedures provide for notification of outside emergency responders to give on-site assistance and/or emergency evacuation/shelter-in-place notification of affected residents in the event of an ammonia or chlorine release.\r\nStationary source and regulated substance handled\r\n\r\nThe Coffeen Power Plant is located in Montgomery County, Illinois, approximately 2.5 miles south of the city of Coffeen on man-made Coffeen Lake.  Coffeen plant began producing electricity in 1965.\r\n\r\nThe plant installed a selective catalytic reduction unit (SCR) on one of its two coal-fired units in the fall of 2001. The SCR unit began commercial operation in May 2002.  A second SCR began operation in 2003.  \r\n\r\nAs a part of the SCR system, an anhydrous ammonia injection system was installed to supply ammonia gas to the combustion exit gas for the purpose of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions control.  Commercial grade anhydrous ammonia (99.5% or higher purity with a maximum water content of 0.5%) is required for this system.  \r\nThe ammonia is stored in two 50,000-gallon tanks. From the storage tanks, the anhydrous ammonia travels through a pump skid to a vaporizer skid.  When storage tank pressure is greater than 50 psig, the pumps are bypassed and the ammonia flows directly to the vaporizer.  The vaporizer uses steam to vaporize the ammonia.  Ammonia gas then passes to the mixing chamber where it is diluted with air.  This ammonia and dilution air mixture is piped to the distribution"

As the ammoniated exhaust gas flows over the SCR catalyst bed, the NOx is reduced to nitrogen (N2) and water vapor. \r\n\r\nWorst-case release scenario and alternative-case release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario for ammonia involves the loss of 218,875 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within ten minutes due to a hole in the storage tank.  The resulting vapor cloud is predicted to travel off-site for a distance of 5.0 miles before reaching safe levels.\r\nSeveral alternative case release scenarios were examined for ammonia.  The alternate release scenario chosen and reported in this plan is a release of 1860 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per minute for one hour due to the rupture of a 2 inch pipe line on the bottom of the storage tank.  The resulting vapor cloud is predicted to travel for a distance of 0.3 miles before reaching safe levels.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia system has sensors to detect ammonia leaks, and spray nozzles that will automatically activate to minimize the possibility of a catastrophic release of ammonia from the tank and feed system.  There are also pressure relief valves on the storage tanks, as well as flow control valves to sense changes in flow and automatically close.  The two 50,000-gallon ammonia storage tanks are located so that accidental contact with vehicles is unlikely.  \r\nAn emergency shower/eyewash facility is located at the unloading area, and guardrails are installed to prevent vehicular contact during unloading activities.  Also, the Company has developed administrative controls to monitor the ammonia filling process to reduce the likelihood of a release during filling.\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\nThe importance of preventing any releases is stressed through on the job and initial and refresher training.  Company personnel will adhere to the system vendor's"

If the leak cannot be isolated, and outside assistance is deemed necessary, the Company will notify 911.  This will trigger notification of the Coffeen Fire Department to begin evacuation of the surrounding area.  The Ambulance Service, Montgomery County's Sheriff Department, Illinois State Police Hazmat Team, the Montgomery County Emergency Service Disaster Agency (ESDA), and the Illinois Emergency Management Association (IEMA) would also be notified by the 911 coordinator.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe process will be audited and systems will be inspected regularly to ensure that it remains safe to operate.  The Company has implemented a Management of Change procedure to evaluate the safety and adequacy of any changes that may have to be made to the system.\r\n\r\nThe facility has made a process change and eliminated the use of gaseous chlorine for biofouling control in June 2016."
