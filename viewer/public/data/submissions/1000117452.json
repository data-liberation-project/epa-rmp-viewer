The properties which make ammonia valuable as a\nrefrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions. Simmons Foods, Inc. strives to protect all its\nvaluable resources and assets, both personnel and property. We live and have families in this\ncommunity. We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our\ncommunity, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment. It is our policy to comply\nwith all Federal, State, and local regulations. Through continual, accurate training and various safety\ndevices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous\nammonia as well as other emergencies. We work in conjunction with the Gentry Fire Department\nand the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected\nneighbors.\n\n2.THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of poultry products. We utilize anhydrous\nammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing. An outside company is used\nto fill our main receiver tanks. Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling\nor freezing units. Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management\npersonnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3.THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThis location has prepared a worst case release and an alternate case release scenario by using the\nRMPComp air dispersion modeling software and MARPLOT for mapping the distance to the toxic\nend point and understanding the number of persons affected.\n\nDocumentation of these scenar"
