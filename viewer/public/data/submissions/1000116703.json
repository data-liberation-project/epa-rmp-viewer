Brakebush-Irving uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for the production and storage areas.  Brakebush-Irving is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of 11.0 in of vacuum to a high side of 185 psi.  The systems maximum intended inventory is 47,410 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nBrakebush-Irving worst case release is the catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system.  The maximum capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is 19,692 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia at 100% full.  The normal operating level in the HPR is 40% or 7877 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The worst case scenario takes into account the possibility the vessel would be 74% full, holding 14,589 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Using the ALOHA program downloaded from the EPA home page, the calculated endpoint was 1.5 miles down wind.  Based on the census data provided the population within the radius of the toxic endpoint is 17,846, with 6,182 residential housing, in the area.  There are no medical center within this area.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario is the catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system.  The vessel capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is described above.  Although the worst case scenario is a requirement by the RMP ruling, it is not a likely scenario to take place.  Brakebush-Irving follows the industrial standards to assure proper material is used in the ammonia refrigeration system.  By following the industrial standards and the EPA/OSHA standards, the shell failure is unlikely.\n\nANSI/IIAR-2 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems.\n\nANSI/ASHRAE 15-1992 Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\n\nASME/ANSI B31.5"

The alternative release was a pressure relief valve function or failure was most likely the cause of an ammonia release.  Using the tables provided, a pressure relief valve release 86.76 lbs./min of ammonia for 10 minutes from the High Pressure Receiver.  The toxic endpoint for the release is .1 mile down wind.  The estimated population within the distance would be 240 residents, with 97 residential housing.  There are no schools or hospitals in the area.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nBrakebush-Irving has established steps to include initial training under the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER.  The facility has established annual retraining for all personnel that re on the HAZMAT team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an ammonia release.  Brakebush-Irving has also coordinated efforts with the Fire department to establish a joint response program.  Brakebush-Irving established plans and procedures are periodically reviewed and at least annually assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Plan:\n\nBrakebush-Irving has trained personnel that are refrigeration operators to assure they can perform their responsibilities and procedures safely.  The refrigeration operators receive training on the ammonia system when there is a change in the system and at minimum of every three years.  Brakebush-Irving has also trained personnel in the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Program, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER.  The trained personnel have been trained at the level of the technicians level responder and also the incident commander on scene.  The tr"
