This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident\n       prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design,\n       installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes. Sulphur River\n       Resources, L.C. (Sulphur River) policy is to implement reasonable controls to\n       prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur,\n       trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n  \n            DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n       SUBSTANCES\n  \n            Sulphur River owns and operates the Bryans Mill Gas Plant located in Cass\n       County, Texas. The Bryans Mill Gas Plant is a gas separation, dehydration,\n       sweetening, and processing facility. The inlet streams entering the plant go through\n       separators where crude oil/condensate is separated from the wet gas. The crude\n       oil/condensate is transferred to a raw crude tank and then stabilized in a stabilizer\n       tank. The wet, sour gas stream from the separator is dehydrated using a glycol\n       dehydration system. The dehydrated sour gas is compressed and sent to the Selexol\n       Sweetening Unit where the acid gases (H2S and C02) are removed. The sweet gas\n       is then processed through a cryogenic unit where methane, ethane, and propane are\n       separated from the heavier hydrocarbons. The natural gas liquids from the\n       cryogenic unit are sent to the stabilized crude tanks, where it is combined with the\n       crude oil stream. The residue gas from the cryogenic unit is piped off site. The\n       acid gas from the Selexol Sweetening Unit is recovered in a sulfur recovery unit\n       (SRU). The tail gas from the SRU is sent to an incinerator for destruction.\n       Produc"

      "SummaryText": "ts are transported from the facility via pipeline and truck.\n  \n            The Bryans Mill Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable\n       or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity. Based on process knowledge,\n       Sulphur River identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.\n  \n            Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the\n       Bryans Mill Gas Plant are NGL/condensate, raw crude (condensate), propane and\n       natural gas liquids. However, Sulphur River has determined that raw crude\n       (condensate) has an NFPA flammability hazard rating of 3, which exempts this\n       mixture from threshold determination. Based on worst-case analysis, the distance\n       to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors. In addition, the Bryans\n       Mill Gas Plant is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's\n       (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM). Therefore, the Bryans Mill Gas\n       Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP program.\n  \n       OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n  \n       Flammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n  \n       The endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure\n       (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion. The ARP Program\n       requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud\n       explosion. A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the\n       explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint based\n       on TNT-equivalent methods. Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable\n       substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms\n       a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable. NGL/condensate is\n       the worst-case flammable release with a 1.07-mile distance to the endpoint.\n  \n       Flammable Substanc"

      "SummaryText": "es - Alternative-Case Scenario\n  \n       A single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under\n       the ARP program. A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been\n       identified for propane as follows. Seal failure on the propane make-up pump causes\n       a release from a 1-inch opening at 225 psig and 150 degrees F. The release is\n       assumed to continue for 10 minutes. The propane will vaporize and may ignite in\n       a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of I psi overpressure or a vapor cloud\n       fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability limit (LFL) for propane. The\n       alternative-case release of propane resulted in a 0. 11 -mile distance to the 1 psi\n       overpressure endpoint.\n  \n       Toxic Substances\n  \n       The Bryans Mill Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the\n       threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative-case release\n       scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\n  \n  GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n  \n  The following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the\n  Bryans Mill Gas Plant. Because the processes at the plant that are regulated by the\n  Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation\n  are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM\n  elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident\n  prevention program.\n  \f  Employee Participation\n  \n  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of\n  the Bryans Mill Gas Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the\n  objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic,\n  reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.
