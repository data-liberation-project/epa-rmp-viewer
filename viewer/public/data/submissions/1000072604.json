In the event of a liquid ammonia leak, the king\n\nvalves (outlet of the high pressure liquid receiver) can be closed manually to prevent flow of\n\nammonia liquid to downstream equipment. The system can be shutdown by the \n\n emergency stop stations located in the engine room.  In addition, ammonia sensors located in the engine room.\n\nThe facility is equipped with a sprinkler system.\n\nResponse Capabilities\n\nThe facility evacuates only and relies on the Madison Fire Department and the ammonia contractor for response.\n\nAmmonia System Summary\n\nMajor equipment components include:\n\n?6 Compressors\n\n?60 Evaporators\n\n?2 Evaporative Condensers\n\n?1 Purger\n\n?3 Liquid Recirculators\n\n?6 Ammonia Pumps\n\n?1 High Pressure Liquid Receiver\n\n?2 Brine Chillers\n\nAmmonia inventory: 27,049 lbs.\n\nAmmonia system operators: One and one assistant operator.\n\nAmmonia System Contractor: Stellar Refrigeration, phone: 904-899-9423\n\nProcess Safety Management/Risk Management Program Description\n\nThe facility has a fully implemented process safety management / risk management program including:\n\nEmployee Involvement "
