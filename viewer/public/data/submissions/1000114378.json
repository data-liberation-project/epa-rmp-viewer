The MOC system includes the following considerations before any process changes take place:\n\u0095\tAuthorization requirement for the change\n\u0095\tTechnical basis for the proposed change\n\u0095\tImpact of the change on health and safety\nAfter changes are made, all affected employees will be informed about the change and training will be provided to the affected employees prior to startup of the modified process.  In addition, the PSI and applicable operating procedures will be updated to reflect the changes made.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):\nWhen change to the process is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the MOC, the Cooperative will conduct a PSSR.  The PSR Team Leader will develop a checklist and assemble a team of key personnel to go over every element on the checklist during the PSSR.  All PSSR members will be knowledgeable about the process and trained in the area of change.\n\nContractors:\nThe Cooperative has developed and implemented safe work practices to control the entrance, presence and exit of contract employees in covered process areas.  It is the Cooperative\u0092s policy to select safe contractors, provide appropriate safety related information to contractors, develop safe work practices related to contractors and periodically evaluate contractors.\nThe Cooperative will also inform contractors of the known potential fire, explosion or toxic release hazards related to the contractors work and the process.

The anhydrous ammonia is primarily used as a raw material to produce Ammonium Polyphosphate fertilizer.  The Center Fertilizer Plant may also sell anhydrous ammonia for fertilizer application and industrial refrigeration.  \nThe properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer and refrigeration source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling and storage.  It is the policy of the Cooperative and its employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community.  Safety depends upon the competent training of Cooperative personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios: \nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations.  The facility design and construction are in accordance with the ANSI/CGA G-2.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards.  It is formally inspected a minimum of once a year for compliance by the Colorado Department of Agriculture, along with periodic audits by EPA and OSHA.  Corrective and routine maintenance is performed at the facility to maintain compliance with the appropriate standards.
