Columbus West Terminal, hereafter referred to as the Facility, is a refined petroleum product storage and distribution facility in Columbus, OH.\n\n\n\nThe Facility handles and stores butane and various refined products.  The Facility has a fixed inventory of butane. Butane is received by truck and stored in one (1) 59,775-gallon pressurized storage vessel and subsequently injected into regular and premium gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck loading rack. The butane process has been assessed as RMP Program Level 3 and therefore meets or exceeds the accidental release and risk prevention requirements laid out in 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D. The Facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan and coordinates emergency response with the local LEPC and responders.\n\n\n\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Facility:\n\n\n\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.\n\n\n\nSunoco is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for neighbors in the community. Sunoco has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the Facility and community-wide and coordinates with the Franklin County LEPC and local Fire Departments.\n\n\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Facility is to act as a flammable liquid storage and distribution facility. Due to the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposu"

The Facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends on the manner in which flammable substances are handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the processes. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Facility. Programs have been established to help prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nFor planning purposes, Sunoco has considered the impact of worst case and alternative release scenarios. The probability of the worst case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote. The worst-case scenario is far less probable than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. Sunoco also considered the impact of a more likely loss of containment event. \n\n\n\nSunoco has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Sunoco has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures. Sunoco provides annual emergency response training to its employees. There have been no accidents reported involving the butane system at the Facility since the installation of the Butane Blending System.\n\n\n\nSunoco's management is committed to the following:\n\n- Preventing accidents;\n\n- Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Sunoco operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n- Being a good corporate citizen in Franklin County.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, the "
