Changes or improvements in the facility's equipment will be acted upon immediately following the enforcement agency (KDA's) request, or as found to be necessary by our staff.\n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site specific operating procedures, plant maintenance, and employees are competency tested over the training material. Each employee uses ammonia proof goggles amd gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of emergency safety water during nurse tank and maintenance operations.\n\nOur emergency action plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public, and the area first responders. The Cropland Co-op, Inc. provides plant tours for our local fire department and our action plans has been shared with the Stevens County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).
