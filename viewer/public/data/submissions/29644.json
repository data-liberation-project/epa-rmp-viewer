      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan covers the Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's Nacogdoches, Texas Complex.  The complex consists of both a Poultry Processing facility and a Prepared Foods facility.  Both facilities refrigeration systems are of a standard two-stage refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in each system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia on site has increased since the last RMP plan was submitted, thus prompting this update to the RMP.  Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of two ammonia release scenarios identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternate release scenario\".  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Pilgrim's Pride Nacogdoches complex involves a failure of the High Pressure Receiver under maximum storage conditions.  The computer program, RMP*Comp, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would re"

This scenario was performed using pre-defined conditions by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  The EPA-mandated meteorological conditions used for this scenario were Atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (77? F), and average humidity (50%).  \n\nThe EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n1.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia this vessel could hold would seldom if ever be reached.  The majority of the time the liquid level is approximately 50% or less. \n\n2.  Assumption is that ammonia liquefied under pressure is released at its boiling point.  At true atmospheric conditions only a fraction (about 20% of the total) of the liquid ammonia will release to the atmosphere flashing as a vapor.  The remaining un-flashed liquid will stay in the vessel or pool on the ground.\n\n3.  Requirement to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard.\n\n4.  Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6% of the area of the full circle.\n\n5.  Assumption of a ground level release when the vessel is actually on the roof.\n\n6.  Worst case weather conditions are extremely uncommon.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of ammonia due to a transfer hose failure.  The scenario, by definition, is \"more likely to occur\" than the worst case scenario and must reach an endpoint off site using the typical meteorological conditions of Atmospheric Stability Class D, wind speed of 3.0 "

We do incorporate several management systems to decrease the likelihood of this incident occurring.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n?  Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners\n?  Preventative maintenance program\n?  Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners\n?  Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\n?  Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n?  Procedure for handling all changes to the system\n?  Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\n?  Up-to-date process safety information\n?  Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\n?  Hot-work permits for work on or near the ammonia process.\n?  Line Break procedures\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.  They were also instrumental in developing the Process Safety Information.  Anhydrous ammonia pipes and valves are labeled and equipment information has been compiled.  The Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system, as required under the RMP regulations.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and respirators for the refrigeration partners' use, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.  We also give our refrigeration partners HAZMAT training on an annual basis.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, the Company perf"

Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked on a monthly basis for timely completion as required.\n\nThe Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's Nacogdoches complex has an emergency response program.  This program includes an emergency response notification plan, Emergency response drills and drill evaluations conducted annually; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\nPilgrim's Pride Corporation is the second largest poultry producer in the United States; the second largest in chicken and the fifth largest in turkey, the largest chicken company in Puerto Rico and the second largest chicken company in Mexico.  Pilgrims Pride Corporation employs more than 40,000 persons and has major operations in Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Mexico and Puerto Rico, with other facilities in Arizona, California, Iowa, Mississippi, Utah and Wisconsin.
