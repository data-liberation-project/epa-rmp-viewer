Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacturer gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Hydrogen and methane,\n\nin the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere\n\nto all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Air Products manages the safety of the\n\nregulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety\n\ndevices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility\n\nand other control systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe\n\nwork practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant. Our\n\nemergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER regulations. The emergency\n\nresponse plan includes procedures and the notification of the Industrial Emergency Services (IES) Response Team\n\nso that appropriate measures can be taken to control accidental releases. This document has been\n\nprepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The\n\nsubstances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios\n\ndescribed were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide\n\n(syngas). Our customer uses carbon monoxide gas. Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline\n\nand used as feedstock. The f"

      "SummaryText": "eedstock is reacted in the reformer furnace. By exposing the feedstock\n\ncatalyst in the presence of heat (~1,800 F) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts\n\nthe feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide is\n\nthen separated from the hydrogen in a HyCO coldbox.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is a flammable gas mixture containing hydrogen and\n\nmethane.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental\n\nRelease Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility\n\nwas designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4. Five year accident history:\n\nThis is a new facility. There have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable\n\ngas.\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. At this site,\n\nemployees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside\n\nemergency response teams. Employees have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness\n\nLevel. The employees will receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.\n\nEmergency response activities will be coordinated with Covestro's Emergency Response Team.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and incident investigations, some of which may\n\nresult in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures.\n\n"
