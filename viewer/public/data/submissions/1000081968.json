      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Meraux refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to monitor and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Meraux Refinery, located in Meraux, Louisiana, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, diesel fuels and gasoline) from raw crude oil. The refinery contains Part 68-regulated Flammable Mixtures (which contain variable combinations of propane, butane, propylene, isobutane, isopentane, pentane, ethane, methane, and hydrogen).  A variety of flammable mixtures classified as Rating 4 (highly flammable) per the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) system with different compositions are also present at the refinery. \n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Meraux Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Meraux Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information cr"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Meraux Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operating procedures for each process.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of co"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and the controls that are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Meraux Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the refinery leadership team for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo verify that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Meraux Refinery periodically updates and revalid"

Examples of these include (1) monitoring the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure that requires isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to monitor activities that might produce ignition sources (i.e., hot work) in areas where flammable materials could be present, and (5) a permit and procedure that require that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system that promotes the safe performance of operations and maintenance activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Meraux Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), and procedures, as well as other facility changes that could affect covered processes.  This system requires that changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to verify that (1) adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided appropriate training on the change.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Meraux Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release, that caused major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injur"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Meraux Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the Meraux Refinery provide guidance on how to prevent or respond to exceedances beyond upper or lower limits specified for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Meraux Refinery has implemented a thorough training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n \n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Meraux Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Meraux Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
