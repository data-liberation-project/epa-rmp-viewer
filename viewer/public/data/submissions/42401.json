      "SummaryText": "\nEast Penn Manufacturing Company, Inc. is a producer of lead storage batteries with all storage battery manufacturing facilities located at Lyon Station, Pennsylvania.  East Penn provides jobs for over 4000 employees and is one of the regions largest employers.  In conjunction with lead storage battery manufacture at the Lyon Station, PA site, East Penn owns and operates a secondary lead smelter for the purpose of reclaiming lead and other materials from spent batteries.  East Penn recycles nearly 100% of materials from used, spent lead-acid batteries.  The smelter utilizes an ammonia scrubber to remove Sulfur Dioxide from the process gas streams of both the reverbatory and blast furnaces and maintains onsite a 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank and piped delivery system to the scrubber headers.   The ammonia scrubber and ammonia tank and piping was designed and built according to generally accepted good engineering practices in accordance with the requirements of the ASME code for pressure vessels and 29 CFR 1910.111 - Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nAs stated in our written EHS policy, East Penn is committed to complying with all applicable government regulations and producing batteries in a way that does not jeopardize the health and safety of employees, community and the environment.  This includes taking reasonable precautions and establishing systems to ensure that a release of anhydrous ammonia at hazardous concentrations does not occur.  East Penn is also committed to the maintenance of an onsite,  trained and capable emergency response team and hazardous materials team to minimize the severity and duration of a release, should one occur and to work closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Berks County Response Team to minimize offsite impacts.   \n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Release Prevention Program has been established and implemented according to the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.119 and consists of the fol"

      "SummaryText": "lowing elements:  1.  Daily visual and monthly documented visual inspection of tank, valves, guages and piping by Smelter management.  2.  Visual inspection of tank and components by anhydrous ammonia supplier.  3.  Triannual compliance audit of process safety management plan and update of process hazard analysis - the most recent of which was conducted on and around 10/01/2001.  4.  Initial training and annual refresher training for all maintenance and plant personnel who operate or perform maintenance on the ammonia scrubber system.  Ammonia awareness training is also conducted for all employees who work in the building and immediate vicinity of the ammonia scrubber and components.  5.  All incidents that resulted in or could have resulted in a release to the environment are reported to the Environmental, Safety& Health Department for investigation.  The investigation team consists of the EHS Department, Smelter Management, and affected employees.  6.  Rules for contractors, maintenance activities and hot work permits exist, however, there is minimal contractor involvement in this operation.\n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nOn July 13, 2004 A contract employee team was working on the ammonia system.  The scope of the work was upgrades to equipment.  The contractor was responsible for the purging of tank and lines so new valves and appurtances could be installed on the tank and a new solenoid valve, for remote shutoff, could be installed.  The contractor had partially purged the tank and lines on the first day of the project. On the second day of the project the contractor failed to open a valve on the process line to purge to line.  When the contractor attempted to unbolt a flange residual ammonia in the line released for an estimated 10-15 seconds. The contractor was in close proximity to the flange and experienced second degree burns of the face, left arm, chest.  Corrective action focused on the need for contractor to have a written checklist for working on equipment a"

Arrangements have also been made with the local (Berks County) Hazardous Materials Response Team to respond to leaks if conditions dictate or the release has the potential to have offsite consequences.  Members of East Penn's Hazardous Materials Team have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.  \n\nPLANNED SAFETY CHANGES\nIn June and July 2004 Inspections and upgrades included thickness testing of tank walls, replacement of pressure relief valves,  replacement of highflow valves, installation of a solenoid valve which will allow for remote shutdown of process line.  Inspection of tank indicated no changes required."
