All applicable procedures of the ANSI K-61.1 \u00bf 1989 revision of the \u00bfSafe Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,\u00bf as adopted by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) are adhered to. Our emergency response policy involves the emergency response services available in our community.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks with a total capacity of 245,140 gallons of water capacity.  The storage tanks (30,000 gallons and 26,000 gallons), several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility\u00bfs anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility is manned during the season and is operational through normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \u00bfworst-case\u00bf release and \u00bfalternative\u00bf release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of a vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \u00bfworst-case\u00bf release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the tank releasing the entire 131,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from the largest tank.  The worst-case scenario used EPA\u00bfs recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an \u00bfF\u00bf atmospheric stability class.  A rural topography was selected as typical.

The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \u00bfD\u00bf atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario. The distance to the toxic endpoint is .92 miles.  The population with in that area is estimated to be 1,332 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.\n\nUnited Farmers Mercantile Company has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years.  Even thought the company has had no releases it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nUnited Farmers Mercantile Company has several key elements in its accident prevention plan:\n1.\tThe anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations that are based on the 1989 revision of the ANSI K61.1 adopted in 1990 by the State of Iowa.\n2.\tAnnual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia. The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n3.\tUse of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids. \n4.\tFrequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5.\tAnnual inspections by IDALS fertilizer inspectors include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.  \n6.\tUse of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safety to the operators and to the community."
