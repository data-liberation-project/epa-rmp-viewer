Together, these substances comprise the disinfection process for the treated effluents discharged from the plant into the St. Joseph River.   Following treatment for the removal particulate and dissolved contaminants in the waste stream, chlorine gas is injected into the treated effluent to destroy residual living organisms that may include potentially pathogenic microbes.  The oxidative power of the chlorine attacks organic formations and destabilizes their structures in very short periods of time, rendering the effluent acceptable from a water quality standpoint.  \r\nBecause our receiving stream contains dissolved organic matter resulting from the normal decay of natural organic matter, residual chlorine remaining in the effluent will also react with these naturally occurring substances.  The result is the formation of trihalomethane products that are potentially toxic to many forms of aquatic life.  To be protective of this aquatic life, it is necessary, then to remove the residual chlorine from the treated effleunts prior to discharge into the receiving stream.  This is known as dechlorination and is accomplished by injecting sulfur dioxide gas into the effluent stream.  An instantaneous reaction occurs between the residual chlorine and the sulfur dioxide creating end products that are non-threatening to the aquatic environment.\r\nAt the treatment plant site, the maximum quantity of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas that is stored at any given time is 16,000 pounds of each.  The substances are stored in 2,000-lbs pressurized vessels.  The EPA's guidelines for threshold quantities that must be regulated are 2,500 lbs and 5,000 lbs, respectively.  Therefore, the R"

      "SummaryText": "isk Management Plan for the City of Elkhart Wastewater Treatment Plant is based on these two regulated substances.\r\n\r\nSummary of Major Hazards\r\nThe hazard with either chlorine or sulfur dioxide is the potential toxicity these substances can create in our environment if a significant quantity were accidentally released.  This is especially critical because of the significant toxic effects on humans in the event of a catastrophic release.  This Risk Management Plan examines a set of scenarios that evaluate the overall impacts to our community if such a catastrophic release were ever to occur. This is done using a technique to model the event and assess the impact.  The result is a \"circle of influence\" that centers at the WWTP site and extends over the surrounding, adjacent community.  The area of the circle created from this radius is known as the zone of vulnerability.  Because chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases are heavier than air, their plumes will follow the ground in dense clouds in the direction of the prevailing wind.  The dispersion of the plume is influenced by barometric pressure, ambient temperature, and relative humidity at the time of the event, with the summer season being most critical.  The area covered by the dense plume within the zone of vulnerability is known as the hazard zone.\r\nTwo conditions are examined: a worst-case scenario, and an alternative case scenario.  In the former case, the release is catastrophic in that the container in which the substance is stored is completely ruptured, releasing all of its contents into the immediate atmosphere over a relatively short duration of time.  For this situation, the model takes into account the worst-case atmospheric conditions that may be possible to heighten the extent of the impact to its maximum level.  \r\nFor the alternative case scenario, the model evaluates releases substantially less than worst-case catastrophes.  These occurrences are those which may be plausible within the normal day-to-day"

Within the vulnerability zone for the worst case scenario for the controlling chemical, sulfur dioxide, are 122 sensitive public receptors affected, which include public centers such as schools, healthcare centers, etc., multifamily residential facilities, sensitive commercial and industrial areas,  and public parks.  This zone also encroaches into St. Joseph County by approximately 0.45 miles at a point directly west of the source point.  The zone of vulnerability for the worst-case chlorine release extends 3.2 miles and encroaches St. Joseph County on the west by 0.32 miles.\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis also examines alternative scenarios, ones which may be more likely to occur due to normal operating conditions.  These release scenarios, though typically minor in comparison to catastrophic events, can nevertheless, create offsite impacts.  A key to analyzing these impacts is taking into account active or passive mitigation of the release event due to in-place preventive measures that reduce the impact of the release.  An example of this would be containment of the release within the building which houses the chemical.  The USEPA has developed through its modeling research that containment can reduce the offsite impact by 55 percent.  \r\nIn modeling the alternative release scenarios for the City of Elkhart's RMP, the model was executed in two steps.  First, the actual release within the containment building was modeled.  Then, an iterative set of runs were made to account for the mitigation factor to establish the \"maximum average sustained rate of release\" for areas outside the building that create the offsite impact.  It is from this second, iterative solution that the offsite consequences can be analyzed.  Details of the modeling process are described in the RMP. \r\n\r\nHow Releases are Prevented\r\nIn order to minimize the risk of a catastrophic release or releases of lower magnitude, a prevention plan is in place.

For the wastewater treatment facility, both the chlorine and SO2 facilities operations are enclosed in buildings designed for containment of a release.  Secondly, the system components responsible for delivering the gases safely into the plant stream are monitored daily and fully maintained annually.  Thirdly, automated gas sensors are in each facility designed to detect the presence of the gases at very low levels of 1 part per million (ppm), resulting in immediate notification alarms to plant operators at the source facility and in remote locations throughout the site.  These sensors are held to strict, regular preventive maintenance schedules for calibration and sensitivity. Finally, the Material Safety Data Sheets are on file at each location where there is a regulated substance which give information on safe handling and emergency responses to accidents involving those substances. \r\n\r\nAdditional Steps Taken to Address Hazards\r\nSteps are continuing to further improve the prevention of a release either minimal or catastrophic.  Beyond the passive mitigation measures and the sensing systems already in place as described above, additional site infrastructure elements and best management practices are under development and implementation.  With respect to infrastructure, operational facilities are being renovated to accommodate greater space for operators to move and work and carry out their duties, and installation of additional on-line sensing systems that link to the site's Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for improved monitoring of the operational environment.  Managerially, efforts are in place to phase out use of older pressure vessels in normal operations, improve documented training activities.\r\n\r\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release\r\nThe Elkhart Wastewater Treatment facility has always, and will continue to practice the policy that employees WILL NOT re"

These procedures include entities for notification in the case of an emergency in order or immediate priority, and procedures for handling injuries of personnel resulting from the release.
