This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan. Only the facilities used for this product will be included in this report.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct applications for farm fields during the early spring and late fall months. During the balance of the year, inventories will be storage only, with little, if any product transfer taking place. The maximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is 160,000 lbs. The maximum on site vessel size is 18,000 gallons, storing 79,000 lbs. The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs. Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspedted at various times day or night during use, and through out the \"off season\" when not in use.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\nThe worst-case scenario woud be release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank, release as a gas liquefied by pressure over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity release would be 79,000 lbs., based on a 85"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm ) is .94 miles.\nAlternate Release Scenario:\nA 3\" transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds. The distance to the end-point is .60 miles ( The most likely incident would be a release from a break in a 1\" hose scenario followed by a release for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released with this scenario would be 2,901 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles.\nAccidental Release Program:\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, our accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; Additionally, we conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of anhydrous ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, break-away couplers at risers, emergency shut-off valves, barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and lock outs to prevent tampering when site is unattended. Finally, we maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.\nFive Year Accident History:\nWe have not had a release of Anhydrous Ammonia within the past five years that has caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; nor to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, p"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific recommendations for implementation at this time."
