The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge of 17,657 lbs which is over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nThe top priority of Diversified Foods and Seasonings, Inc. is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.  In this effort Diversified Foods & Seasonings, Inc. has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA) PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management?s Prevention Program 3 and therefore been integrated.  Of the 14 PSM elements 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response.  It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe facility has developed an Emergency Response Plan with the intent to take control of an incident until the Nebraska City Fire Department arrives on the scene.  Once the Fire Department arrives they will assume the role of Incident Commander.  Diversified Foods & Seasonings has designated and trained, to the Hazardous Materials Technicians Level, employees that will assist in the emergency response.  This strategic approach combines the expertise and the response team of the Nebraska City Fire Department with the facility and process knowledge of the Diversified Foods & Seasonings staff.  Div"

The manufacturing process includes refrigerated spaces and production equipment that utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO \nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for the reported scenario have been completed and are included in the enclosed RMP Submittal text file.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternate release scenarios, EPA?s RMP Comp was utilized.  RMP Comp is an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW 6 mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2000 data.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS  \n\nEPA?s Risk Management Prevention Program 3, 40 CFR Part 68(D) and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 outline the facilities accidental release prevention program.
