      "SummaryText": "1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Kraft Foods facility in Columbia, Missouri has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  This facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders for ammonia releases.  This facility has implemented the Kraft FoodsA? electronic preventive maintenance system.  This system uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.  The facility also performs holiday and process shutdowns and inspections are done during those times.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Columbia Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nAt this location Kraft Foods Global processes meat products.  The SIC code for the  primary process at this facility is 2013.  This facility is capable of producing and packaging various meat products including hot dogs, beef franks, and turkey franks for consumer intake.  The plant is not equipped to slaughter hogs; boxed trimmings are shipped to the plant.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products.  Some of these areas include: receiving, raw material cooler, pre-blend, preparation/stuffing, stripping, packaging, palletizing, finished product coolers, and other storage areas.  The plant produces smoked hot dogs in smokehouses located on-site and also uses condensed natural smoke.  \n\n\n\nKraft Foods has one regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, ammonia, at this location.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the plantA?s refrigeration process.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68"

      "SummaryText": " is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is 76,346 lbs.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable ammonia at the Kraft Foods Global Plant located in Columbia, MO.\n\n\n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, KraftA?s ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\n\n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n\n\n1. The main piping system for the ammonia process is located on the roof of the plant.  This serves as an excellent safeguard for plant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping inside occupied rooms.  Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery and so there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\n2. The plant maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures. \n\n\n\n3. The plant periodically shuts down parts of the ammonia system and conducts inspections.  \n\n\n\n4.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nThis facility did not have an accident in the past five years.\n\n \n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams. The Emergency Response Plan contains a list of employees who should be contacted in the event of an emergency.  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency response training as well as a detailed description of the training content.   There are also"

The Columbia Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  In all cases where an ambulance is notified of an emergency the fire department will be notified via the ambulance service.\n\n\n\n6.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBased on the A?what-if\" PHA completed for ammonia, a list of action items was developed and is being monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished.  A plan with neighbor 3M to handle evacuations during inclimate weather has been arranged."
