      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nExecutive Summary\nBrandon Shores Aqueous Ammonia RMP\n2011 Update\n\nFacility Overview\n\nThe Brandon Shores Power Plant, owned and operated by Constellation Power Source Generation (CPSG), is located near Baltimore, Maryland in northern Anne Arundel County.  It is a fossil fueled electric generating facility consisting of two 650 megawatt coal fired units.  To improve air quality and comply with Maryland Clean Air requirements, pollution control technology called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) was installed in 2001 to reduce NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions by 90%.\n\nSCRs use ammonia to react with the NOx in the combustion gas to form harmless nitrogen gas and water.  Because safety of CPSG employees and the surrounding community is of utmost concern to CPSG, Brandon Shores primarily uses technology that generates ammonia from urea on an as-needed basis.   Urea is a less hazardous solid that can react to form ammonia on-site to reduce transportation risks and to minimize on-site quantities of ammonia.  Since the urea technology had not been fully proven when the SCR was under design and construction, Brandon Shores also has a 30% aqueous ammonia system that is available as a back-up system incase the urea system is out of service due to operational problems or for maintenance.  The SCR ammonia system is kept approximately 60% full for use when the urea system is not operational to support year round operation of the SCR with minimal disruptions. \n\nThe SCR aqueous ammonia system consists of three 18,000-gallon storage tanks surrounded by a dike wall.  The aqueous ammonia is pumped form the storage tanks to a vaporizer  The vaporizer uses steam to heat the ammonia solution converting it into a vapor.  The ammonia vapor is mixed with air and injected into the SCR.  The ammonia vapor reacts with the NOx in the presence of the catalyst to form harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor.\n\nSafety features include:\n\nA?    Diked/protected storage and unloading area"

Surveillance camera for 24 hour observation;\nA?    Ammonia monitors around the perimeter;\nA?    Water cannons for vapor suppression.\n\nBrandon Shores has another 30% aqueous ammonia tank that supplies ammonia for pH control for the boiler feedwater (cycle chemistry process).  This tank has a capacity of 5000 gallons.  It is surrounded by a dike that drains directly into a 70,000 gallon sump located under the storage tank.\n\nRelease Prevention Policies\n\nCPSG believes that safety and health are our highest value and all injuries and most illnesses are preventable.  Operating safely, with constant focus on accident prevention and occupational health processes, is the most efficient way to manage our business.  It is the best way to safeguard our employees and the communities in which we are located.  Our safety concern extends not only to that of our fellow employees, but also to our families, customers, contractors, visitors, and communities in which we operate.\n\nCPSG utilizes effective accident prevention strategies such as safety in engineering design, training, behavior-based initiatives, and administrative controls to safeguard against workplace hazards.  We have a comprehensive accidental release prevention program based on the following key elements:\n\nA?    Hazard review - A detailed hazard analysis was performed identifying risks and recommendations for reducing the potential for and impact of releases.  All design recommendations have been incorporated.\nA?    Designing a safe facility - CPSG elected to use urea technology to generate ammonia on-site for the SCR as needed to minimize on-site inventory and transportation risk.  The regulated SCR ammonia process is used only as a back-up and it uses 30% aqueous ammonia which is inherently safer than anhydrous ammonia, a commonly used alternative.  All applicable codes and standards were incorporated in"

On-site inventory was minimized and safety features were incorporated that go beyond industry standards including the remote controlled tank isolation valves, ammonia monitors, and a surveillance camera.\nA?    Operating procedures - Standard operating procedures and safe work practices are strictly followed.\nA?    Training - All CPSG technicians are qualified on applicable operating and maintenance procedures, safe work practices, and emergency response procedures.  A qualified emergency response HAZMAT team is present on-site at all times.  The drivers of the ammonia trucks are trained on the plant specific unloading and emergency response procedures.\nA?    Preventive maintenance - A preventive maintenance and inspection program has been developed to ensure the ongoing mechanical integrity of the system.\nA?    Change management - Change management procedures have been implemented to ensure proper materials of construction, safety evaluation, and updating of operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nAccident History\n\nThe Brandon Shores facility has never experienced a reportable release or accident associated with the storage or use of 30% aqueous ammonia.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBrandon Shores has a detailed Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan that includes specific emergency response procedures, procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies, and first aid and emergency medical treatment information for ammonia exposure.  The emergency response procedures have ben provided to the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) for distribution to the local emergency planning and response organizations as needed.  The local fire department has toured the facility many times and a comprehensive tour was provided for all local emergency response agencies on October 13, 2005.\n\nAll plant personnel are trained on emergency response procedures.  A fully qualified HAZMAT team is on-site at all times.  Emergency response drills are performed"
