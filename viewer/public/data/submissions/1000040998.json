The City's AWWTP processes wastewater from the City of Lancaster and portions of Manheim Township, Lancaster Township, East and West Lampeter Townships, Strasburg Borough, Strasburg Township, Upper Leacock Township, West Earl Township, Manor Township, Pequea Township, and East Hempfield Township. \n\n\n\nUpon collection and conveyance to the AWWTP, wastewater is physically treated through screening and primary clarification, in which inorganic and organic solids are removed.  Biological treatment of the wastewater follows primary clarification. The biological treatment of wastewater utilizing the OASES&reg; activated sludge process (anaerobic/oxic with anoxic stage inserted between oxic stages) further removes organic material as well as the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus.  Final clarification then separates the mixture of wastewater and active biological solids. The majority of biological solids are reused to treat incoming wastewater, but a portion of these solids are removed from the treatment process by reducing the water content, lime stabilizing for pathogen/vector reduction and then hauling off-site for beneficial reuse.  Chlorine and sodium bisulfite are used to disinfect and dechlorinate the wastewater respectively.  The rated hydraulic capacity of the AWWTP in 2013 was 32.08 million gallons per day (MGD). \n\n\n\nThe AWWTP is authorized to discharge treated wastewater to the Conestoga River under the terms of National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit No. PA 0026743.  It is well documented that the Chesapeake Bay is an ecologically sensitive area that is impacted greatly by nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen.  To ensure water quality protection, many actions have been taken within its waters"

A compliance audit is a way for you to evaluate and measure the effectiveness of your risk management program.  An audit reviews each of the prevention program elements to ensure that they are up-to-date and are being implemented and will help you identify problem areas and take corrective actions.\" (6-26)\n\n\n\nDuring the months of January 1999 to May 1999, the RMP for the Lancaster AWWTP was developed.  All information pertaining to the RMP was collected, organized, and revised.  The RMP for the AWWTP was again updated in June 2004 after April 2004 review.\n\n\n\nAll aspects of the fully developed RMP will be reevaluated every two years by supervisory staff knowledgeable in the chlorination process. \n\n\n\n\"You must keep a written record of audit findings and your response to those findings and documents that deficiencies have been corrected.  You must keep the two most recent audit reports, but you need not keep a report that is more than five years old.

      "SummaryText": ".\" (8-1)\n\n\n\nWhat is a response?\n\n\n\n\"EPA interprets \"response\" to be consistent with the definition of response specified under OSHA's HAZWOPER Standard.  OSHA defines emergency response as a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The key factor here is that responders are designated for such tasks by their employer.  This definition excludes responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release are, or by maintenance personnel as well as responses to releases of hazardous substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard (i.e., fire, explosion, or chemical exposure).  Thus, if you expect your employees to take action to end a small leak (e.g., shutting a valve) or clean up a spill that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard, this action could be considered an incidental response and you would not need to develop an emergency response program if your employees are limited to such activities.\" (8-2)\n\n\n\nDue to the fact that employees at the Lancaster AWWTP will only respond to small leaks that can be contained by shutting a valve, the AWWTP is not required to develop a detailed Emergency Response Program for RMP purposes.\n\n\n\nUnder the RMP requirements, the AWWTP is required to coordinate with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the facility.\n\n\n\nCoordination with local responders entails the following steps:\n\n\n\nA?  Ensure that you have set up a way to notify emergency responders when there is a need.\n\nB?  If you have a covered process with a regulated toxic, work with the local emergency planning entity to ensure that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan pre"
