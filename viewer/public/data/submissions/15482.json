Programs have been implemented to ensure that every effort is made to prevent the release of any chemical substance. The chemicals on site are stringently monitored to this end.\nIn the case of a release, programs are in place to alert the proper authorities as well as the proper responders in order to limit the effect of the release on the surrounding community.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated chemicals are;\n\nApperson Chemicals,Inc.\n817 West Roosevelt Ave.\nAlbany,GA 31701\n\n1.

With urban surroundings the endpoint would be 1.2 miles. This would be assuming a wind speed of 3.4mph with a stability class of \"F\" and an air temperature of 77 degrees F. There are no mitigation measures and no administrative controls included in this scenario.\nThe alternative scenario for Chlorine would be a release of 30# over a period of 15 minutes. The release rate would be 2# per.min.. With urban surroundings the endpoint would be .12 miles. This would be assuming a wind speed of 6.7 mph with a stability class of \"D\" and a temperature of 77 degrees F. There are no mitigation measures and no administrative controls included in this scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario for Hydrogen Flouride/Hydrofluoric acid 70% would be a 500# release over a period o 15 minutes.

There are no mitigation measures and no administrative controls included in this scenario.\n\nAll products are received in containers, either cylinders or drums,  these are unloaded at dock level and brought into the warehouse. In the case of Chlorine cylinders, they are inspected for integrity and leaks and placed onto pallets where they are secured together by airplane type ratchet straps which prevent any movement of the cylinders. The pallets are then transported to a ground level storage area outside of the building. While in storage they are checked daily for deterioration or leaks. When they are needed they are transported back inside the warehouse where they are inspected and then loaded onto trucks for the deliveries. Drummed products are received, shrink wrapped on high grade pallets  ,four to each pallet. The pallets are high grade and are supplied by the shipper. These drums are checked for integrity and leaks and if acceptable they are transported by fork lift to the storage area. All drummed products are stored no higher than two drums in height. Every effort is made to encourage our customer's to take only full pallets of product whenever possible which keeps the handling of individual drums to a minimum. While in stock the drums are checked daily for integrity and leakage. They are inspected again when they are loaded on the truck for delivery to our customer. The fork lifts used in the process of moving the drums or the cylinders about are kept on a regular maintenance program carried out by the manufacturer's representatives.
