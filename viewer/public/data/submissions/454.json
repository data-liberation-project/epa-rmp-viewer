THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF MINNKOTA FARMERS COOPERATIVE ARE COMMITED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE BALTIC FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIROMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n     ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 270,000 POUNDS IN OUR ONE 18,000 GALLON AND TWO 11,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS AND 19 NURSE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n     A. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASE AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WOULD BE 80,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .98 MILES.\n\n     B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n     THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS IN"

THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT:\n     HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY; NOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n     THE FACILITY HAS :\n\n\n     A. A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     B. PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n    \n     C.

PERIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS. THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME."
