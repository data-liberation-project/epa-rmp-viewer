No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified. By virtue of the flammable effects associated with liquefied petroleum gas, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling liquefied petroleum gas to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community along with the surrounding environment. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which liquefied petroleum gas is handled as well as the various safety/control devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Charlotte East Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via an injection skid and analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees Fahrenheit) fusible elements(fail safe), vessel multi-port pressure relief valves, 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shutoff devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Charlotte East Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nB.
