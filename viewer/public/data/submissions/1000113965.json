(MDU) Recovered Energy Generation (REG) facility (MDU CS-6) complies with numerous standards for pressure vessel design and testing as well as all Federal and North Dakota process safety management requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference. Regular inspection and testing of the pentane and thermal oil systems are performed to ensure equipment integrity is maintained. The facility is equipped with a network of leak detection equipment, automatic shutdown logic controls, insulation, safety relief valves, fire detection monitors. The facility will be operated by a contracted operator, Ormat Nevada, Inc. (Ormat). MDU/Ormat provide high levels of training in operating procedures, safety and emergency response. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency response procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the nearest fire department and request their assistance.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source\r\n\r\nThe power units are fueled by waste heat from a compressor turbine exhaust that is transferred from thermal energy into mechanical energy. This is accomplished by utilizing the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology. The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a Waste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat transfer fluid. The thermal oil is then circulated to the shell and tube vaporizer of an Ormat Energy Converter (OEC). The motive fluid on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive a special organic fluid turbine. This turbine, which rotates at 1800 rpm, drives a generato"

After exiting the various heat exchangers, the thermal oil passes through the thermal oil surge tanks and the thermal oil feed pumps, which discharge it into the WHOH. MDU will utilize the generated electricity through its own interconnection with the existing electrical transmission system.\r\n\r\nThe basic Rankine cycle model consists of four components:\r\n1.\tPump -Work Input\r\n2.\tBoiler -Heat Input\r\n3.\tTurbine -Work Output\r\n4.\tCondenser -Heat Rejection\r\n\r\nThe Rankine cycle consists of pressurizing a liquid (pentane), vaporizing the high pressure liquid, expanding the high pressure vapor and condensing the low pressure vapor for reuse. The energy necessary for the vaporization is provided by thermal oil at a maximum temperature of 572\u00b0F. The thermal energy is transferred to the pentane working fluid via tube and counter-current shell heat exchangers. The MDU CS-6 facility uses a commercial pentane with a dry cooling heat rejection system.\r\n\r\nPrimary Activities \r\n\r\nWaste thermal energy is converted to electric power. The net power output to the electrical grid is rated at 5.7 MW. Power output is reduced in warm weather due to limitations of the air-cooled heat exchangers.\r\n\r\nUse of Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as a binary working fluid. Liquid pentane is pumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. Thermal energy provided by thermal oil is transferred to the pentane. The thermal oil heat input causes the pentane to change physical states from liquid to high pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric power. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to complete the Rankine cycle. A pentane storage tank is available for makeup. The facility design is segregated into multiple sections, each having its own design spec"

This CMMS contains information on all equipment in the facility requiring maintenance, inspections, testing, certification, calibration, etc. NFPA, OSHA, manufacturer's recommendations and operations experience have been utilized to produce a comprehensive maintenance work order system that produces maintenance requests at appropriate frequencies. Employees report any equipment deficiencies to the operation and Maintenance Manager who generates \"work orders\" for the repair or assessment of the problem. Routine comprehensive inspections are performed using checklists.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan: The emergency response plan is intended to identify and coordinate personnel in the event there is an emergency.\r\n\r\nTraining: Some equipment in the MDU CS-6 facility poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include electrical safety, fire prevention and protection, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, gas detectors, fire pa"
