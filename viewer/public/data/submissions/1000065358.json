      "SummaryText": "Ohio Precious Metals, LLC (OPM), a wholly owned subsidiary of Elemetal, LLC, is a 168,000 square foot manufacturing facility located within the City of Jackson, in Jackson County, Ohio. OPM specializes in the refining of precious metal-bearing materials. \n\nOPM has two 'processes' that are regulated under 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Planning. Each is associated with one of OPM's gold refining processes.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2) is used as a raw material in the 'aqua regia' gold refining process. SO2, purchased in liquid form in 1-ton pressurized cylinders, is conveyed via a welded, heavy-wall steel piping system from an enclosed storage room to the 'gold room'.  After vaporization, SO2 is used in the 'SO2 kettles' and consumed in a chemical reaction, as one of the final steps in producing metal with a 99.99% purity.  OPM has completed a Program 3 RMP, which includes compliance with OSHA PSM. OPM's team of experienced process and maintenance staff performed the PHA using the FMEA procedure, supplemented by a checklist. Offsite consequence analysis was performed in accordance with US EPA guidance developed for wastewater treatment plants (where SO2 is purchased, stored and conveyed in a similar manner prior to a chemical reaction where it is consumed).  There is no history of accidental releases to the environment from OPM's aqua regia (SO2) process. \n\n\n\nChlorine (Cl2) is used as a raw material in the 'Miller' gold refining process. Cl2, purchased in liquid form in 1-ton pressurized cylinders, is conveyed via a welded, heavy-wall steel piping system from an enclosed storage room to the 'Miller room'.  Cl2 is introduced into molten gold-bearing material reacts with impurities, as the principal step in the Miller process, which produces metal with a ~96% purity.
