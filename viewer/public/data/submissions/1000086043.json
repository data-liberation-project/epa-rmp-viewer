This facility satisfies the definition of a Program 3 facility as found in 40 CFR Part 68.10(d), and is therefore required to generate and maintain an appropriate RMP. Plains LPG Services, L.P. (Plains) and its affiliated limited partnerships adhere to high standards of environmental quality and are committed to operating its facilities in a manner to protect the health and safety of its employees, the communities surrounding our facilities, and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response policy of Plains is to establish, maintain, and implement emergency response procedures when necessary with the prime objective of protecting the safety and health of its employees and the public and to mitigate to the greatest extent feasible the impact to the environment. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority in any emergency event. Only after life, safety, and environmental concerns are addressed will the secondary issues of property preservation and business recovery be addressed.\n\n\n\nThe facility is located at:\n\n5344 West M-80 Hwy\n\nKincheloe, Michigan 49788\n\n\n\nThe facility is in an industrial area near the Chippewa Airport complex. The facility is fenced and contains four (4) 30,000 USWG LPG storage vessels. A pump, compressors, meter and associated piping and valves are also a part of the facility.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe facility receives propane in rail cars, transfers the propane to four (4) pressurized 30,000 USWG propane tanks, and then ships the propane off with transport trucks. The only regulated substance at the facility site is Liquefied Petroleum Gas, LPG (Propane). There can be up to seventeen (17) rail cars at the facility, each with a capacity of 31,000 gallons. The terminal is classified as a Pro"

Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n?    Correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the terminal.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Kincheloe Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, as well as the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP). Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental releases.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Kincheloe Terminal within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Kinross Township Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the Chippewa County LEPC. The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the environmental,"

The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n?    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n?    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases\n\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the terminal include:\n\n?    Compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the terminal is periodically being evaluated for improvements.\n\n?    An ongoing dialogue with the Kinross Township Fire Department will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.\n\n\n\n"
