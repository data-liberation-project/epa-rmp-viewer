This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)  To save lives\n2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries\n3.)   To protect the environment\n4.)   To minimize property damage\n\nBirds Eye Foods maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organizations and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  The plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Birds Eye Foods Facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping , valves, and equipment , cycles ammonia through various physical states (High Pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (Cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum"

The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Operations level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team Members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.\n\nDuring the RMP review, It was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures.  In addition, it was recommended that the facility contact the local fire departemnt regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDuring the review of the Process Management Program at this facility, the Process Hazard Analysis study generated mitigation measures that"
