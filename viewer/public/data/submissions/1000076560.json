The refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a two stage evaporation/condensation cycle.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia related equipment could be divided into four sections.  \r\n1.\tThe ultra low pressure equipment contains (2) Ice Cream Freezer Evaporators, (1) Ultra Low Temp Pump Package (ULTPR), (1) Oil Pot and (1) Ultra Low Temp Booster Compressor.\r\n2.\tThe low pressure equipment contains (6) Freezer Evaporators, (1) Low Temp Pump Package (LTPR), (1) Oil Pot (1) and (3) Low Temp Booster Compressors.    \r\n3.\tThe intermediate pressure equipment contains (4) Meat Cooler Evaporators, (4) Dairy/Deli Evaporators, (2) 55deg Dry Produce Evaporators, (2) 55/34deg Dry Produce Evaporators, (2) 34deg Wet Produce Evaporators, (2) 45deg Dry Produce Evaporators, (14) 35deg Dock Evaporators, (10) Banana Room Evaporators, (1) High Temp Pump Package (HTPR), (1) Oil Pot, (3) High Stage Compressors, and (1) Swing Compressor.\r\n4.\tThe high-pressure equipment includes the (2) Evaporative Condensers and (1) Thermosyphon/High Pressure Receiver (TSHPR) and associated piping/valves.\r\n\r\nAmmonia refrigeration provides cooling by utilizing the heat input required to change a liquid to a vapor (latent heat of evaporation) and then heat output discharged when a gas collapses to form liquid (latent heat of condensation). 'Heat' is quantified by definition and is 'labeled' as calories or Btu (British Thermal Unit).  One Btu, by definition, equals the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water, 1 \u00baF when the water is 70 \u00baF, and at sea level pressure.  All other compounds reference this definition.  For example, the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of liquid ammonia at 70 \u00baF and 128.8 psia  = 1.129 Btu/lb (this is also referred to as the Specific Heat). The amount of heat required to vaporize 1 pound of ammonia (at a corr"

Therefore, a system is 500 times more efficient in heat transfer per pound of ammonia utilized if the system incorporates change of state: liquid boiling off forming a vapor.\r\n\r\nThis 'heat' must be removed from the system or the system would reach a point that no more 'heat' could be absorbed (e.g. the liquid evaporates, and now must be condensed).  This is accomplished by compressing the gas to a pressure such that Air/Water passing over the Condenser coils would accept heat from the gas.  The (vaporized) gas, in rejecting heat, condenses, and thus provides liquid to begin the cycle again.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia flow direction is based on pressure differences (either by gravity or forced) and by the difference in volume between a gas and a liquid containing the same amount of ammonia.  The active driver of this system is the compressor.\r\n\r\nThe evaporation/condensation cycle is as follows:\r\n\r\nUltra Low Pressure Suction\r\n\tAmmonia liquid is pumped from the Ultra Low Temp Pump Package (ULTPR) to the ultra low-temp evaporators where heat is absorbed from the rooms.  The liquid ammonia boils absorbing the room heat and is converted from a liquid to a vapor.  Not all of the liquid boils off.  The mixture of liquid and vapor then returns to the Ultra Low Temp Pump Package (ULTPR) where the liquid and vapor are separated so that the liquid can be circulated back to the evaporators.\r\n\r\n\tThe low-pressure vapor passes through the Ultra Low Temp Pump Package (ULTPR) and enters the Booster Compressor suction line.  In the Ultra Low Temp Booster Compressor, the vapor is compressed to a higher pressure.  In this case it is compressed to 31.4 PSIG.
