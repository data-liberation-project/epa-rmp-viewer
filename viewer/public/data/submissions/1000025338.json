The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Fresh and Easy ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  A refrigeration contractor performs all routine and preventative maintenance on the system.\r\n\r\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Fresh and Easy has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.

This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process solution equipment at the facility. \r\n\r\nFresh and Easy senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Fresh and Easy's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the EHS Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe system at 15555 Meridian Parkway in Riverside, California was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code, the Uniform Building Code, the Electrical Code, the California Fire Code, and the Uniform Fire Code at the time of construction.

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal Incident Investigation since system startup in 2008.

The initial Process Hazard Analysis was performed on April 28, 2008, a PHA Addendum was conducted on February 19, 2009, to cover an expansion in 2009, and the PHA Revalidation was performed on October 18, 2011.  The Fresh and Easy safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\r\n\r\nDATA ELEMENT NOTES\r\n\r\nItem n"
