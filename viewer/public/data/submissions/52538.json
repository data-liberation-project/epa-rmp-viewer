No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n5.  This facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Greene Fire Department, which is a member of the North Central Regional Emergency Planning District (North Central LEPC) in Iowa.  This program includes response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency operations plans and response procedures are reviewed annually, with a site visit of the"
