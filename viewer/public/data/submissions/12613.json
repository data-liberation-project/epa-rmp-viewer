THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF HEWITT BROTHERS, INC. ARE COMMITTED TO \n     THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL\n     RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY\n     OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE\n     TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     WE ARE AN AGRI BUSINESS COMPANY.  WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL ANIMAL FEEDS.  WE ALSO\n     SELL PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, SEEDS, FERTILIZER, CHEMICALS AND ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\n     -ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION FOR\n      CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n     -THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 84,000 POUNDS IN OUR 12,000 AND 8,000 GALLON\n      STORAGE TANKS, AND OUR 9  DELIVERY WAGONS.  THE MAXIMUM HANDLED WOULD BE THE\n      UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 36,000 POUNDS.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENERIO\n\n     A)  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS\n           OF OUR 12,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAX.\n           QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 51,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE \n           LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE\n           DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.79 MILES.\n\n     B)  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENERIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT\n           IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT\n           (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.56 MILES.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE \n     STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLIS"
