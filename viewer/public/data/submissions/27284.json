Facility Policy.\n\n   The owner, management, and employees of Golden Furrow - Davis Co., Inc.are committed to the    prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Davis County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n   The primary activity at the facility is the storage fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is\nreceived, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximun\nquantity stored would be 420,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n a.       The worse-case scenario would be the release of total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 min. The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative control.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.6 miles.\n \n b.       The alternate release scenario, a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .30 miles (the most likely potential incident from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia would be the matter of seconds).\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n   The facility is in compliance with the p"

(ANSI),  and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"   The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused\nany deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, has there been\nany accidental releases resulting on off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or \nenvironmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe facility has:\na.    A written action plan,  in accourdance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n \nb.    Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n    information as required under SARA Tiltle III (EPCRA);\n \nc.    If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.  With-in 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator   will notify:\n       \n    1.  The National Emergency Response Center at 800/424-8802\n\nd.   Any releases in Iowa should be reported to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources at 515/281-8694.\n\n\n7. Planned Chages to Improve Safety.\n\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions at Golden Furrow - Davis Co., Inc.  There are no additional specific safety\nrecommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
