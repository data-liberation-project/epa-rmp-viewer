As part\nof  this commitment, CFS has established a system to help  ensure\nsafe  operation of the processes at this facility.  One component\nof  this system is a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that helps manage\nthe  risks at CFS and that complies with the requirements of  the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR  part\n68,  Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk  Management\nPrograms (the RMP rule).\n\nOne  of  the  requirements of the RMP rule is to  submit  a  risk\nmanagement  plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management  program\nat  CFS.   This  document  is  intended  to  satisfy  the  RMPlan\nrequirement  of  the RMP rule and to provide the  public  with  a\ndescription of the risk management program at CFS.\n\nThe RMP program at CFS consists of three (3) elements:\n1)   A hazard assessment to help understand:\n\n               The potential offsite consequences of hypothetical\n               accidental releases and;\n          l    accidents that have occurred during the last five (5) years\n               associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule\n               (regulated substances).\n          \n2)   A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the\n     processes  containing more than a threshold  quantity  of  a\n     regulated substance (covered processes).\n3)   An  emergency response program to help respond to accidental\n     releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this\nRMPlan.\n\nAlthough the RMP program at CFS helps provide assurance that  the\nfacility is maintained "

Before  using  a\nhazardous  substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.\nWhen a hazardous substance is used at CFS, consideration is given\nto  the  potential  for  this substance to adversely  affect  CFS\nworkers,  the public, and the environment and CFS takes steps  to\nprevent any such effects.\n\nCFS  prevents releases of the hazardous substances  used  at  the\nfacility.   When  a  hazardous substance  is  used  at  CFS,  the\nequipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the\nlikelihood  of  an accidental release.  Industry  and  government\nstandards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and\noperation of the equipment.\n\nCFS  limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  CFS\ntrains workers to respond to an emergency response, reducing  the\nconsequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition,  CFS  works\nwith  the  local  fire  department and with the  local  emergency\nplanning  committee  (LEPC) to limit injuries  and  environmental\ndamage if a release does occur.\n\nThe  safety program at CFS consists of a number of elements, many\nof  which  are  required by the RMP rule.

Minimal effects could occur at the endpoint\ndistance.   At  distances  less than the endpoint  distance,  the\neffects  would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint\ndistance, the effect would be less.\n\nThe  RMP  rule includes specific requirements for the  worst-case\nand  alternative  release scenarios that  must  be  reported  for\nProgram  3  processes.
