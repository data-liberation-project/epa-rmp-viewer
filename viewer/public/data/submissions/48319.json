The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of UAP Distribtion, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information - UAP Distribution, Inc, 2nd Street, Tipton, Kansas  67485 (785) 373-4445.  The ammonia storage tank is located approximately 1/4 mile North on 2nd Street on the East side of the road.  Ammonia nurse trailers are occasionally stored at the facility office at 206 Washington.\n\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored at the parking area would be 164,000 pounds, composed of 12, 1000 gallon nurse trailers and up to a maximum of 10, 1500 gallon nurse trailers.\n\nOperating procedures for an emergency situation, unloading at a storage facility, and loading of ammonia nurse trailers have been updated as of 03/08/2007.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of one of the larger, 1500 gallon nurse trailers, po"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29  CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves, installation of a bulkhead at the truck unloading point, and remote shut-offs for the storage tank(s).  The Company has adopted a plan to bring all facilities and equipment into compliance with the full ANSI standards by the end of 2004.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n   \n6.
