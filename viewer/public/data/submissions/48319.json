The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29  CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves, installation of a bulkhead at the truck unloading point, and remote shut-offs for the storage tank(s).  The Company has adopted a plan to bring all facilities and equipment into compliance with the full ANSI standards by the end of 2004.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n   \n6.
