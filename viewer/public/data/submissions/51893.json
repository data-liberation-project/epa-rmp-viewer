The site is among the largest silicon wafer \nmanufacturing plants in the world, located on 200 acres and employing 900 people.\n\nThe process consists of melting pure silicon into single crystals, then slicing these into wafers, \nplanarizing them to perfect flatness, and polishing them to a perfect finish in a cleanroom \nenvironment.  Some wafers receive an additional coating, in the form of an epitaxial layer that \ngi"

These PSM-regulated gases are \nhydrogen, hydrogen chloride, and trichlorosilane.  These are the same three substances \nregulated under EPA?s Risk Management Plan as well.\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155?\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMEMC accidental release prevention is based on the Process Safety Management standard.  \nThe three regulated RMP chemicals identified above are managed under PSM.  Elements of the \nPSM program include evergreen and actively maintained written operating procedures that are \nfollowed by trained and knowledgeable technicians.\n\nOver time, MEMC has built a detailed collection of process safety procedures to insure \nstandardized chemical handling and usage. The procedures begin with a safety section to \nreinforce the main theme of \"Safety First\".  Management Of Change is formally controlled in \ncovered processes to ensure no unauthorized changes occur.  Job Safety Analyses or Risk \nAssessments are also used as applicable, to identify hazards and control risks.  These are step-\nby-step reviews of tasks to ensure these jobs are done according to the safety standard.\n\nPrevention steps include:\n?+ Tank and vessel inspection program to check mechanical integrity\n?+ Safety relief valve test program to ensure equipment functions as designed\n?+ Process Line Entry Permit for servicing piping and equipment and returning it to service\n?+ Hot Work Permits, Fire Prevention Plans, and related procedures\n?+ Sprinkler systems and firewalls to minimize the threat of fire or explosion\n\nMEMC measures the Serious Incident Rate for the plant each month, to include all accidents \nand incidents and potential incidents, not simply injuries.  Those classified Serious Incidents are \nthoroughly investigated according to a s"

Safety suggestions and safety work order programs provide all employees with \nthe opportunity to participate in finding and reporting barriers to safety.\n\nMEMC uses a formal Chemical Registration process that will not allow any new chemical \nsubstance in the plant unless it has received proper review for safe use, storage, and eventual \ndisposal.  Chemical usage is tracked by month, by chemical, by department.\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(d)\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin five years of the date of this revision, there have been no releases of any regulated \nsubstance held above the threshold quantity from a covered process.\n\nSo there is no information available about deaths, injuries, property damages, environmental \ndamages, evacuations, or sheltering in place, because none of these occurred in the five-year \nperiod.\n\nAlso, none have occurred during the 47 years the facility has been in operation.\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(e)\nEmergency Response Program \n\nAll employees are trained to dial the Plant Emergency Hotline from any plant telephone in case of \na chemical release, fire, or medical emergency of any kind.  That emergency number is also \nposted on all plant telephones.  The Hotline and the plant's emergency alarms go to the security \ndesk in the main lobby.  The security officers activate the site Emergency Response Team paging \nsystem and will summon other plant resources, including Central County Fire and Rescue when \nneeded.\n\nThe response is handled by the plant's Emergency Response Team, and Central County Fire and \nRescue when necessary.  MEMC ERT members are 40-hour HazWoper trained and given \nrefresher training annually.  Emergency Medical Responder training has also been provided. \nPeriodically, MEMC?s ERT and Central County Fire and Rescue review emergency responses \nand plans, and conduct joint training exercises.\n \nIn the event of an emergency with off-site consequences, MEMC would work with Centra"
