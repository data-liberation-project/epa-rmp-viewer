BETTS FILTER PLANT\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \nAND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\nChlorine 1-ton cylinders are stored in a room designed specifically for chlorine.  The room has chlorine detectors that are serviced annually and are part of the training program for all employees.  The detectors are linked to a discharge system which carries escaping gas through a scrubber that removes the harmful chlorine gas and discharges clean air to the atmosphere.  The scrubber is controlled automatically with no need for human interaction.  The scrubber is supplied with back up power from an onsite generator that comes on automatically should a power outage occur.  The detectors are also connected to a warning system which intermittently sounds a warning horn and flashes a red warning light. \n\nEach employee is trained on the proper methods for removing empty cylinders and replacing them with full cylinders.  We use the \"buddy system\" any time we connect to or disconnect tubing from the cylinders.  We do not allow one person to be alone at any time during any procedure that might cause chlorine gas to leak or be released.  \n-Every valve is closed from the cylinder outward so that the chlorine gas supply will be shut off in every piece of supply tubing.\n-As the operator loosens the valve, he does it slowly so that he can retighten it quickly if there is gas present.  \n-The valve facings are cleaned before being attached to another cylinder and a lead gasket is placed between the yoke valve and the cylinder valve.  \n-The cylinder valve is opened slightly and re-closed.  \n*Ammonia gas is used to check for leaks.  Ammonia vapors make a white smoke when they come in contact with chlorine vapors.\n-If no leak is present, each valve is opened and closed in succession, being checked with ammonia gas for leaks.  \n-If there are no leaks, the cylinder is placed in service or in standby.  The operator then logs the date, time, personnel in attendance, "

BETTS FILTER PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe Robert A. Betts Filter Plant is a water treatment and filtration facility.  We take water from Lake Harding in its natural state and treat it to make it potable.  We take pride in the quality of the water that we deliver to our customers as well as the low impact that our facility makes on our surrounding environment.\n\nThe process of water treatment, in simple terms, is the addition of a substance called a coagulant to change the electrical charge of the water so we can form a heavier substance that will envelope undesirable elements and fall to the bottom of a basin designed for settling.\n\nOne of the processes we use is a disinfection process.  Water-borne diseases, bacteria, viruses, and cysts can live and grow in water so we disinfect to kill these undesirables.  The disinfectant we use is chlorine.  Chlorine will kill almost any living creature and therefore, is a very effective disinfectant.\n\nBecause chlorine can be so deadly, we take great care in how we handle and store chlorine.  Chlorine is shipped to us on flat-bed trucks.  The trucks carry cylinders that hold 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine.  Each container has been thoroughly inspected and certified by the chemical manufacturer before it was filled with chlorine. We normally would have no more than four full cylinders on hand at any one time.\nThe chlorine takes the form of gas in the upper parts of the cylinders and that is what we use to mix with water to create a chlorine disinfecting dose to add to the water.\nWe store the cylinders in a room that was specially designed to house the cylinders.  Every precaution has been taken to insure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community.  \n\nTHE WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nChlorine gas can be deadl"
