Refrigeration contractors and facility technicians are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. Refrigeration engine room has emergency shut off switches outside the engine room doors that can shut down the system without entering the engine room. Control system also initiates emergency exhaust fan in case of high ammonia levels and shuts down the system automatically if the ammonia concentration level in engine room reaches the high set level. The facility has also installed ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and engine room. Personnel are notified in case of an ammonia leak. Monitoring is 24 hours per day. The relief valves in the system are all tied into the diffusion tank.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Lakeside Organic Gardens personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. RMP Program Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency action plan and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. RMP Program Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. Description of the emergency action plan is included Chapter 20 of the RMP Binder.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accident"

(Main System) completely sealed and pressurized within the system.\n\nRefrigeration system drawings are located in the Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 (Refrigeration System Drawings) of the RMP Binder. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder, describe equipment details. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nLakeside Organic Gardens maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix 16 - Incident Investigation of the RMP Binder.\n\nLakeside Organic Gardens is a Non-Responding facility. Facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to Facility Mana"

The trailer is operated as a standalone ammonia refrigeration system. Total ammonia charge is approximately 2,000 lb. Ice maker trailer is composed of the following equipment: one screw compressor w/ oil separator, one evaporative condenser, one low-pressure receiver with an ammonia pump, ice making plates, control system, and related piping & valves. Process hazard analysis was conducted on March 21, 2022, before charging the refrigeration system with ammonia. Ice maker trailer will stay on site all the time. Ice maker trailer refrigeration equipment, and associated piping and valves are located outdoors.\n\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of emergency situation or any high pressure, high temp or ammonia detection. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nLakeside Organic Gardens conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Lakeside Organic Gardens facility acts as a stationary source for regulated substance anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia system is used for cold storage, vacuum cooling, and hydrocooling operations. The facility operates throughout the year as produce precooling and cold storage facility. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 of the RMP binder for the drawings showing the facility location map and site plan.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards in 2017 as part of the newly constructed Lakeside Organic Gardens facility.
