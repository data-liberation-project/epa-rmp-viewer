      "SummaryText": "MillerCoors LLC is committed to promoting a safe working environment and has developed and implemented several programs to ensure chemical safety.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration process and has several methods for ensuring employee and public safety associated with this process.  The facility has developed procedures, plans and policies for the operation of the ammonia process and for dealing with unexpected accidental releases. MillerCoors LLC has implemented a process safety management program which enhances safety by regular maintenance and inspections, hazard analysis and other activities.  The MillerCoors facility has an Emergency Response Team and a Utilities Response Team complete with state-of-the-art emergency response equipment.  Both teams are trained to quickly and effectively respond to a release of hazardous materials.  The facility also has emergency response procedures and plans to promote chemical safety in the event of an emergency situation. At this time the facility has no changes planned to improve safety.\n\nMillerCoors is engaged in the beer production business.  As part of the brewing process an ammonia refrigeration system is utilized.  Due to the quantity of ammonia maintained on-site the facility is subject to the Risk Management Program regulations which are meant to promote safety at the facility and general public level.\n\nA worst-case release scenario was modeled to determine the greatest impact a release of ammonia from the facility could reasonably cause.  This scenario is based on a complete and total release of ammonia from the largest ammonia vessel located at the facility.  At the MillerCoors facility, this scenario involves a vessel which has an administratively controlled capacity of 59,931 pounds of ammonia (company policy limits the filling of the vessel to 80% of its total capacity).  The worst-case release of ammonia from this vessel is a complete loss of all 59,931 pounds of ammonia in a ten minute period.  C"

      "SummaryText": "omputer modeling was used to reasonably evaluate impacts from such a release.  The modeling indicates that impacts from the worst case release would impact public receptors beyond the property boundaries.  The vessel is located outside and the building will not mitigate the release due.\n\nAn Alternative release scenario was also modeled using the EPA lookup tables.  The alternative release scenario is based on a liquid release from a 0.25 diameter orifice at 160 psig for 60 minutes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a scenario which is more likely to occur that the worst-case scenario.  Based on the modeling it was determined that such a leak could result in impacts to the public receptors beyond the property boundaries.\n\nIn the previous five years, the MillerCoors Facility has not had any accidental releases which resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage from the ammonia process.\n\nThe MillerCoors Facility is also subject to the process Safety Management regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  As a result of these regulations, the MillerCoors facility has implemented a program to further enhance process safety which involves operation procedures, training, mechanical integrity (maintenance related issues), pre-start-up-review, management of change, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work (welding) permits, and contractor safety.\n\nThe facility's emergency response program consists of three major plans/procedures:  an Emergency Action Plan, an Emergency Contingency Plan and Standard Operating Procedures for Emergency Responders (SOPER) that is part of the Process Safety Management Plan.\n\nThe emergency response plans/procedures at the MillerCoors facility contain information and procedures relative to initial response, informing the public, evacuation, f"

Both teams receive extensive annual training to deal with accidental release at the facility.  Equipment used by the teams are routinely tested and maintained.\n\nThe emergency response plan for the facility has been submitted to and approved by the Tarrant County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC.) Annually the Fort Worth Fire Department conducts a Fire Safety Inspection of the brewery and participates in a brewery tour."
