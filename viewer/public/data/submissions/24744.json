This facility has mechanisms in place as identified in \"Emergency Action Plan\" to address releases of sulfur dioxide.  Designated facility personnel have received required OSHA training to respond to a sulfur dioxide release.  If an emergency were to occur (I.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility is a repackager of bulk sulfur dioxide.  A maximum of 150,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide may be on site in repackaged containers.  The sulfur dioxide storage trailer has a maximum capacity of 46,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  Thus, the total facility capacity is approximately 196,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of the sulfur dioxide trailer or piping when it has its maximum intended inventory of 46,000 pounds, resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance to a 0.0078 mg/l sulfur dioxide toxic endpoint is 7.0 miles and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a 1/4\" effective diameter orifice leak (representative of releases from piping failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seats and drains or bleeds that lead to an airborne release.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site to a distance of 0.2 mile.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The sulfur dioxide system is"

Designated response personnel and procedures are identified in written plans entitled \"Emergency Action Plan\" and \"Process Safety Management Sulfur Dioxide System\".  These personnel have received necessary response operations training in accordance with applicable OSHA regulations.  Designated personnel will also perform required external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Response Comission, Local Emergency Planning Committee).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the sulfur dioxide system."
