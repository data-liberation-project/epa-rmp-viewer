The emergency procedures cover all components of an emergency including facility shutdown, alerting local emergency services, and evacuation. In the event of an emergency, the typical response would be through 911. Terminal personnel or emergency responders may contact CHEMTREC to request information and recommendations for emergency response measures.  The emergency response plans have been coordinated with the fire department; members of the Fire Department have visited the propane facility and have reviewed the safety systems in place. The Fire Department has been given a map showing the public receptors within the hazard distance in the event of an evacuation exercise.  Emergency response equipment is inspected and tested regularly to ensure proper function.  The emergency response procedures are re-evaluated on a regular basis, as well as tested annually.\r\nOperational and process safety systems:  The facility has been designed with failsafe systems and practices to mitigate the severity of any incident involving propane.  These safety systems and practices include:\r\n\u00bf\tRestricted access: transport loading area and storage tanks are contained within a fenced compound. The transport loading area includes pad-locked man-gates and motorized ingress/egress gates. Drivers are pre-authorized to access the facility upon completing site specific emergency preparedness training hosted by terminal personnel.

The facility complies with the NFPA 58-2011 requirements for LP-Gas storage facilities as adopted by the Indiana State Register. Additionally, the facility complies with applicable federal and local laws with respect to the safe handling of propane. The facility meets the requirements of the codes and laws with its practices and design to ensure there is minimal risk of an accidental release. If an emergency were to occur, procedures are in place to notify the local Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. The terminal is registered with CHEMTREC an emergency call center that provides information and assistance in the event of an emergency. There is also a 24-hour company emergency number that can assist with coordinating emergency responders and recommend courses of action in emergency scenarios.\r\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  The Mentone Propane Company terminal is a wholesale propane distribution terminal for storage and distribution of propane to local propane marketers. The facility's permanent storage consists of two 60,000-gallon tanks and two 30,000-gallon tanks with associated loading and unloading equipment. Additionally, there is one 500-gallon tank used for building heating and one 334-gallon tank used for compressor liquid trap evacuation. Propane (UN 1075) is classified as a flammable gas. Typically, propane is received in rail tank cars that are unloaded at the facility using compressors. And if necessary, propane can be offloaded from cargo liners using on-board pumps. Propane is loaded into customer truck transports or company bobtail trucks using the facility's pumping and metering equipment.\r\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EP"

The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Equation C-1 from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis was used to determine the hazard distance for the worst case scenario for determination of the public receptors. The alternative release scenario, as determined by the Potential Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (PFMEA) a quantitative study of all potential hazards, is a vehicular accident caused by driver error resulting  in breaking a section of pipe, and creating a vapour cloud that ignites after a short time. The team performing the PFMEA consisted of a group of management and engineers with experience in the design, operation, and maintenance of propane facilities.  \r\nAs well, a third party engineering company has conducted a quantitative risk assessment and layer of protection analysis of the worst case and alternative case scenarios. The analyses determined that the location risk for each of the public receptors were acceptable according to the 2008 modified Major Industrial Accidents Council of Canada (MIACC) Guidelines created by the Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering, Process Safety Management Division for risk acceptability criteria. The MIACC guidelines are acceptable risk criteria published in numerous jurisdictions including the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Australia, and Canada. \r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  The facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule as per 40 CFR Part 68, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
