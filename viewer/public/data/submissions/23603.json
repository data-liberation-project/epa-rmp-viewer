The owners, management, and employees of the Radium Branch are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work and assist the local emergency respose authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and enviroment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION.  The facility is located on the west side of Radium Kansas. The primary activity at this location is storage for grain, chemicals, and fertilizers. Chemicals and fertilizers are stored for retail sale to producers of agricultural products. The maxium storage capacity of anhyrous ammonia at this location is 388,500 pounds, which includes storage tanks and portable nurse tanks.\n\n3. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO. The worts case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the bulk storage tanks. The maxium release would be 159,000 pounds, the distance to end point would be 2.0 with approximately 102 people affected.\n\n4. ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO. The alternate release scenario is a release from a ruptured transfer hose. The release of approximatley 2400 pounds would travel 0.3 miles and affect about 52 people. The population of Radium Kansas is around 45 people.\n\n5. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM. The Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries \"AG-21\" member. AG-21 is aprogram that is enviromental driven. this Coop strives to go above and beyond industry standards for the safety of customer, employee, and the enviroment.\n\n6. FIVE YEAR ACCIDIENT HISTORY. There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia withen  the past five years at this facility.\n\n7. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM. The facility has coordinated with local responders.\n\n8. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY. The Coop's Safety Committee which is comprised of a representative from each Department and Branch. This committee tours a Branch or de"
