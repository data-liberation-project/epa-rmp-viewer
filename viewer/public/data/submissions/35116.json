It is the companies' goal to maintain a safe and productive operation for the benefit of the employees and the community.  This is accomplished by safety committee\u00bfs, employee suggestions, monitoring devices, established safety procedures and guidelines and chemical specific training.  If management becomes aware of an issue that jeopardizes safety, plans will be implemented to correct this problem in a timely manner.\n\nFacility Description\n\nM.C. Aluminum America is a Secondary Aluminum Smelter S.I.C. 3341.  Our process involves the receiving of many types of aluminum scrap.  Much of the scrap we receive is aluminum turning chips that contain oils and cutting fluids.  The turning chips are dried in any of 2 rotary kiln dryers.  The dried turning chips along with other aluminum scrap are melted in any of 3 reverberatory furnaces.  After a furnace is full, samples are taken to insure that all elements are within customer required specifications.  \n\nIn 1 of the 3 furnaces we perodically inject chlorine to reduce the magnesium content as requested by some of our customers.  We inject chlorine at a maximum rate of 100 lb an hour.  On average we inject a total of 200 lb of chlorine when required.  It takes approximately 16 hours to produce I lot and we produce an average of 10 lots per month that require the use of chlorine.  This equals an average of 2000 lb of chlorine used per month and the total time that chlorine is in use averages out to 20 hours a month in 2 hour increments.  To accommodate this usage we maintain approximately 3000 lb of chlorine on site.  The chlorine is stored in 2, 1 ton containers in an enclosed cement block building behind the main production building.  The entire facility is also enclosed within a fence that is closed and locked after normal buisness hours.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release\n\nGeneral accidents are a possibility, however by f"

The following, lists our most important factors for this belief;\n\n\u00b7 Only trained and competent operators are authorized to operate the chlorine process or even enter the chlorine building\n\u00b7 Each time a new container of chlorine arrives and is connected to the system all new seals and gaskets are used \n\u00b7 Each time prior to using chlorine, a leak test is conducted of the system\n\u00b7 After using chlorine each time the system is completely emptied so there is not any remaining chlorine in the system other than that in the container\n\u00b7 A chlorine emergency shutoff system is used at the valve of the container.  This shutoff system can be activated at any station throughout the process by pressing an emergency stop button.  The system will also automatically close the container if our monitoring system detects a leak.  This shutoff system has a battery backup.\n\u00b7 If the system is activated, the flow of chlorine is stopped within 1.5 seconds\n\u00b7 Our chlorine system is not used during weather which may impact the safety of our operation, i.e.  thunderstorms or something that would terminate the electricity.\n\nFive year accident history\n \nWe are pleased to announce that we have not had a release in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWe have an emergency response program that that has been established under the guidelines set by OSHA and enhanced using the guidelines set forth by RMP.  The program address\u00bfs the recognition of a chlorine release that warrants the activation of our emergency response plan.  The response plan explains the safe and swift removal of all non-essential personnel to a safe place of refuge were all can be accounted for.\n\nThe LEPC is our liaison for the hospital, police, sheriff's department a"

The police will provide security, the fire department will provide support services such as decontamination, medical support, medical transportation.  The LEPC and the fire department are notified of any changes at our facility that might in any way impact the outcome of an emergency response action at our facility. \n\nThe members of our emergency response team are chosen because of their thorough knowledge of the chlorine system which is obtained from the position that each member holds at the company.\n\nResponse training includes;  chlorine system operations and limitations, recognizing the hazards of chlorine and how to use the proper PPE and the limitations of the PPE  when handling chlorine in an emergency operation, proper procedures and equipment to contain and stop a chlorine release, how to administer first aid procedures to those exposed to chlorine and perform the proper decontamination procedures, members will also know what is not compatible with chlorine.\n\nTraining will be conducted at least annually and will include classroom and hands on type training using all equipment that would be used during an actual chlorine release response.  At the completion of all training a critique is done as would in an actual emergency.\n      \nPlanned changes\n\nWe are always looking for ways to improve the safety of our operation and will continue to follow and build upon the existing practices and policies already in place."
