      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\nIntroduction\r\n      The Tahoe-Truckee Sanitation Agency (T-TSA) is a regional water reclamation facility located in Martis Valley, approximately three miles east of downtown Truckee, California.  The physical address of the facility is 13720 Joerger Drive, Truckee, California.  T-TSA was formed in 1972 to provide tertiary wastewater treatment for Tahoe City Public Utility District, North Tahoe Public Utility District, Squaw Valley Public Services District, Alpine Springs County Water District, and Truckee Sanitary District.  The regional water reclamation plant became operational in 1978, was expanded in 1982, and again in 2006.  The current capacity of the treatment system is 9.6 million gallons per day of raw sewage.  The plant operates continuously and is attended 24 hours per day.\r\n      T-TSA owns and operates a chlorine process that is subject to Program 3 of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program because the following conditions apply: (1) the chlorine process maximum inventory (32,000 lbs.) exceeds the 2,500 pound threshold quantity, (2) the chlorine process has a Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 2812, and (3) the chlorine process is subject to the federal and state Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA and CalOSHA) process safety management standards of Section 1910.119 of Title 29 of CFR and Section 5189 of Title 8 of CCR.  The Program 3 requirements are as follows: (1) develop and implement a management system as provided in Section 2735.6 (CalARP Management), (2) conduct a hazard assessment as provided in Sections 2750.1 through 2750.9 (Hazard Assessment), (3) implement the prevention requirements of Sections 2760.1 through 2760.12 (Program 3 Prevention Program), (4) submit as part of the RMP the data on the prevention program elements for Program 3 processes as provided in Section 2745.7 (Program 3 Prevention Program Data), and (5) develop and implement an emergency response program as provided i"

T-TSA has developed, implemented, and integrated an extensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program that includes the following elements:\r\n* Process Safety Information,\r\n* Process Hazard Analysis (PHA),\r\n* Operating Procedures,\r\n* Training,\r\n* Contractors,\r\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review,\r\n* Mechanical Integrity,\r\n* Hot Work Permit,\r\n* Management of Change,\r\n* Incident Investigation,\r\n* Emergency Planning and Response,\r\n* Injury & Illness Prevention Program, and\r\n* Employee Participation.\r\n   \r\n      In addition to the PSM, T-TSA submitted an original Risk Management Plan (RMP) in June 1999.  The RMP superseded the original Risk Management and Prevention Plan (RMPP) approved in 1996.  Other safety and health programs employed at T-TSA include the Business Plan, and the hazardous waste manifests for the California EPA, Department of Toxic Substances Control (EPA ID No: CAL000003215).  The Business Plan is administered by T-TSA?s Certified Unified Permitting Authority (CUPA), the Nevada County Department of Environmental Health (DEH).  The Business Plan is a working document that includes the following elements:\r\n* Facility Maps,\r\n* Hazardous Materials Inventory Statement,\r\n* Emergency Response Plan,\r\n* Mitigation Measures,\r\n* Evacuation Plan,\r\n* Training Plans and Procedures,\r\n* Pre-Response Plans, and \r\n* Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all the materials handled and stored at the facility. \r\n       \r\n\tAn original Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) invol"

      "SummaryText": "ving a Hazard and Operability Study (HazOp) and What-If Analysis was conducted with design engineers, operations staff, management personnel, and maintenance staff prior to the design of the chlorine process.  Subsequent PHA Revalidation Reports were completed in July 2001 and April 2006.  Release prevention measures were implemented during the design and construction of the facility, thus ensuring that all safety and health precautions were integrated into the system prior to operation.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled at T-TSA\r\n      Chlorine is the only regulated substance present at T-TSA?s facility that is above the threshold quantity pursuant to Section 112 (r) (5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and listed in 40 CFR 68130.  The maximum compressed liquid chlorine inventory at T-TSA is 32,000 pounds, or sixteen one-ton containers, that are arranged as follows: four one-ton containers on-line, four one-ton containers setup in standby mode, and eight one-ton containers in storage.  A common delivery manifold serves the on-line containers.  \r\n      Pressurized chlorine is reduced to vacuum pressure via vacuum regulators in the chlorine storage area.  Four chlorinators are available for use to meter the chlorine to downstream ejectors which feed a bank of chlorine solution lines.  The primary use of the chlorine solution is for injection into the plant's effluent flow for disinfection.  Chlorine solution is injected into the plant effluent 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Chlorine solution can also be used to pre-chlorinate raw sewage, chlorinate filters, breakpoint chlorinate for ammonia removal, and chlorinate the biological treatment process.  The maximum injection capacity is 3,200 pounds of chlorine per day.  Typically, only 500 to 1,000 pounds per day are used.  \r\n      The chlorine handling facility at T-TSA is a fully contained facility.  All storage and use of the one-ton chlorine containers is done within the container storage room.  The chlorine buil"

Upon detection of chlorine, the detectors activate two visual beacons located on the west and north sides of the chlorine building, one annunciator light and an audible alarm in the AWT building control room, and a plant-wide audible chlorine leak alarm.  Simultaneously, the leak detector initiates the shutdown of all ventilation fans, the shutdown of the chlorine solution pump, the initiation of the chlorine scrubber system, and the activation of the chlorine container valve closure system. This chlorine leak prevention system ensures minimal risk of offsite consequences from a chlorine leak at the facility.  The chlorine building is also equipped with an additional multi-probe chlorine detector that senses chlorine concentrations in four locations within the building and transmits this information to the plant?s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.\r\n      As required for the purposes of the RMP Program and the CalARP Program, a worst-case release scenario and an alternative-case release scenario were evaluated.  Pursuant to EPA?s recommendations, a description of the release scenarios is not provided because of potential security risks.\r\n      \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Measures\r\n      T-TSA is subject to the CalOSHA-regulated PSM Program and the RMP Program regulated by the EPA and by Nevada County DEH as part of the CalARP program.  These regulations help ensure that T-TSA maintains process safety and risk prevention programs for chlorine handling, storage, and use.
