This facility is known as the Alloys Plant or Constellium and is located at 4805 Second Street. The rolling mill facility consists of a plant which manufactures bare and coated aluminum coil. Reynolds Metals Company built the facility in 1941.  It was purchased by Constellium Muscle Shoals LLC in January 2015 from Wise Alloys LLC. This facility is one of the largest in the world of its kind and has processes including aluminum casting, hot rolling, cold rolling, annealing, coil coating, slitting, leveling, packing, shipping and storage. The facility employs 1263 full-time employees. \r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices at the Stationary Source (68.155(a))\r\n\r\nConstellium is committed to operating the Alloys Plant in a manner that is safe for workers, the public and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices. As part of this commitment, the Alloys Plant has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes of this facility which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risk at the Alloys Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and OSHA 1910.119. The document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP -rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Alloys Plant. \r\n\r\nThe RMP at the Alloys Plant consists of the following three elements: \r\nA\u00b7\tA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that ha"

In fact, the Alloys Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release. \r\n\r\nConstellium policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Alloys Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Alloys Plant, Constellium reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects. This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes. \r\n\r\nConstellium strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. Constellium implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Alloys Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.

In addition, Constellium requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. The Alloys Plant's Mechanical Integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances. \r\nThe Alloys Plant's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release. In the event of an accidental release the Alloys Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent' impact to the public and the environment. Constellium utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. Constellium trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. The Alloys Plant also has designated Gate 5 as a Special Situations Center to assist in all emergencies. In addition, Constellium works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur. Constellium has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Colbert County Community Awareness and Emergency Plan (CAER). \r\n\r\nThe Alloys Plant emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, and EPA regulations. This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Alloys Plant. If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities, the Colbert County Community Awareness and Emergency Plan (CAER) is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency. \r\n\r\nConstellium is an active participant in the community: Co"

The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternate release scenario.\" In reality, however, Constellium Muscle Shoals LLC does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. The alternative release scenarios are developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan. \r\n\r\nThe RMP*COMPA\u00bf system was used to calculate a distance to the toxic endpoint. The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst case and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario. The EPA recommended Landview program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within the circle of any release scenarios. USGS maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within any release circle. \r\n\r\n4.
