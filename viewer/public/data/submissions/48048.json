The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes and other public receptors are located within this 0.5 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Siouxland Ethanol has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nSiouxland Ethanol has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances on-site.  There have been no accidents since the establishment of Siouxland Ethanol.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nSiouxland Ethanol has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response; including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Siouxland Ethanol 's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safety - which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."

      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nSiouxland Ethanol, LLC\n\nSiouxland Ethanol, LLC is a newly constructed facility.  Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed.  Given that Siouxland Ethanol is a new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information prior to the start up of the facility.  On the same note, there has never been a change in management.  The management is new and therefore, the new management was implemented with the construction of the facility. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nSiouxland Ethanol  has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nSiouxland Ethanol\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Siouxland Ethanol facility is located in Jackson, Dakota County, Nebraska.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  Siouxland Ethanol has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 5.6 miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.5 miles; due to the amount of ammonia and denaturant stored on-site.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 97,200 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud, or a release of 924,000 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nFor ammonia, the wor"
