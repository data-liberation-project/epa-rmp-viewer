These regulations and guidance are contained in the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  The RMP rule requires facilities that use extremely hazardous substances to develop a Risk Management Plan which identifies the potential effects of a chemical accident, identifies steps the facility is taking to prevent an accident, and spells out emergency response procedures should an accident occur. \n\nEPA\u0092s RMP requirements apply to the following covered chemicals at the Milwaukee Brewery:\n\u0095\tAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a highly hazardous chemical used as a refrigerant in the brewery refrigeration system.  It is a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor.  Direct skin contact may lead to frostbite and tissue damage. The Milwaukee Brewery currently maintains roughly 75,000 \u0096 115,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia in the closed loop refrigeration system that consists of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, and piping.  \n\nRMPs are required to be electronically submitted to the RMP Reporting Center at least once every 5 years or more often if triggered by certain events identified in 40 CFR 68.190 (i.e., updates) or 40 CFR 68.195 (i.e., required corrections).\nAdministrative updates were completed in 2020 and 2021, but the last full resubmission to EPA was completed in August 2018. As an owner/operator of an RMP facility which last completed a full resubmission on August 29, 2018, the Molson Coors USA, LLC \u0096 Milwaukee Brewery (\u0093Milwaukee Brewery\u0094) must fully update and resubmit the RMP no later than August 28, 2023. \n\nThe Milwaukee Brewery is also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
