Chevron Corporate Policy on Protecting People and the Environment\n\nChevron has built a culture of safety and environmental stewardship that strives to achieve world-class performance and prevent all incidents. Our workforce believes that incidents are preventable, and we have policies, processes, tools and behavioral expectations in place to assist us in achieving that goal. \n\nChevron\u0092s vision is to be the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance.\n\nChevron\u0092s safety culture is based on our Tenets of Operation, a code of conduct that employees and contractors use, and that supervisors and managers reinforce. These Tenets are based on two key principles:\n\nDo it safely or not at all; and\nThere\u0092s always time to do it right.\n\nAnother key aspect of Chevron\u0092s safety culture is \u0093stop-work authority.\u0094 Every member of Chevron\u0092s workforce \u0096 whether employee or contractor-has the authority and responsibility to stop work any time they see a condition that may present a risk to people, process safety, or to the environment. Additionally, the employees are empowered to recommend to the operator in charge to shut down a plant using Stop Work Authority due to a Process Safety Hazard.\n\nB. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Refinery is in the City of Richmond, Contra Costa County, State of California. The Refinery is the largest refinery in the Bay Area with an average throughput capacity of approximately 245,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The Refinery covers approximately 2,900 acres. There are approximately 1,300 employees at the Refinery with additional support fulfilled by contractors as needed for special events such as turnarounds or projects.    \n\nThe Refinery  is located on a peninsula bordered by the San Francisco Bay to the north and west, the San Pablo Bay to the northeast, an acid regeneration facility to the southeast and the City of Richmond to the northwest, east and south.

The area immediately surrounding the refinery is nearly all industrial with the neighborhoods of Point Richmond to the south, Atchison Village to the southeast, North Richmond to the northeast, and the Iron Triangle to the east being the most proximal to the facility.\n\nThe Refinery\u0092s primary business is to make transportation fuels from crude oil. The transportation fuel products produced at the Refinery include gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. The Refinery also produces lubricating oils and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Several byproducts are produced by the Refinery\u0092s production processes, including sulfur and anhydrous ammonia, which are recovered from sulfur and nitrogen contained in the crude oil. The EPA and CalARP regulated substances present at the refinery include flammable hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3).\n\nC. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1. Management System   \nThe Refinery\u0092s senior managers have the overall responsibility for adherence to all government regulations, including CalARP, EPA RMP, Cal/OSHA PSM and RISO. The Refinery\u0092s management system provides a framework to ensure Refinery personnel can integrate all the regulatory requirements into Refinery work processes.\n\nLeadership \nThe single largest factor for success at the Richmond Refinery is leadership. The Refinery\u0092s leaders are focused not only on getting results, but getting results the right way with behaviors in accordance with Chevron\u0092s values. They are accountable for stewarding the Refinery\u0092s RMP processes, and for both enabling and delivering performance. \n\nBy their actions, the Refinery\u0092s leaders: \n- Cascade, manage and drive execution; \n- Reinforce the pro"

They are invited to participate in the design, development, implementation and continual improvement of Accidental Release Prevention elements.\n\nl. Hot Work Permits \nControlling ignition sources is vital to the Refinery\u0092s Risk Management Plan. The hot work element prevents inadvertent ignition of flammables or combustibles when performing jobs such as welding and ensures that any fires which may occur can be readily suppressed and extinguished. Management personnel must authorize any hot work (e.g., cutting, grinding, burning, welding, brazing) to be performed in a unit and ensure appropriate safety precautions are taken prior to initiation of the work. The Refinery\u0092s hot work permit program requires that employees complete permit requirements certifying that the applicable portions of the fire prevention and protection requirements are implemented prior to beginning hot work operations.\n\nThe fire prevention procedure restricts hot work in certain areas. When grinding, burning, welding, or brazing work is needed in these areas, an ignition source permit must be initiated by the Maintenance supervisor and approved by the local Operations supervisor. The permit is terminated when continued use of the ignition source is hazardous, when conditions of its issuance change, or when the permitted hot work has been inactive for more than two hours (unless tests show that conditions are still non-hazardous).\n\nThe permit contains the"

The criteria for needing a fire watch are identified in Refinery procedures. The responsibilities and authority of the fire watch are to continuously monitor assigned job(s), extinguish incipient stage fires, sound fire alarm when necessary, and to use Stop Work Authority if they think that work being performed is unsafe.\n\nTrained personnel from Emergency Services, Operations, and Maintenance perform an inspection of the area to ensure the following prior to authorization of hot work:\n- The source of ignition is safe to use.

The questionnaire includes confirmation that the company has an established written safety program, job qualification employee requirements, a program for random drug and alcohol testing, initial and refresher training programs, a behavioral based safety process and a short service employee program.
