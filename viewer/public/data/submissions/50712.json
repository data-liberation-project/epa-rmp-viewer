      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nMonticello Steam Electric Station, Mt. Pleasant, TX 75455\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.\n\nLuminant Power?s overall approach to accident prevention and risk management is as follows:\n\nLuminant Power (LP) is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental \n\nreleases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  LP has implemented safety, environmental protection, \n\nand risk management programs to minimize the risks presented by hazardous materials used at its facilities.  \n\nIf there is an accidental release, LP will either provide, or request from others, immediate emergency response \n\nto minimize the effect of the release.  LP will also immediately notify the public, through local emergency \n\nmanagement agencies, of any actions necessary to ensure public protection.\n\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\nMonticello Steam Electric Station (MOSES) is an electric generating plant using fossil fuel (coal) as an energy \n\nsource.  The coal is burned in large boilers to produce steam, which is used as the motive force for the LP \n\nturbine generators.  LP takes great care in reducing emissions from burning coal to the greatest extent \n\npossible by injecting an ammonia/air mixture into the pollution control devices (electrostatic precipitators and \n\nbaghouses).  The ammonia reacts with sulfur dioxide present in the emission (flue gas) stream and acts to \n\nagglomerate the ash creating a larger particle size and improving performance of the pollution control devices.  \n\n\nLP uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7) at MOSES.  It is purchased as a compressed liquefied \n\ngas in bulk from commercial suppliers and fed to vaporizers where the liquid is converted to a gas and then \n\ninjected into the flue gas streams.  There are two separate ammonia systems at MOSES, each with an 18,000 \n\ngallon storage tank.  Inventory is controlled to a maximum"

      "SummaryText": " of 84,067 pounds of ammonia in each tank.  This \n\ninventory exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds established under the RMP regulations. \n\n\nThe five-year accident history.\n\n\nWithin the past five years, LP?s Monticello Steam Electric Station has not had any accidental releases that \n\nresulted in injuries or property damage.  Under the RMP regulations, all accidental releases of a regulated \n\nsubstance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, \n\ninjuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage\" within the past 5 years \n\nmust be reported.  MOSES has an emergency response program that includes an emergency response plan \n\naddressing the EPA RMP-regulated ammonia system operated at the facility.  \n\nMOSES' emergency response plan contains:\n\n> Procedures for informing the local Emergency Response Agencies and the community about accidental \n   releases.\n\n> Proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental exposures to ammonia gas.\n\n> Specific procedures for emergency response to either stop the ammonia release and/or evacuate people who \n   could be affected by the release.\n\n \nMOSES' Emergency Response Program includes the necessary emergency response equipment, personnel, \n\nand training to respond to potential releases.  MOSES has procedures for emergency equipment use, \n\ninspection, testing, and maintenance.  In addition, MOSES' emergency response plan has been coordinated \n\nwith the Mt. Pleasant Fire Department.\n \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\n\nLP plans to continue the current Preventative Maintenance (PM) Program in an ongoing effort to improve \n\nsafety and reduce the risk of accidental releases at MOSES.  The PM Program has proven effective in reducing \n\npotential risks identified during the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and demonstrates LP?s desire to maintain \n\nthe established Risk Management Program and provide inherently sa"
