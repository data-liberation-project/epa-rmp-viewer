DODGE, IOWA\n\n\n\nKoch Nitrogen Company (KNC) operates a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility at Ft. Dodge, Iowa.  As a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility producing anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products utilizing ammonia as a feedstock, this facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe RMP Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan requirements include submission of the Risk Management Plan, which includes hazard assessments defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, a description of the accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for KNC Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant at Ft. Dodge, Iowa.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Fort Dodge Nitrogen Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility consisting of a large scale, natural gas feed ammonia production unit and an intergrated urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) production unit.  These products are primarily used as agricultural fertilizers.\n\nInitial operation of the ammonia plant began in 1967.  In 1997, the UAN unit was completed and the ammonia plant was revamped and upgraded.\n\nThe facility produces, handles, and stores large quantities of ammonia in its operations.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air and water for the production of ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with byproduct carbon dioxide to produce liquid urea in the UAN plant.  Ammonia and air in the same plant are used to produce nitric acid, which is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate."

Periodically the plan is practiced in a tabletop, classroom type setting, and it also is drilled in mock emergencies including participation by outside responding agencies.\n\n5-Year Accident history\n\nThe RMP rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe Fort Dodge Nitrogen Plant had two qualifying injuries in the past five years.  One occurred on December 2nd, 1999.  A mechanic was working on an ammonia pump in the UAN unit, when ammonia contained in the pump leaked out.  He was given first aid and treated and released at a local hospital.  He returned to work later that day.  The pump had been inadequately cleared and although plant personnel followed the facilities lock out plan there were errors made.  Since the incident, pump clearing procedures were changed to make the possibility of ammonia escaping during pump maintenance less likely.  Training on the new procedures was conducted immediately after the incident.\n\nThe Fort Dodge Nitrogen Plant had another qualifying injury in the past five years, which occurred on October 17, 1998.  On that date, a relief valve lifted in the ammonia loading and unloading area of the plant, which caused a release of ammonia in the loading area relief header system.  An experienced shift production foreman was in the area to correct the problem and a drop of liquid ammonia bypassed the safety glasses, which he was wearing and ended up in his eye.  Since that incident, every employee at the facility has received additional training on the importance of appropriate eye safety equipment and its proper use.  \n\nSynopsis of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP Rule requires a hazard analysis for hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf and alternative release scenarios"

For this facility the regulated substances include anhydrous ammonia and chlorine as regulated toxics, and flammables as a class, which includes methane and hydrogen.  The Rule requires an analysis of the hypothetical \u00bfworst case\u00bf toxic release scenario as that scenario affecting the greatest distance and a hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf flammable accident as a vapor cloud explosion.  Alternative release scenarios, which are more reasonably likely events, for each regulated toxic and flammables, in general, must also be presented.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release \u00bfAmmonia\n\nConsidering the seasonal nature of fertilizer use and application in agriculture, large quantities of the ammonia produced at this facility must be stored until needed by the ultimate consumer.  The RMP Rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the hypothetical \u00bfworst case\u00bf event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nFor this facility, the largest single quantity of ammonia is held in atmospheric storage tanks, each of which contain 30,000-tons.  The hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire amount is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of a tank.  This unlikely event was modeled by a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release events.  Details of the results of this modeling are provided elsewhere in the RMP Submittal.\n\nTo assure that the event indicated above was, in fact, the hypothetical \u00bfworst case\u00bf as the rule defines it; failure of ammonia storage tanks present at the site where ammonia is stored at higher pressure, but much lower quantitie"

Neither of these resulted in a distance greater than the circumstance noted above.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst case is low.  Analysis of this scenario was completed as required by the rule.  Facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, and substantially reduce the probability of such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nWorst-Case Flammable Substances\n\nAs the rule requires, the largest quantity flammable release and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion must be analyzed as the hypothetical \u00bfworst case\u00bf for these substances.  In this facility, a failure releasing the entire contents of the ammonia synthesis loop constitutes the largest flammable release.  This quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look Up Tables.  Although large volumes of flammable gases are handled daily by the plant, actual in-process inventory is relatively small, especially considering the quantity of inert gasses and steam mixed with the flammable gases.  Impact distance is relatively limited as a result.\n\nAlternative Release - Toxics\n\nAmmonia\n\nMore reasonably likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Substantially lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards are present as they are throughout the plant, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.  Such events can include failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, modeled with the DEGADIS model for this facility consisted of an ammonia truck driver leaving the loading station with the loading equipment still attached to his trailer.

Modeled impact distance is substantially lower for more reasonable, but not necessarily likely, release events.\n\nChlorine\n\nChlorine is used at several locations in this plant as a biocidal agent for cooling water systems, much as it is also used in swimming pools.  It is used as a gas from one-ton chlorine cylinders through an injection system to the circulating cooling water.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed is failure of the connecting tubing from the cylinder and release of gaseous chlorine.  This release was modeled using the DEGADIS dispersion program.\n\nFlammables\n\nVolumes of flammable gases are handled throughout the plant, even though actual physical inventory is relatively low, especially considering the quantity of inert gases and steam mixed with the flammable gases.  More likely flammable release events include failures of smaller pipes and lines in comparison to the large release contemplated in the hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf analysis.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed a vapor cloud explosion as a result of a pressure relief valve in the ammonia synthesis loop lifting for 45 seconds.  The impact distance of this event utilized the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look Up Tables.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/PSM Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
