      "SummaryText": "The District maintains an accidental release prevention and emergency response program for chlorine gas, which is utilized during the water treatment process.  Chlorine gas is stored and utilized inside a sealed and contained room.  This room has an alarm system with backup power capable of detection of chlorine leaks.  The water treatment plant is operated on a 24-hour 7-day basis, therefore and accidental release can be responded to immediately.\n\n     If a chlorine leak does take place, there is sufficient saftey equipment, such as air packs, a ventilation system and eye wash/showers, readily available to properly handle an emergency.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are visible throughout the area where chlorine gas is stored.\n\n     Handling of chlorine gas containers is performed by the use of an electric hoist system.  Chlorinefeeders are stored in a separate room from the chlorine gas containers.  This room also has an alarm system, ventilation system and (SCBA).\n\n     Should a chlorine leak occur, the water treatment plant is located on a rural area, which the closest residence is approximately 500 feet away.  Any release can be contained in the enclosed area where it is stored.  Repair kits and SCBA are on hand to assost in the containment and futher release of chlorine gas.\n\n     The District has had no re[ortable accidental release of chlorine gas during the past 5 years.\n\n     The District has an emergency repsonse program which is closly coordinated with the Emergency Response Agency (TEMA) and the local Volunteer Fire Departments, who are also trained in the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and handling of toxic chemicals.\n\n     As funds become available, the District has alternate plans to install air scrubber system or utilize sodium hypochloride in lieu of chlorine gas in the future."
