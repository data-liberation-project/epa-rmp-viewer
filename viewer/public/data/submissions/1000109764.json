In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent and limit possible releases of butane, if a release does occur, a Smart Plan/Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the Pike Township Fire Department and Marion County Health Department (LEPC).\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Indianapolis LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The terminal maintains records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at this facility inclusive of root-cause analyses and associated follow-up actions, as appropriate.  As this is a new process, there have been no accidents within the previous five (5) years resulting in consequences as defined within the EPA RMP reporting requirements.

Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety systems incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Indianapolis LP Terminal.\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in two (2) 60,000 gal. pressure vessels.  The butane is then pumped to a blending/injection skid for direct injection into blend grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid, analyzer and PLC.  Process safety controls include internal/excess flow valves, fusible elements (<250 degrees Fahrenheit), emergency shut-off valves (fail safe), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, manual emergency shutoff devices (ESDs) throughout and on the video display terminal, line hydrostatic pressure reliefs, and component grounding.   Access to the Indianapolis LP Terminal is restricted to employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nMarathon's accidental release prevention and emergency planning/response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by the Terminal's regulated substances to its employees, the public, and the environment.
