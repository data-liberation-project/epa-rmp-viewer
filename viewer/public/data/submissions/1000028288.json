The odor threshod for TDI is 0.17 parts per million (ppm).  Acute exposure to high levels of TDI in humans, via inhalation, results in severe irritation of the skin and eyes and affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems (CNS).  The toxic endpoint for acute exposures established by EPA for Risk Management Programs is 7 mg/m3 (1 ppmv). \nTDI, which presently is delivered to the plant via tank trucks or railcar tanker.  The railcar and the tank truck share the unloading platform which is used to fill up to six 5,000-gallon storage tanks located inside of the plant, within a specially designed containment room.  The threshold quantity for the Risk Management Plan for TDI is 10,000 lb. With a density of 10.2 lb per gallon the maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at the plant is 306,000 lbs, which corresponds to about 245,000 lb of TDI. \nWhen the truck/railcar arrives it is inspected for any visible signs of damage or leaks.  Appropriate precautions and procedures are implemented if a truck/railcar is found to be deficient.  The railcar/truck is connected to the offloading system with the entire contents transferred into six indoor storage tanks; the railcar/truck and each tank are slightly pressurized with a dry air blanket to prevent moisture buildup in the system.  Due to the continuous operation of foam production, when TDI is required to be transferred to wet system day tank the pump in the storage tank room is activated.  The transfer operation ceases when the day tank sensor indicates that it is full or if filling has not been completed in a specified time (which could indicate a fill problem or leak).\nThe 60-gallon day tanks for each line are located on mezzanines.

The conditioning pump ensures a constant pressure and flow of TDI to the filter and heat exchanger to the metering pump.  A return line on the exit side of the conditioning pump to the day tank through a constant pressure valve prevents deadheading.  The filter and heat exchanger ensure the purity and appropriate temperature of TDI for foam production.\nA high pressure flow of TDI is received from the wet system to a flexible hose.  The pour head mixes the component raw materials (TDI and polyol / catalyst mixture) to a uniform mixture and transfers the mixture to the molds.  TDI pour head calibration is conducted on a preset schedule and interim adjustments are made as necessary.  To perform the calibration an operator sets the pour head to calibration mode, which injects one chemical at a time.  TDI is poured into a bucket and weighed to determine that the correct quantity of TDI is injected and the TDI is then either returned to the day tank or appropriately disposed. During molding operations once the TDI/polyol mixture is injected into the mold the mold is closed and an exothermic chemical reaction takes place that transforms the mixture to a polyurethane foam product.  Once this reaction takes place TDI is no longer present in quantities exceeding 1% marking the terminal node of the RMP regulated process.\nThe TDI process has numerous safeguards in place that help prevent the release of TDI and prevent on and off-site exposure if a release were to occur.

This means that that there has been no incident resulting in the sudden release of TDI that has caused on-site or off-site injury, significant on-site damage or any off-site emergency response or injury.   In conjunction with the current ARP and PSM programs in place at the Johnson Controls facility, there is a standard management practice that requires immediate internal reporting of unusual events, including those in which any abnormal emission of regulated chemicals is observed or suspected.  The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity on any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified.\n \n \n6.0   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIt is the policy of the Johnson Controls to place the highest priority on employee safety and health and on protection of the community from all plant-induced environmental conditions. Experience has shown that proper planning and an organized approach will reduce the effects of emergency events.  Prompt internal and external communications, emergency equipment, and trained personnel are the key ingredients of this plan.  Johnson Control's policy provides for external communications with local and county-wide response agencies.  The Highland County HAZMAT Team has the lead responsibility in responding to major releases of TDI that would have the potential to affect off-site locations.\n\n \n7.0   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nJohnson Contr"
