If any emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Williston Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled: this facility stores bulk propane and anhydrous ammonia. There are two (2) 30,000 gallon storage tanks (in a fenced secure area) with all the piping, valves and other equipement needed to load delivery trucks as well as tank wagons for anhydrous ammonia. This is a retail business where the product is delivered to the customer.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios: Our worst-case scenario for propane is the failure of one 30,000 gallon propane tank when filled to the greatest amount (85% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a break in 2\" transfer hose resulting in a 5 minn release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint would extend offsite, and public receptos are within the distance to the endpoint. \n\nThe worst-case scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the failure of one 30,000 gallon anhydrous tank when filled to the greatest ammount (85% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud being released into the air. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenario would be a ruptured hose while transferring product, which would result in a spill.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and "
