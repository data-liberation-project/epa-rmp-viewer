              "Description": "Our specialty process consists of only one production unit.  All Prevention Program elements apply to all equipment assoicated with the single epoxy production system.  Equipment covered by the prevention program include two epichlorohydrin storage tanks and four side by side multi-purpose reactor systems that are designed and operated in identical fashion.  SOP's vary for the various epichlorohydrin based epoxy products and are addresseed by one process hazard analysis.  Document management systems, process safety information, process hazard analysis and the balance of the required RMP training and procedual elements apply to the prevention program as one process unit.  The process hazard analysis for the process was conducted in July, 1995, prior to the construction and start-up of the plant in December 1995.  Risk reduction measures identified in the HAZOP were incorporated into the initial process design and were in place before start-up.  Many of the Prevention Program 3 elements have been gradually implemented over time since 1995.",

      "SummaryText": "II. General Information and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCVC Specialty Chemicals, Inc. (CVC) purchased the Maple Shade, New Jersey facility from Akzo-Nobel Chemicals, Inc. in June 1995.  Full occupancy of the site took place in November 1995 after completion of construction activities to upgrade and convert the site for research and development and small scale manufacturing of specialty epoxy monomers and resins based on epichlorohydrin chemistry.\n\nThe Maple Shade, New Jersey site is the Corporate Headquarters for CVC and serves as the principle site for scale-up, semi-works and small scale manufacturing of epoxy resins and monomers.  CVC handles only one of the listed EPA RMP or NJDEP TCPA listed chemicals above threshold quantities - epichlorohydrin.  Epichlorohydrin is the basic building blocks chemical used in epoxy manufacturing and provides the basis for the site risks management and accident prevention plans.\n\nEpichlorohydrin is handled on site in bulk in quantities that do not exceed 220,000 lb.  Storage facilities include one 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tank for fresh epichlorohydrin storage and one 6,000-gallon storage tank for recycle epichlorohydrin storage.  Process equipment includes four reactors that are 1,200-gallons, 2,000-gallons and two 4,100 gallon reactors in capacity.\n\nThe epoxy resins and monomers (modifiers) produced by CVC are used primarily in the specialty coatings industry.  Applications include civil engineering coatings such as floor coatings, tank and secondary containment linings, and structural steel primers.  Other common uses include adhesives, and specialty automotive and aviation coatings and composites.\nII. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario would occur from the 10,000-gallon above ground epichlorohydrin storage tank located in the west tank farm.  The release would be caused by a catastrophic rupture of the storage tank and resultant leak of up to 10,000-gallons of epichlorohydr"

      "SummaryText": "in to the full surface area of the tank farm.  Emissions would result from continuous evaporation of epichlorohydrin from the tank farm to atmosphere under ambient conditions.\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario was modeled using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) computer model, RMP Comp.  EPA default values of 1.5 meters per second, stability class F and 25?C were used for windspeed, atmospheric stability, and temperature, respectively.  The release rate to the outside air was determined to be 21 pounds per minute and the spill was determined to completely evaporate within 4670 minutes of the release.  Air concentrations of epichlorohydrin were determined to reach the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.076 milligrams per liter at a distance of 0.7 miles from the facility.  A survey of the area surrounding the facility determined that the topography was basically urban.  Public receptors within the toxic endpoint include schools, residences, recreational areas, commercial, office or industrial areas and churches. The residential population within the toxic endpoint was estimated to be 14,100.  The only environmental receptor was determined to be the Pensauken Creek\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - The alternative release scenario involves an epichlorohydrin leak from a pressurized transfer line from the storage tanks to the reactor processing area.  The transfer line is assumed to be under normal discharge pump pressure and the leaks occurring at a flange connection.  The leak would be stopped within five minutes by operating personnel resulting in an epichlorohydrin spill of 1225 pounds inside the main processing building.  Based on the release volume it was determined that the surface area of a one-centimeter thick pool would be smaller than the floor area of the Building, thus the Building would not restrict the size of the pool.\n\n\nThe Alternative Case Release Scenario was also modeled using EPA's computer model, RMP Comp.  EPA default values of 3 meters"

Air concentrations of epichlorohydrin were determined to reach the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.076 milligrams per liter at a distance of 0.1 miles from the facility.  A survey of the area surrounding the facility determined that the topography was basically urban.  Public receptors within the toxic endpoint include industrial facilities. There is no residential population within the toxic endpoint. The only environmental receptor was determined to be the Pensauken Creek.\n\nIII. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Maple Shade facility is designed and operated to minimize the potential for on-site or off-site safety and environmental impact to employees and the surrounding community.  In 1995, the facility was upgraded with the help of a major engineering/construction firm to provide state of the art engineering controls for manufacturing specialty epoxies.\n\nThe company management has demonstrated its commitment to safety and environmental compliance by involving the expertise of employees and consulting engineers in the principals of Process Safety Management.  Since the June start-up in 1996, the company has not had an accidental release involving any hazardous chemical.  There have been no incidents to date of an on-site or off-site injury or illness due to epichlorohydrin handling or exposure.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention is managed by CVC using methodology encouraged by OSHA PSM and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophic Prevention Act (TCPA).  The CVC Maple Shade Facility is operated as an RMP Program 3 facility.  Engineering and operational protocols include:\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process, equipment and chemical safety reviews were condu"
