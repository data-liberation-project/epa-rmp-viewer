We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank interconnected with one 12,000-gallon tank, five 1,500-\n\ngallon nurse tanks, six 1,250-gallon nurse tanks, and thirty-eight 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our\n\nfacility in Berne, Indiana (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 70,550 gallons (363,050.3\n\npounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our\n\nfacility (the 18,000-gallon tank interconnected with the 12,000-gallon tank) contains 131,223 pounds\n\nat 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.
