      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n   1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\nWe at the R. Dwayne Huffman Reclaimed Water Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. The commitment is inherent to a compressive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas of design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforseseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Port Orange Fire and Rescue, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n   2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance to be handled.\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the treatment of domestic wastewater (sewage) from the community of Port Orange Fl.. The wastewater is biologically treated to meet strict criteria as mandated by our operating permit issued by the Florida DEP and then disenfected with chlorine before being recycled to the local residents of the city to be reused as lawn irrigation.Effluent wastewater may be discharged into the Halifax River, if public reuse demand is low. During these periods of river outfall discharge, Sulfur dioxide is used as a de-chlorinating agent. DEP permit states that we will not discharge water ino the river with any detectable chlorine residual in the discharge water. Therefore we store 2 regulated substances at our facility. (Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide).\n   3. The Worst  Case Release Scenario and The Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administration Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit The Distance for each reported scenario.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the RMP Comp software provided by EPA. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.The worst "

The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At class F atmosphere stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.9 miles obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\nOne alternative scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance at or above the threshold quantity in Program 2 and 3 prosess cumulatively.\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine/sulfur dioxide involves a release from tank # 1 in the chlorine/sulfur dioxide process. The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of chlorine a gaseous form over 10 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l of chlorine/sulfur dioxide is 0.9 miles.\n   4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and The Chemical Specific Prevention Steps.\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 edition. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release program that is in place at our stationary source.\n   Process Safety Information- R. Dwayne Huffman Reclaimed Water Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n   Process Hazard Analysis- Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analysis is the What If  Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process operations, and are revalidated at a regular annual"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n   Operating Procedures- For the purpose of safety conducting activities within our covered procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and start-up after turnaround. The information is regulary reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\nTraining- R. Dwayne Huffman Reclaimed Water Plant has a comprehensive training program to ensure all employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years, and more frequently as needed.\n   Mechanical Integrity- R. Dwayne Huffman Reclaimed Water Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems,emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices, furthermore these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n   Management of Change- Written procedures are in place at The R. Dwayne Huffman Reclaimed Water Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of an offered training to deal with the modification.\n   Pre-startup Reviews- Pre-startup reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at The R.
