              "Description": "The Bryan Condensate Stabilizer Station ?Bryan Condensate? facility is located in a rural area of southern Marshall County, near Proctor, West Virginia. Unprocessed condensate and associated flash gas enter the facility through field gathering pipelines and flow into vessels where water and flash gas are separated. The flash gas is sent to the compression suction header and the condensate is sent to slug catchers to separate additional water. Unstable condensate flows out of the slug catchers through a filter to remove particulates and into the stabilizers. The rate at which condensate flows into the stabilizers is controlled by flow control valves on the inlet of the stabilizer skids. \n\nOverhead gas from the top of the tower is routed to the compression suction header. Stable condensate from the tower bottom is routed into condensate storage tanks and waits for truck loading via a closed loop loading process. Any vapors from the storage tanks are routed to a low-pressure side of a dual headed flare. Gas from the slug catchers and stabilizers are routed to the compression suction header. The gas flows to a compression suction scrubber to knock out any fluid prior to compression. Any fluid that is knocked out goes to an NGL storage tank. Flash gas from this process is routed to the high-pressure side of the flare. NGLs from the storage tank are loaded onto a pressurized truck via a closed loop loading process. Gas that is compressed is sent to sales pipelines. The facility has been designed in a manner that will minimize the potential for accidental releases from regulated substances.\n\n",

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is XCL Midstream's policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations. The Bryan Condensate Facility has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is XCL Midstream's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Also, XCL Midstream has coordinated response activities with the Marshall County EMA and local Fire and Rescue Departments.\n\n\n\nB. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Bryan Condensate Facility is a condensate stabilizer facility located in rural Marshall County, West Virginia, near Proctor, West Virginia. The products handled are flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nC. The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\na. Worst Case Scenario:\n\nSince the Bryan Condensate Facility does not have any toxic regulated substances above the threshold quantity, the worst-case scenario was only carried out for the uncontrolled release of the largest inventory of flammable mixtures, which was more than 10,000 pounds of a mixture of flammable substances that meet criteria for the NFPA-4 rating. To carry out this analysis, it was assumed that none of the protective barriers in the facility worked. EPA assumes the worst-case scenario to be a vapor cloud explo"

For the Bryan Condensate Facility, it was assumed that the single pressure vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (NGL Storage Tank V-410) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. RMP*Comp, an EPA-sponsored software tool, was used to calculate the distances to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint. As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on a release of propane, a component of the mixture in the tank. Meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mi/h). The scenario involved a catastrophic release of the total quantity of the flammable substance assumed to form a vapor cloud, which detonates. Ten percent (10%) of the material in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion, 13,252 lbs.\n\n\n\nb. Alternative Case scenarios:\n\nAn alternative case scenario considered a release from the NGL Storage Tank V-410 resulting in a vapor cloud fire. Ethane was selected as the predominant regulated component of the mixture, as it resulted in a greater distance to the lower flammable limit (LFL) endpoint. RMP*Comp, was used to predict a distance of 0.1 miles to the LFL endpoint, with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77?F). The scenario involved a release of 4,290 lbs/min which continues until the NGL Storage Tank is empty.\n\n\n\nD. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA. The Bryan Condensate Facility is a PSM- covered facility and, as such, it has a viable process safety program. Workers and the"
