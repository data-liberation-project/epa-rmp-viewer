              "Description": "The Johnsonville site takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management system addresses key features of successful prevention programs including; Process Technology, Process Hazards Analysis, Operating Procedures and Safe Work Practices, Training and Performance, Mechanical Integrity, Quality Assurance, Management  of Change Personnel, Pre-start up, Auditing, Incident Investigation, Management of Change, and Operational Discipline in compliance with Federal RMP regulations for a Process Level 3 at 40 CFR 68.65 through 68.87, and its OSHA parallel program at 29 CFR 1910.119(a) through (p).  The site also adheres to Chemours' internal process safety standard (PSM-S21) that goes beyond these regulatory requirements.  The site also voluntarily complies with the requirements the American Chemistry Councils RC-14001 standard; process safety management is one of the seven competencies of Responsible Care Management (RCMS). The site is required by Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act to implement a Risk Management Program consisting the actions established by 68.12(d)(3), namely:  1) a management system to implement the Risk Management Program on site, 2) the Process Level 3 prevention requirements described above, and 3) a site-level Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nThe individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to full compliance with these management systems, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\n\n\nManagement System\n\nThe site Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the continued implementation of the elements of our Risk Management Program.  Our Plant Manager designates a site Environmental Health and Safety manager to whom the site PSM/RMP Coordinator and the site Emergency Response Coordinator Report.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator is a member of the plant organization with the necessary background, training and experience to fulfill this position.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator, has the responsibility for the continued implementation and integration of the EPA RMP elements and the elements of OSHA's PSM program.  \n\n\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facility's Process Safety Management Leadership Team (PSMLT). One of the members of the PSMLT is the Emergency Response Coordinator. This PSM Committee is comprised of members with responsibilities that include maintaining and upgrading specific elements of our Risk Management and Process Safety Management Programs for the entire site.  Managing the specific elements of our Risk Management and Process Safety programs is a \"line organization\" function; this means that the people who manage the operation of the site are personally accountable for implementing the site's Risk Management and Process Safety programs.  \n\n\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for ensuring that the facility has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets EPA/RMP and OSHA PSM requirements.  Although the PSM/RMP Coordinator has specific individual responsibilities, many of the responsibilities for specific program elements are assigned to other members of PSM Leadership Team and the site's line management organization.\n\n",

The facilities are situated on a 1500-acre site; however, only about 200 acres are developed. The remainder of the property is set aside as a wildlife habitat and location of the employee recreation area. We manufacture titanium dioxide (TiO2), under the trade name TiPure as our primary product.  Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride-ilmenite process in which titanium dioxide ore is chlorinated to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4); the TiCl4 is subsequently re-oxidized to refined TiO2. \n\n\n\nRMP-COVERED CHEMICALS are Chlorine and Titanium Tetrachloride.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no RMP-reportable accidents at the site. Our on site medical department or first aid responders treated the injured and all returned to work. We conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root cause for all safety incidents.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nJohnsonville's emergency response program is contained in our Emergency Manual and managed by the site's Emergency Response Coordinator. It consolidates the various regulations for emergency response planning.   "
