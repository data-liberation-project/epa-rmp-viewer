Corporate Prevention  and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Publix Super Market, Inc. (Publix) Deerfield Beach Facility is located at 777 S.W. 12th Avenue, Deerfield Beach, Broward County, Florida.  Publix requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Publix ?s corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Publix Deerfield Beach Facility is located west of Interstate I-95 and south of Highway 810 on the northwest side of the city of Deerfield Beach, Broward County, Florida.  The facility consists of a dairy manufacturing area and areas for wet and dry produce, frozen, and cooler storage of frozen foods and meats for distribution to the Publix Super Markets.\n\nThe Deerfield Beach Facility has an ammonia refrigeration system in which exceed the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system?s equipment is located in the facility?s two machine or compressor rooms.  The system has two high pressure receivers (HPR) located inside these rooms.  For the purposes of this analysis the largest capacity HPR vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system was chosen.  This HPR is capable of holding approximately 35,705 lbs. of ammonia.  \n \n3. Prevention Program\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Deerfield Beach Facility refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The Deerfield Beach Facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevent"

      "SummaryText": "ion Program.  Also, in 2001 Publix appointed an individual dedicately solely to the position of PSM Coordinator for the PSM programs at each of their facilities. \n\nThe Deerfield Beach Facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Deerfield Beach Facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, are used to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Deerfield Beach Facility refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff also has performed PHAs of this process in 1994 and 1999.  A PHA revalidation is planned for July 2004. Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audit"

The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Accident History\n\nThe Deerfield Beach Facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia that have resulted in offsite consequences in the last five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Deerfield Beach Facility has Emergency React Procedures in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has developed a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Deerfield Beach Fire Rescue, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519."
