      "SummaryText": "NUNES COOLING INC.  is located within the city limits of Salinas, California, in a predominately business/industrial area, and is a produce pre-cooling, cold storage, and shipping facility.   The facility was first constructed on this site in the late 1960's and has been in continuous seasonal operation since that time.   Anhydrous ammonia is used as the closed loop system refrigerant for the pre-cooling and cold storage equipment and is the only acutely hazardous chemical used on the site .   The facility consists of approximately 40,000 sq ft of cold storage warehouse space and various types of fixed and mobile pre-cooling equipment on the aproximate 12 acre site.\n       The risks to the community from this facility would come from an incident in which the ammonia normally contained within the refrigeration system was allowed to escape into the atmosphere.   Events which were considered possible and able to cause a release of ammonia for the purposes of the Hazard Evaluation were:  equipment failure, operator error, design deficiency,  vehicular accident, acts of sabotage/vandalism, fire and earthquake.   It is expected that other specific events would have similar results as those listed above.   Direct contact with the released ammonia vapor by people inside the toxic endpoint is the main area of concern.\n       \n          Mitigation of ammonia releases is addressed by the following:\n               1.   System design and construction\n               2.   Administrative controls\n               3.   Containment curb inside the main engine room\n               4.   Diffusion tanks for PRV releases\n               5.   Operating engineer on-site daily\n               6.   Off-hours security service\n               7.   A release inside of a building would require closing the building doors\n       Administrative controls and policies to be used in the event of a release are contained in the existing \n Business Response Plan - 1999.

The essential risk reduction steps now in effect at this facility are:\n               1.   Regular daily equipment inspections\n               2.   The daily recording of equipment operating data\n               3.   Maintaining equipment maintenance records\n               4.   Maintaining records of previous releases and their causes\n               5.   Proper training of operators\n               6.   Mechanical and electrical system controls automatically maintain the correct system\n                        temperatures and pressures, and provide safety shut-down and pressure relief in\n                        the event that the system operates out of the design limits.\n               7.   Ammonia diffusion tanks are installed to contain ammonia that could be released through \n                        a pressure relief valve in the main engine room. \n               8.   Pressure vessels are equiped with high level alarm switches.\n               9.   All equipment and system components are designed for ammonia service\n              10.  The system was designed and installed in accordance with applicable Federal, State\n                        and local codes and ordinances.\n              11.
