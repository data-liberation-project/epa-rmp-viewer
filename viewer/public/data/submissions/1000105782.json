In addition to the safety practices of the facility and facility personnel that make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event. In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a chlorine release:\n\nThere are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place without exposing anyone to the chlorine.\nThe system is monitored by the SCADA system that would assist in preventing a deviation resulting in a release.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by personnel, as necessary.\nThe system has chlorine sensors that automatically notify on the SCADA system and activate various alarms and shutdowns.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Otay Water District - Ralph W.

Chapman Water Recyling Facility has a long-standing commitment to its workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorine injection system. The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Otay Water District - Ralph W. Chapman Water Recyling Facility treats and processes water for consumer use. The facility utilizes a Chlorine Injection System to sanitize the untreated water within the system. The facility has a max intended inventory of 10,000 pounds of chlorine within five (5) 1-ton chlorine cylinders (10,000 pounds).\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nPer the CalARP Regulations one worst case analysis has been defined for the chlorine system.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment in the Compliance Workbook.  This worst-case release scenario is highly unlikely should a worst-case release occur, the sudden rupture and flashing would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used. RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The downwind distance for the alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenarios.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook.\n\nRisk Considerations\nAltho"
