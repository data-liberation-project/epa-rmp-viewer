Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n     \nThe ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery's process operations involve the handling, use, processing, or storage of hazardous materials that may present a certain degree of risk. The Torrance Refinery is committed to conducting business in a manner that addresses the environmental needs of the communities in which we operate, and that protects the safety and health of our employees, those involved in our operations, our customers and the public. These commitments are documented in our safety, health, environmental, and security policies.  These policies are put into practice through a disciplined management framework called Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).\nThe Torrance Refinery's OIMS framework establishes expectations for controlling operations integrity risks inherent in our business.  OIMS addresses all aspects of our business, including security, that can impact safety, health and environmental performance.  OIMS encompasses all elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and of EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nThe OIMS framework includes 11 elements. Each element contains an underlying principle and a set of expectations.  The OIMS framework also includes the characteristics of, and processes\nfor, evaluating and implementing OI Management Systems. Application of the OIMS framework is  required across the facility, with particular emphasis on design, construction and operations.  Management is responsible for ensuring that management systems satisfying the framework are put in place. \n\nThe 11 OIMS elements are:\n1. Management, Leadership, Commitment and Accountability\n2. Risk Assessment and Management\n3. Facilities Design and Construction\n4. Information/Documentation\n5. Personnel and Training\n6. Operations and Maintenance\n7. Management of Change\n8. Third-Party Services\n9. Incident Investigation and Analysis\n10."

Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Torrance Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. jet fuel, diesel fuel, kerosene, gasoline, LPG, and other chemicals) from raw Crude Oil.  These processes contain regulated substances and flammable mixtures which may include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, pentane, and hydrofluoric acid.\n\n3. Five-Year Accident History \n\nThe Torrance Refinery has experienced two releases as defined by 40CFR Part 68 in the past 5 years.  These incidents are described below;\n\n1) 1/2/2003 - An incident involved a release of isobutane while off loading a railcar.  No injuries on site or off site were experienced as a result of this incident, as a precautionary measure Prarie Avenue was closed (evacuated) for a brief period of time. \n\n2) 7/19/2001 - A mechanical failure caused the release of MHF and hydrocarbon vapor from the Alkylation Unit. No injuries on site or off site were experienced as a result of this incident.  As a precautionary measure community zones 4, 7 and 10 were sheltered in place for a brief period of time.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nFollowing is a summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program in place at The ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery.  All requirements of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program are contained within our Operation Integrity Management System (OIMS).\n \n4.1 Employee Participation. OIMS 1.1, Management Leadership, Commitment and Accountability ensures active employee involvement and participation in the Operations Integrity process. Employees are encouraged to participate in the many programs and activities that support achievement of OIMS, EPA RMP and OSHA PSM objectives. Participation is essential for an effective safety program and is encouraged for employees (wage or"

Participation addresses three (3) distinct objectives: communication, engagement and empowerment.\n\n4.2 Process Safety Information. OIMS 4.1, Refinery Documentation, requires maintenance of accurate and current information on the configuration and capabilities of processes, facilities, and regulatory requirements.  System Plan 4.1 provides a description of the system to ensure that equipment information concerning the refinery hardware and processes is kept accurate and up to date.  This information is essential to assess and manage risks; facilitate training; facilitate troubleshooting; and plan changes.\n \n4.3 Hazard Assessment. OIMS 2.1, Risk Assessment and Management, ensures appropriate hazard assessments are conducted.  Risk assessments reduce risks to safety, health and the environment and mitigate consequences of incidents by providing essential information for decision making.

OIMS 5.1, Personnel Safety, identifies an expectation and provides a process for employees to contribute directly in every decision and task toward creating a safer work place. No business objective is so important that it will be pursued at the sacrifice of safety. \n\n4.10 Management of Change. OIMS 7.1, Management of Change, requires management of temporary or permanent modifications and changes.  The 7.1 System Plan provides the process for managing temporary or permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Changes impacting these areas are evaluated and managed to ensure that safety, health and environmental risks arising from these changes remain at an acceptable level.\n\n4.11 Incident Investigation. OIMS 9.1, Incident Investigation and Analysis, requires incident investigation, reporting and follow-up.  The 9.1 System Plan documents the process implemented at Chalmette Refining to notify, investigate, report and perform follow-up for Safety, Health, Environmental and other incidents.  This process ensures the opportunity to learn from incidents and implement corrective action to prevent recurrence of the incidents. \n\n4.12 Compliance Audits. The PSM Assessment Program, under OIMS 11.1, Assessment and Improvement, defines the procedure, roles, and responsibilities used for conducting OSHA PSM Assessments at the Torrance Refinery.  The PSM Assessment is completed a minimum of once every 36 months.  The OSHA PSM Assessment may be conducted in concert with the OIMS External Assessment, or can be conducted by a qualified third party PSM Auditor. The PSM Assessment provides a field focus to complement the system focus of OIMS Assessments.  \n\n5. Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Torrance Refinery hav"
