(Penford) is committed to operating its business in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Penford has established a comprehensive safety, health, and environmental management process to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this process is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Penford and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) regulation 40CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Penford.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the program.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPenford is committed to the safety of its workers and the public, the preservation of the environment, and the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Penford has made significant investments in process equipment, safety systems, and personnel to ensure the safety of its operations, minimize the impact of its operations on the environment, and prevent releases from occurring.  This commitment is clearly stated in Penford?s Environmental, Health, & Safety Policy, and reinforced as a critical element in employee performance appraisals and the profit sharing plan.  A well-qualified Environmental, Health, & Safety (EHS) staff, a highly competent in-house engineering group, and a committed senior management team ensure process safety is given the highest priority.\n\nPenford is also well prepared to respond to and contain a release if one should occur.  Penford maintains trained emergency response coordinators on-site at all times, with"

Active participation on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and regular interface with the fire department and other response agencies ensure a large team of experts is ready to respond should they be needed.  Familiarity with Penford?s processes and chemicals, established response plans, and extensive training ensure local emergency agencies can provide the community appropriate support if needed.\n\nChemical Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nPenford is a corn wet milling industry whose primary business is the manufacture of specialty carbohydrate based products for the paper and textile industries.  Penford is headquartered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and is a full-line, value added supplier ? from research and development to commercial products for the wet end, size press and coater in papermaking applications.  Penford has been in this location for over 100 years and today is considered an innovative leader in carbohydrate technology by the papermaking industry both in the United Stated States and throughout the world.\n\nIn the manufacture of its specialty carbohydrate based products, Penford uses several chemicals listed by the RMP rule as regulated substances which are stored on site above the EPA threshold quantities.  These substances are sulfur dioxide, ethylene oxide, 1,3-butadiene, and chlorine.\n\nSulfur dioxide is stored for use in the Corn Wet Milling Process.  In this process a small quantity of sulfur dioxide in a water medium is added to large tanks containing shelled corn.  The corn kernels are steeped or soaked in this slightly acidic medium for 20-40 hours.  This steeping or soaking helps to soften the corn kernel and make it easier to separate the kernel into a number of useful components.  This separation process is called ?corn wet milling?.  The most important component of the kernel for Penford is the starch.  The starch is the raw material from which all of Penford?s specialty starches are manufactured.  Ot"

In this process a small quantity of ethylene oxide is reacted with starch to structurally modify or alter the basic natural starch polymer.  The resulting hydroxyethylated starch is used in sizing and coating paper and paper products for the purpose of improving the printing and writing surface characteristics, adding strength or tear resistance, increasing base weight, improving overall appearance, imparting better water resistance, and increasing the manufacturing efficiencies of the papermaking process.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility in a bulk railcar.  The railcar is the storage vessel for the chlorine that is used in the Sodium Hypochlorite Process.  In this process chlorine is reacted with sodium hydroxide (caustic) to produce sodium hypochlorite, also referred to as ?hypo? or ?bleach?.  Sodium hypochlorite is reacted with starch to whiten or bleach the starch and/or to structurally modify or alter the chemical properties of the natural starch polymer.  The finished products are used primarily in the papermaking industry.\n\n1,3-butadiene is stored for use in the Starch-Copolymer Process.  In this process 1,3-butadiene and styrene are reacted with starch to produce a combination of synthetic and natural starch based polymers. Starch-copolymer products are unique in that they are out-of-the-container-ready-to-use versions of Penford?s sizing and coating starches that are used in papermaking and textile manufacturing.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Penford Products Co. facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

Employee Participation\n\nIt is Penford?s policy to utilize the most knowledgeable and experienced resources available in the execution of its process safety and accident prevention programs.  To accomplish this, Penford encourages (and at times requires) contractors and employees at all levels of the organization to participate in these programs.  Operating unit personnel participate in hazard studies, incident investigations, periodic audits, and management of change reviews.  Several committees with operator and contractor participation are responsible for the development of related programs and procedures.  Written policies reinforce the importance of employee participation and ensure process-related information is made available to those involved.  All employees (including field personnel) actively participate in Penford?s safety process.\n\n\n2.    Process Safety Information/Trade Secrets\n\nRecognizing the importance of developing and maintaining technical documentation, Penford has established documentation standards and developed a computer-based document control system.  When new or modified processes are developed, they are designed to meet or exceed all accepted trade and design standards.  Chemical suppliers, engineering and trade associations, regulatory agencies, and equipment suppliers are contacted to provide pertinent design information used by the process engineers.  Materials of construction, design specifications, safe operating limits, operating and maintenance procedures, chemical safety information, and other key information are collected or developed to ensure the process operates safely.

Penford ensures that its processes are maintained within their process limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown and safety systems).\n\nPenford is ISO 9001:2000 certified and process-related information is managed using ISO-compliant practices to ensure it is readily available and properly updated. A process information index helps direct personnel to the appropriate documents.  Penford?s access to information policy ensures process safety information is available to all personnel working in or affected by the process.\n\n3.    Process Hazard Analysis\n\nPenford utilizes team-based hazard analysis techniques to ensure all potential hazards are identified and multiple levels of protection are in place to prevent an incident.  Teams with engineers, operators, mechanics and safety professionals spend weeks evaluating each component and procedure of each process.  If new processes are developed, hazard evaluations are conducted at each phase of the design and construction.  Multiple hazard evaluation techniques including hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, fault tree analysis, and failure mode and effects analysis, are utilized.  HAZOP, recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques is used for all process reviews.  \n\nTrained study leaders, computerized hazard analysis software, and written hazard study protocol ensure each study is effective.  Every change to a process is similarly evaluated, and each process is comprehensively re-evaluated at least every five years. Penford has established a system to ensure timely response to findings and recommendations.  The computer-based system ensures recommendations are documented, actions prioritized, and responsibilities assigned; a written schedule for completing action is developed; action is taken and documented; and action is communicated to affect"

Management of Change\n\nTo ensure proposed changes to processes are properly evaluated before they are implemented, Penford has developed an effective management of change program.  All proposed changes are carefully evaluated by engineers, operators, safety professionals, and site management to ensure a change does not introduce an unforeseen hazard.  Changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other process changes are subject to the management of change review.  When changes are implemented, operating and maintenance procedures are updated, employees and mechanics are trained, documentation is updated, and stores/inventory systems are updated.  To ensure this occurs and the installation is completed as designed, a pre-startup safety review is conducted.\n\n5.    Operating Procedures\n\nPenford maintains detailed written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  When process changes are made, the management of change process ensures affected procedures are updated and operators are re-trained.  Process control equipment and software have also been programmed to require compliance with operating procedures.  In addition, Penford?s distributed control systems (DCS) which control the process  equipment have been programmed with safety interlocks that run in parallel and oversee normal operations providing yet another layer of protection.  \n\n6.    Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures, Penford has developed a comprehensive training program for all of its employees and contractors.  New employees are required to comple"

After successfully completing the new hire orientation, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  The new operator must demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner prior to working independently.  In addition, all operators must successfully complete periodic refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  \n\nPrior to working at Penford, contractors are required to certify that their employees have successfully completed required safety training.  Penford then provides additional training to every contractor employee prior to his or her assignment within the plant.  \n\nA computer-based training management package helps keep track of training for employees and contractors and makes sure refresher training is completed as required.  Employees and contractors are issued photo training cards, and are required to present them when performing certain activities in the plant.  Significant investments in training resources, including three fully-equipped training centers, a computer interactive training system, and hands-on training facilities help ensure the training is effective.\n\n7.    Contractors\n\nContractors play a key role in Penford?s operation, and as such, Penford maintains an extensive contractor program.  Prior to working at the facility, potential contractors must pre-qualify, describing their management structure, insurance coverage, training process, historical safety performance, and a wide range of other pertinent information.  If the contractor meets Penford?s stringent requirements, each contractor employee must attend Penford?s contractor safety training.

If successfully completed, the contractor employee is issued a training card valid for one year.  The contractor employee can be qualified for other activities (such as hot work or line breaking) if they successfully complete that training.  A committee, with Penford and contractor representatives, periodically audits each contractor?s safety performance and their overall safety process.  \n\n8.    Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nPenford conducts a Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new process or significant process modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all support systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n9.    Mechanical Integrity\n\nPenford has well-established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment in a safe operating condition.  Written maintenance procedures have been established for key equipment to help ensure that the work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Mechanics and contractors working on the equipment are trained in the procedures, the process itself, potential safety and health issues, emergency response procedures, and the site?s safe work practices.   \n\nA Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) is utilized to ensure all required preventive maintenance and testing is performed at recommended intervals.

The well-managed incident investigation process serves as a valuable input for the periodic hazard analyses.\n\n12.    Compliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure the process safety and accident prevention program is functioning properly, Penford periodically conducts comprehensive audits.  To ensure the audits provide adequate coverage, the OSHA Program Quality Verification (PQV) guidelines are used to establish minimum audit requirements.  Additional areas of focus are included based on an evaluation of previous audit results, previous incidents, changes to the process, and additional OSHA/EPA guidance or clarifications.  To ensure the audits accurately reflect the program effectiveness, employee interviews, written documentation reviews, and process observations are included. The audit team documents its findings, develops recommendations for improving the program, prioritizes recommendations, and assigns responsibilities.  An action item database is maintained to ensure corrective actions are completed on a timely basis and appropriate documentation is maintained.  Corrective action taken in response to the audit team?s recommendations is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at Penford have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at Penford.  Collectively, these prevention programs help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.  \n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Penford has installed safety features on many process units to quickly "
