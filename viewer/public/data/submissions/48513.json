Active participation on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and regular interface with the fire department and other response agencies ensure a large team of experts is ready to respond should they be needed.  Familiarity with Penford\u00bfs processes and chemicals, established response plans, and extensive training ensure local emergency agencies can provide the community appropriate support if needed.\n\nChemical Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nPenford is a corn wet milling industry whose primary business is the manufacture of specialty carbohydrate based products for the paper and textile industries.  Penford is headquartered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and is a full-line, value added supplier \u00bf from research and development to commercial products for the wet end, size press and coater in papermaking applications.  Penford has been in this location for over 100 years and today is considered an innovative leader in carbohydrate technology by the papermaking industry both in the United Stated States and throughout the world.\n\nIn the manufacture of its specialty carbohydrate based products, Penford uses several chemicals listed by the RMP rule as regulated substances which are stored on site above the EPA threshold quantities.  These substances are sulfur dioxide, ethylene oxide, 1,3-butadiene, and chlorine.\n\nSulfur dioxide is stored for use in the Corn Wet Milling Process.  In this process a small quantity of sulfur dioxide in a water medium is added to large tanks containing shelled corn.  The corn kernels are steeped or soaked in this slightly acidic medium for 20-40 hours.  This steeping or soaking helps to soften the corn kernel and make it easier to separate the kernel into a number of useful components.  This separation process is called \u00bfcorn wet milling\u00bf.  The most important component of the kernel for Penford is the starch.  The starch is the raw material from which all of Penford\u00bfs specialty starches are manufactured.  Ot"

In this process a small quantity of ethylene oxide is reacted with starch to structurally modify or alter the basic natural starch polymer.  The resulting hydroxyethylated starch is used in sizing and coating paper and paper products for the purpose of improving the printing and writing surface characteristics, adding strength or tear resistance, increasing base weight, improving overall appearance, imparting better water resistance, and increasing the manufacturing efficiencies of the papermaking process.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility in a bulk railcar.  The railcar is the storage vessel for the chlorine that is used in the Sodium Hypochlorite Process.  In this process chlorine is reacted with sodium hydroxide (caustic) to produce sodium hypochlorite, also referred to as \u00bfhypo\u00bf or \u00bfbleach\u00bf.  Sodium hypochlorite is reacted with starch to whiten or bleach the starch and/or to structurally modify or alter the chemical properties of the natural starch polymer.  The finished products are used primarily in the papermaking industry.\n\n1,3-butadiene is stored for use in the Starch-Copolymer Process.  In this process 1,3-butadiene and styrene are reacted with starch to produce a combination of synthetic and natural starch based polymers. Starch-copolymer products are unique in that they are out-of-the-container-ready-to-use versions of Penford\u00bfs sizing and coating starches that are used in papermaking and textile manufacturing.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Penford Products Co. facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

To accomplish this, Penford encourages (and at times requires) contractors and employees at all levels of the organization to participate in these programs.  Operating unit personnel participate in hazard studies, incident investigations, periodic audits, and management of change reviews.  Several committees with operator and contractor participation are responsible for the development of related programs and procedures.  Written policies reinforce the importance of employee participation and ensure process-related information is made available to those involved.  All employees (including field personnel) actively participate in Penford\u00bfs safety process.\n\n\n2.\tProcess Safety Information/Trade Secrets\n\nRecognizing the importance of developing and maintaining technical documentation, Penford has established documentation standards and developed a computer-based document control system.  When new or modified processes are developed, they are designed to meet or exceed all accepted trade and design standards.  Chemical suppliers, engineering and trade associations, regulatory agencies, and equipment suppliers are contacted to provide pertinent design information used by the process engineers.  Materials of construction, design specifications, safe operating limits, operating and maintenance procedures, chemical safety information, and other key information are collected or developed to ensure the process operates safely.

A process information index helps direct personnel to the appropriate documents.  Penford\u00bfs access to information policy ensures process safety information is available to all personnel working in or affected by the process.\n\n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nPenford utilizes team-based hazard analysis techniques to ensure all potential hazards are identified and multiple levels of protection are in place to prevent an incident.  Teams with engineers, operators, mechanics and safety professionals spend weeks evaluating each component and procedure of each process.  If new processes are developed, hazard evaluations are conducted at each phase of the design and construction.  Multiple hazard evaluation techniques including hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, fault tree analysis, and failure mode and effects analysis, are utilized.  HAZOP, recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques is used for all process reviews.  \n\nTrained study leaders, computerized hazard analysis software, and written hazard study protocol ensure each study is effective.  Every change to a process is similarly evaluated, and each process is comprehensively re-evaluated at least every five years.

All proposed changes are carefully evaluated by engineers, operators, safety professionals, and site management to ensure a change does not introduce an unforeseen hazard.  Changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other process changes are subject to the management of change review.  When changes are implemented, operating and maintenance procedures are updated, employees and mechanics are trained, documentation is updated, and stores/inventory systems are updated.  To ensure this occurs and the installation is completed as designed, a pre-startup safety review is conducted.\n\n5.\tOperating Procedures\n\nPenford maintains detailed written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  When process changes are made, the management of change process ensures affected procedures are updated and operators are re-trained.  Process control equipment and software have also been programmed to require compliance with operating procedures.  In addition, Penford\u00bfs distributed control systems (DCS) which control the process  equipment have been programmed with safety interlocks that run in parallel and oversee normal operations providing yet another layer of protection.  \n\n6.\tTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures, Penford has developed a comprehensive training program for all of its employees and contractors.

In addition, all operators must successfully complete periodic refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  \n\nPrior to working at Penford, contractors are required to certify that their employees have successfully completed required safety training.  Penford then provides additional training to every contractor employee prior to his or her assignment within the plant.  \n\nA computer-based training management package helps keep track of training for employees and contractors and makes sure refresher training is completed as required.  Employees and contractors are issued photo training cards, and are required to present them when performing certain activities in the plant.  Significant investments in training resources, including three fully-equipped training centers, a computer interactive training system, and hands-on training facilities help ensure the training is effective.\n\n7.\tContractors\n\nContractors play a key role in Penford\u00bfs operation, and as such, Penford maintains an extensive contractor program.  Prior to working at the facility, potential contractors must pre-qualify, describing their management structure, insurance coverage, training process, historical safety performance, and a wide range of other pertinent information.
