Primary activities include sales of Anhydrous Ammonia.  We only have this product on hand for 30 to 90 day in the spring, March to May, and 30 to 60 days in the fall, November to December.  We try to have the storage tank near empty when not in season.  We inspect all equipment both spring and fall and replace as needed.  We have never had an anhydrous release and try to implement all safety precautions on the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Our local fire department is trained in Anhydrous releases and know our facility.  We have been in business 32 years handling fertilizer, feed, seed and other farm supplies."
