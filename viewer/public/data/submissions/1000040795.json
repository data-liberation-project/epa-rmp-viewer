The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program.  The company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM). The PSM program is executed through YEX's partner, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  WPS is a stakeholder in the YEX operation and has offices and staff on-site.  PSM is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases.  It is the primary goal of YEX and WPS to protect employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to company operations. \n\n\n\nYEX has adopted a \"non-responding facility\" policy; has established an Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the Yuma Community Emergency Plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established; coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department is performed on an ongoing basis.  One of the ways that emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current is via the annual submittal of appropriate Reports, and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nWPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with eme"

Ammonia emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  Each company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training (production workers contracted by YEX are trained for their emergency actions.  Refrigeration Technicians employed by WPS are trained for their emergency actions).\n\n\n\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Yuma Express facility is located in Yuma, AZ in a commercial/industrial area outside the city.  The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables (produce) and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage prior to shipping distribution throughout the country.  The fresh produce is on-site generally four days from harvesting.  The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods beginning in mid-November and finishing in early April. \n\n\n\nThe refrigerant in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system.  Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  At certain times of the year portable cooling equipment is required to augment the fixed equipment at the facility. Due to the seasonal operation of the Plant, the refrigerant is removed and placed in storage vessels at the end of each season.  The vessels are rated at higher pressure and temperature than the equipment it is transferred out of.  The vessels are provided shade, traffic barriers and a water sprinkler system.  The water sprinkler system reduces pressure and temperature on very hot days in the Yuma area.   \n\n\n\nOperation of the facility is a coordinated effort. Yuma Express Cool"

Yuma Express Cooling, LLC leases the site including stationary refrigeration equipment to Taylor Farms.  Separately, WPS leases portable refrigeration equipment to Taylor Farms.  Maintenance of the entire refrigeration system is the responsibility of WPS which has offices and staff on-site. WPS and Taylor Farms work together to implement the Risk and Process Safety Management Plan which is in the name of Yuma Express Cooling, LLC - Site #1.  Site #2 is at a separate address with a different Lessee, and has its own RMP. \n\n\n\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to prevent accidental releases & promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site's RMP/PSM Plan.\n\n\n\nWPS is the company that maintains the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the site.  WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to dis-assembly and moving portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the work order system. Tasks are tracked through the"

Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, YEX and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\n\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIt is apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves are now used as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility uses these types of valves at all oil drain points.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at Yuma Express, LLC:\n\n- The facility is enclosed with fencing and gates to limit access and to increase the security of the facility from potential \"wrong-doers\".\n\n- Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal's etc.  Training is documented in each employees training record file.\n\n- Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\n\n     - A security service is employed to supervise the site\n\n     - A controlled pressure receiver accommodates daily operational swing capacity.\n\n- An evaporative cooling water sprinkler system has been installed over the receiver to reduce pressure during sustained hot weather.\n\n - An ammonia monitoring, sensing and warning system is installed.\n\n\n\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidental releases at the site over the last five years.  There is no data to report.\n\n\n\n1.5 The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elemen"

Production workers contracted by YEX are trained to notify and evacuate via the Plant's Emergency Action Plan.  Only the Rural Metro/Yuma Fire Department would respond to an emergency; support would be made available via WPS personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards.  Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  Written ammonia emergency response procedures are detailed in the facility's \"Thirty Minute Plan\".  Appropriate written plans are maintained on-site and updated on a regular basis.  Local Emergency Response capabilities have been verified.  \n\n\n\nWPS has also played a leading role instituting the Yuma-Area Ammonia Safety Day scheduled annually for November. Coolers, their personnel & numerous Fire Departments are included on the invitation list. Preventing, managing and responding to an ammonia emergency are regular topics. In this way, WPS has established relationships and a higher degree of coordination with Fire Departments that may be involved in ammonia response activities on an area-wide basis. WPS has been engaged with local emergency coordination efforts since February, 1994.\n\n  \n\n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n\n - Process Hazard Analysis revalidation or update;\n\n - Compliance Audits;\n\n - Routine maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\n\n - IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections;\n\n - WPS Inspection Protocol\n\n\n\nEach of the Programs above may result in recommendations ranging from capital improvements to routine maintenance of the plant.  Work Orders/Service Calls are established in parallel to identified needs.  Current planned changes to improve safety include recommendations from the PHA Update conducted March 20, 2014.  A written schedule has been prepared.  Resolution of the recommendations is expected by July 25, 2014.\n\n"
