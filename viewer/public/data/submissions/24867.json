      "SummaryText": "\nRisk Management Plan\n\nLa Francaise Bakery, Northlake Illinois\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\nLa Francaise Bakery in Northlake, Illinois a subsidiary of SCIS Food Services, Inc.,  is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing a variety of gourmet baked products to the food service industry.  La Francaise Bakery employs 400 people and manufactures products such as bagels, muffins, croissant rolls, Danish pastries and cinnamon rolls.  The principal raw materials used at the facility are wheat, flour and sugar.  For refrigeration and cooling, the company operates a mechanical refrigeration system charged with anhydrous ammonia.  The present capacity of the refrigeration system is 8,000 lbs and thus is below the threshold reporting capacity.  The company proposes to increase the capacity of its refrigeration system to 10,000 lbs of ammonia and has therefore developed and implemented a process safety management plan (\"PSM\") (29CFR 1910.119) and a risk management plan (\"RMP\") pursuant to US EPA regulation 40 CFR 68 under the Clean Air Act.\n\nLa Francaise Bakery purchases and stores anhydrous ammonia in bulk quantities for the refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia is received in bulk trucks on weekdays and during normal business hours.  Most people have encountered ammonia in common household cleaners or as a component of smelling  salts and recognize its strong, pungent odor.  Ammonia occurs naturally and is very important to animal and human life.  Though eighty percent of man-made (manufactured) ammonia is used as fertilizer, most of the ammonia in the environment comes from natural breakdown of manure, dead animals and decaying plants.  Ammonia is also extensively used as a refrigerant in industry since 1880's.\n\nAmmonia is a potentially hazardous chemical and it must be treated with respect.  The most likely way to get exposed to ammonia would be to breathe the fumes from spilled ammonia.  For example, if you spilled a bottle of concentrated ammonia in your house a"

      "SummaryText": "nd had to breathe the fumes while cleaning up, you may experience the symptoms of coughing and burning in the throat, and watery eyes because of irritation.  Exposure to high concentration of ammonia could cause burns to skin, eyes, throat and lungs.  At worst, these burns could be serious enough to be life threatening.  Usually the odor of ammonia will alert people to its presence before a concentration resulting in serious injury could be reached.\n\n\nApproach to Chemical Safety and Accident Prevention:\n\nThe Company backs up its commitment to safety by developing and implementing procedures for critical operations and communicating hazards of the process and chemicals used through Hazard Communication Programs.  The Company has ongoing safety programs implemented with the help of specialized consultants.  All safety programs are implemented under the direct supervision of senior management personnel.\n\n\n\nPursuant to the Risk Management Plan regulation and Process Safety Management standard, La Francaise Bakery has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect the employees and surrounding community from accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. The facility used a \"What-If\" technique for process hazard analysis (PHA).  Further the implementation of the PSM program includes education in the hazards of ammonia, preventive maintenance program\nfor the ammonia system, program for pre-startup safety reviews and management of change.  The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as hot working procedures) and contractor safety training.\n   \nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates La Francaise Bakery's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere was one reportable accident of ammonia being released i"

      "SummaryText": "n the past five years.  This accident occurred on June 21, 2000 and was due to the malfunction of a pressure relief valve on the high stage compressor Rc#1.  The area (engine room) was isolated, the operator immediately shut down the refrigeration system and the faulty relief valve was changed.  The system was then thoroughly tested by a licensed refrigeration contractor and company engineers before restarting.  The duration of release was approximately 15 minutes and quantity released was estimated to be less than 100 lbs. The fire department was called as a precautionary measure but did not participate in emergency response.  No evacuation of the surrounding community was necessary.  There were no injuries associated with this incident.\n \n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario:\n\nThe facility is located in a commercial and industrial section of the City of Northlake.  The expressway I-294 and I-290 are located on the west side at close proximity.  The setting is urban.\n\nThe worst case scenario is considered to be the rupture of the high pressure receiver, which contains most of the ammonia in the system at any given time.  It is considered that this rupture would cause loss of all the ammonia in the system over a period of 10 minutes at a constant rate. The toxic endpoint is taken to be an ERPG-2  of 0.14 mg/l. and was estimated to be 1.2 miles from the source. The consequences are modeled in atmospheric stability category F, at a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and a temperature of 77 degrees F.  The modelling has been developed by using EPA's RMP Comp software.  In the unlikely event of a tank rupture there will be offsite impact of the toxic chemical release.   The released ammonia fumes will travel in the direction of the wind.  The distance of travel will depend on the prevailing weather conditions.  Ammonia concentration will be significant so as to warrant the evacuation of surrounding population.\n\nIn a less severe but most like"

      "SummaryText": "ly situation referred to as a alternative scenario, a release can occur due to gasket rupture, pump seal leak, relief valve leak or broken hose equivalent to an orifice diameter of 1/4 to 1/2 inch.  A typical rate of release would be 100 lbs/minute and typical weather condition would be Atmospheric Stability Category D with a wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour.  The toxic end point of 650 feet was derived from the model plan as a typical urban site and the smallest rate of release would have minimal off-site impact.  Only the immediate neighboring facility will be affected and may need evacuation.  Passive mitigation to a release of 100 lbs/minute is considered to be the building housing the receiver.  Such a release could be contained until automatic and manual shutoff systems could be activated.  Responders could further mitigate the release by absorption in water from a fire hose, and neutralizing the resulting mixture with an acidic media or chemical.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nLa Francaise Bakery has updated its emergency response program to include response procedures \nin the event of accidental release of ammonia.  As required, various scenarios have been analyzed.\nCompany personnel are trained to respond to minor releases and minor repair/maintenance problems. \nHowever in the event of a release having offsite impact, the facility will work with a HAZMAT team\nof the Northlake Fire department to control the emergency and protect the surrounding community.  Notification will be done through the local police and fire department in case evacuation becomes necessary.  The facility has identified public receptors in the area of potential impact and this information is included in the emergency response plan.  A copy of the emergency response plan will be available with the Northlake fire department."
