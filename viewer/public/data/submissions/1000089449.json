Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nThe F. B. Purnell Sausage Co. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration systems at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Shelby County Department of Emergency Services, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 41,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration system is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPA's EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are u"

Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nF. B. Purnell Sausage Co. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nThe F. B. Purnell Sausage Co. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in the operating procedures associated with the system.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years, and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nThe F. B. Purnell Sausage Co. completes highly documented maintenance inspections and tests on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  The process equipment examined by these inspections and tests includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel complete maintenance activities with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance inspections and tests are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the F. B.

B. Purnell Sausage Co.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that the design, construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\n\n\nThe F. B. Purnell Sausage Co. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions required by the Risk Management Planning regulations are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are scheduled, assigned and completed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\n\n\nThe F. B. Purnell Sausage Co. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of Ammonia (anhydrous).  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n\n\nThe F. B.
