Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nSurlean Foods Company is committed to both the safety of our employees and that of the surrounding public, including both human health and the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful prevention measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our Prevention Program is the minimization of all risks that could possibly lead to an accidental release.  This program focuses primarily on the mechanical integrity of the process equipment and the training of its operators.  The Emergency Action Plan focuses on minimizing the potential impacts of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the San Antonio Fire Department and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper actions to an emergency situation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n* Surlean Foods Company is a meat processing plant\n* The regulated substance handled at this plant is ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the plant cooler and freezer system.\n* The maximum quantity of ammonia is stored at this facility is 36,000 pounds.\n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst-case Scenario:  Failure of the high pressure receiver for the main engine room when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 14,000 pounds of ammonia.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of the vessel to 50%.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor over a ten minute time span and are subjected to a wind speed of 1.5 m/s with a stability class of F.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario is 0.7 miles\n\nAlternative Scenario:  The lifting of a pressure relief valve on the ammonia storage vessel for the new engine room.  Releif valves allow the escape of ammonia at a total flo"

      "SummaryText": "w reate of 101.4 lbs/min.  Weather conditions are assumed to be average values of 3 m/s wind speed and stability class D.  The valves are assumed to be open 75% of the time during the release as pressure builds and is relieved.  The distance to this endpoint is 0.1 miles and extends beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nSurlean Foods Company believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety.  This facility maintains information about the proper use of its equipment and possible hazards.  By following set operating procedures and maintenance routines, the process equipment within the facility will continue to operate in optimum condition.  Additionally, the release prevention program is constantly being improved by sustained employee training and regular compliance audits.  Compliance with all applicable state codes and regulations ensures the continued safety of Surlean Foods Company.\n\n5. Five year accident history\n\nIn the last five years, the Surlean Foods Company facility has not experienced a significant accidental ammonia release.\n\n6. The Emergency Action Plan\n\nA well planned emergency action program can make a tremendous difference in the potential off-site impacts of an accidental release.  Swift, efficient actions can minimize the damage to both human population and the natural surroundings.  To this end, Surlean Foods Company has coordinated emergency response efforts with the San Antonio Fire Department and has instructed employees on the proper actions to take in the event of accidental release.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe are no planned changes to improve safety at this time"
