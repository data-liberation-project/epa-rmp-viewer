This commitment   is  demonstrated  by  the   resources invested  in accident prevention, such as training personnel  and considering safety in  the  design, installation,  operation, and maintenance  of  our process.  Our  policy  is to implement  reasonable controls\tto  prevent  foreseeable  releases   of\nregulated  substances. However, if a release  does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n The   Dollarhide  Gas  Plant,  located  35  miles southwest  of Andrews (Andrews County), Texas,  on Highway   128,  operates  a  process  to\tproduce\npetroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids),  from  natural gas. The  Dollarhide  Gas Plant  has several regulated flammables,  such  as propane and butane. The Dollarhide Gas Plant  does not   use  and/or  process  any  regulated   toxic substances above threshold quantities.\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n The  WCS  associated with a release of  flammable substances in the Program Level 1 process  at  the gas   plant  is  a  vapor  cloud  explosion  (VCE) involving the full inventory of the product  surge tank  containing  natural gas  liquids  (flammable mixture). A written procedure is in place to limit the  tank  inventory to 100,000 lbs. (80%  of  the maximum  tank  capacity); therefore,  the  reduced inventory  is  assumed  to  release  and\tignite,\nresulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi  endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 mile, resulting in  no  offsite impact. Although we have  numerous controls  to prevent such releases and  to  manage their   consequences,  no   credit\tfor\tpassive\nmitigation  measures  was taken  into  account  in eval"

The following is a  summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because the process at the gas plant  that is   regulated  by  the  Environmental  Protection Agency's  (EPA's)  risk management  program  (RMP) regulation  is  also subject to  the  Occupational Safety   and\tHealth  Administration's   (OSHA's)\nprocess  safety  management (PSM)  standard,  this summary  addresses each of the OSHA  PSM  elements and  describes the management system in  place  to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n The Dollarhide Gas Plant encourages employees  to participate  in  all  facets  of  process   safety management  and accident prevention.  Examples  of employee  participation range  from  updating  and compiling   technical   documents   and\tchemical\ninformation  to participating as  a  member  of  a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access  to all information created as part of  the gas  plant  accident prevention program.  Specific ways  that  employees  can  be  involved  in\tthe\naccident prevention program are documented  in  an employee participation plan that is maintained  at the   gas   plant  and  addresses  each\taccident\nprevention program element. In addition,  the  gas plant  has a number of initiatives under way  that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both   process  and  personal  safety.  The  teams typically have members from various areas  of  the plant,\tincluding\toperations,    maintenance,\nengineering, and plant management.\nProcess Safety Information\n The  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant keeps  a  variety  of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe  operation  of the process.

A  table  summarizing\tthe\nreference documents and their location is  readily available   as   part  of  the  written\temployee\nparticipation  plan to help employees  locate  any necessary process safety information.\n Chemical-specific\tinformation,      including\nexposure  hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in  material safety  data  sheets (MSDSs). This information  is supplemented   by   documents  that   specifically address  known  corrosion concerns and  any  known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing  of chemicals.  For  specific process areas,  the  gas plant  has  documented safety-related  limits  for specific  process  parameters (e.g.,  temperature, level,  composition)  in a Key  Process  Parameter Document.  The gas plant ensures that the  process is  maintained  within these limits using  process controls   and   monitoring  instruments,   highly trained\tpersonnel,  and  protective   instrument\nsystems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n The  gas  plant also maintains numerous technical documents  that  provide  information  about\tthe\ndesign and construction of process equipment.

Collectively,  these prevention   program   activities   help   prevent potential accident scenarios that could be  caused by equipment failures and human errors.\nSpecialized Safety Features\n The  Dollarhide Gas Plant has safety features  on many  units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2)  quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce  the consequences   of  (mitigate)   a   release.\tThe\nfollowing types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n Release Detection\n\u00b7     Hydrocarbon  detectors with alarms  in  the\n\tengine room.\n \u00b7    H2S Monitors\n \u00b7    Ultra Violet detection in engine room\n Release Containment/Control\n \u00b7     Process relief valves that discharge  to  a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\u00b7     Valves  to permit isolation of the  process\n\t(manual or automated)\n\u00b7     Automated  shutdown  systems  for  specific\nprocess parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\u00b7      Redundant  equipment  and  instrumentation\n (e.g.,  uninterruptible power supply for process\n\tcontrol system, backup firewater pump)\n  \u00b7\tAtmospheric relief devices.\n Release Mitigation\n\u00b7    Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n \u00b7\tDeluge system for specific equipment\n\u00b7     Trained  personnel  in  emergency  response\n\tprocedures\n \u00b7\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., chemical\nprotective  clothing,  self-contained  breathing apparatus)\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n The  Dollarhide Gas Plant has an excellent record (no  incidents that resulted in onsite or  offsite effects)  of accident prevention over the  past  5 years.   If  an  incident  did  occur,  we   would investigate   the"

The program consists  of  procedures for\tresponding  to  a  release  of  a  regulated\nsubstance, including the possibility of a fire  or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all  aspects  of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation  plans and  accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response  agencies and  the  public  if a release occurs,  and  post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of  emergency response  equipment, as well as instructions  that address  the use of emergency response  equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures  as necessary  to  perform  their  specific  emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to  the gas plant process or other Dollarhide  Gas Plant facilities.\n The  overall emergency response program  for  the Dollarhide  Gas  Plant  is  coordinated  with  the Andrews  County,  Texas, local emergency  planning committee   (LEPC).  This  coordination\tincludes\nperiodic meetings of the committee, which includes local    emergency   response   officials,   local government      officials,      and\tindustry\nrepresentatives.  The  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant  has around-the-clock  communications  capability  with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency  response organizations   (e.g.,  fire   department).   This\nprovides  a  means of notifying the public  of  an incident,  if  necessary, as well as  facilitating quick  response  to an"

In  addition  to periodic  LEPC meetings, the Dollarhide Gas  Plant conducts  periodic emergency drills that the  LEPC and  emergency response organizations are  invited to  participate  in,  and the gas  plant  annually provides information to local emergency responders regarding  the hazards of regulated substances  in the gas plant.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n The  Dollarhide Gas Plant resolves  all  findings from  PHAs,  some of which result in modifications to the process. The following types of changes are planned  over  the next few years in  response  to PHA,  safety  audit,  and  incident  investigation findings:\n\u00b7    Change out the fired heater for better burner\n\tmanagement and safety\n\u00b7     Replacing  the 1950 model compressors  with\n\tmore efficient units\n \u00b7\tDisposal of asbestos"
