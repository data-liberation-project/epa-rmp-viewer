Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Reser's Fine Foods, Inc. to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \r\n\r\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\n1.1. We have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with state and federal regulations.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\r\n\r\n* Reser's Fine Foods, Inc. is a food manufacturing facility that stores and distributes refrigerated foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees and visitors, management personnel, and contractors.\r\n* The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\r\n* The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory"

The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \r\n\r\nReser's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.   This plan will be reviewed and updated as necessary by the Reser's Fine Foods, Inc. Risk Management Department. \r\n\r\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.   Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.  Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \r\n\r\n\r\n1.40 Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nOn 12/19/2007, the EPA was notified of an Anhydrous Ammonia release of < 1500 pounds.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.50 Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nReser's Fine Foods, Inc. has a written Emergency Response Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.
