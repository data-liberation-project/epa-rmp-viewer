Anhydrous ammonia is a necessary product in the manufacturing of nitrogenous fertilizer. Many safety precautions, procedures, and policies are in practice to provide a safe and healthy work environment for our employees and nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and County rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility along with the safe handling procedures that we use and the extensive training of our personnel.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe primary objective of Nitram is to produce nitrogenous fertilizer.  The majority of our production is high-density prilled ammonium nitrate used in the agricultural market as a fertilizer.  Also, a small amount of our production goes into low-density prilled ammonium nitrate. \n\nOur plant receives anhydrous ammonia via The Tampa Bay Pipeline.  After the ammonia is received into the plant it is stored in five tanks with a maximum fill capacity of 82%.  The total authorized storage capacity on site is 492 tons.\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each scenario:\n\n* Worst-Case Scenario - Failure of a large 150 ton storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 123 tons of ammonia.  Company policy limits the maximum fill capacity of our tanks to 82%.  The accidental release of ammonia from such a tank would pose a risk of respiratory and tissue damage. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 1.65 miles. \n\n* Alternative Scenario - This scenario is based on an accidental release of a line break or a val"

This time was considered sufficient to either isolate and empty a process line or repair a leak.   The alternative case release impact distance does not extend beyond the facility property. \n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and The Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's \"Risk Management Plan\", OSHA's \"Process Safety Management\", DEP's \"Tank Inspection Rule\", and conducts initial and annual OSHA's \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" training for all operational and maintenance personnel.\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:\n\nWe had an accidental release of approximately 150 pounds of ammonia on December 19, 1997.  \n\nThe release quickly dissipated with no personal injuries on-site or off-site.\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nNitram's mechanics, operators, supervisors, superintendents, and managers have received Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Technician level training, and are required to attend an eight hour annual refresher class.  In addition, annual Spill Prevention and Response training is required. \n\n\tThe company has a Written Emergency Response Plan in the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) manual and is included in our Spill Prevention and Control Reporting of Releases of Hazardous Materials Procedure. \n\n\tEmergency office, home and cell phone numbers for responsible managers and superintendents are listed in our emergency procedures and HAZWOPER manual\n\n\tAlso, clearly defined procedures and instructions are provided to notify the proper emergency, Federal, State, and Local agencies should a release occur.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety:\n\nSince 1992 tremendous financial and personnel resources were expended to implement OSHA's Process Safety Management.  All elements of that safety standard ha"
