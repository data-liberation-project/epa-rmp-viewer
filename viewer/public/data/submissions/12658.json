BASF also believes in being a responsible corporate citizen and maintaining open, constructive dialogue with our neighbors.  These principles are an integral part of our corporate vision statement and values.  We believe that sharing this information with our neighbors makes good sense.  By doing so, we believe the community will better understand how safe and ecologically sound BASF operations are.\n\nPolicies\n\nBASF Corporation has the following Corporate Guidelines related to environmental, health and safety:\n\n7 We produce products that are safe to manufacture, use and dispose of.\n7 We assist our customers to use our products safely and in an environmentally sound manner.  We provide them with information on correct handling of our products.\n7 We minimize the impact on mankind and the environment during production, storage, transportation, marketing and use of our products.\n7 Economic considerations do not take priority over environmental protection, health and safety.\n7 An important contribution to \"Sustainable Development\" is our involvement in the \"Responsible Care\" initiative worldwide.  This applies to our products and services in all our businesses and affiliates.\n7 We are committed to making continuous improvements in safety, health and environmental protection.  We do this acting on our own initiative and in consultation with recognized regulatory authorities.

Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Livonia Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Livonia Site uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) .  This chemical is used to manufacture many common products. The major use of TDI is for urethane production. BASF sells TDI to the urethane industry. Other companies use TDI in various processes to produce urethane products such as:\n7 Furniture and bedding\n7 Home Insulation\n7 Toys\n7 Automotive seats\n7 Carpet padding\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\n7 Liquid spill and vaporization of Toluene Diisocyanate with off-site impacts.   \n\nAlternative\n\n7 Release of Toluene Diisocyanate from a relief device with off-site impacts.  This senario does not take into account that the rail car is parked in a railsiding area that is enclosed to the west, north, south, above and below. The TDI rail car is approximately 150 feet from the opening at the east end. Due to the vapor density of TDI, most likely little, to no, vapors would escape the rail area in this scenario. There also are video cameras in the railsiding to assist the operators in monitoring the rail car.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program and the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code.\n \n BASF Livonia uses a variety of safety equipment and procedures to prevent accidental releases. Following are some of the typical safety equipment and systems used at our facility.\n\n7 Automatic shut-off devices and relief valves handle unexpected rises in temperature or pressure.\n7 Safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutdown systems and vapor detectors, pr"

There were no off-site impacts. \n Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Livonia Fire Department. All BASF Livonia site production personnel have received 40 hours of Emergency Response training. These employees are recertified yearly through competency testing and refresher training.  Drills are also conducted regularly. All new employees receive training on the BASF Livonia Site Emergency Response Plan as well as all other safety procedures prior to beginning work.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, etc."
