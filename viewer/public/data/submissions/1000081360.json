These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\r\n\r\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nIn this accidental release scenario, the anhydrous ammonia high pressure receiver (HPR) on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.  This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the area where the HPR is located).  It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event.  However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded.  This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely.  In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 12,000-pounds of anhydrous ammonia could be released (in the worst-case).  \r\n\r\nSince the release would occur inside the Refrigeration Machinery Room, the effects of Building Attenuation were considered in determining the projected vulnerable zone. Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 1.8-miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative-Release Scenarios\r\nAlternative accidental release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur (than the worst-case release scenario) are those which may result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 1,000-pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  These scenarios include situations such as accidental releases during anhydrous ammonia delivery to- or loading of- the high pressure receiver at the facility, pinhole leaks in either the high pressure or low pressure anhydrous ammonia transfer piping (which contain anhydrous ammonia in either liquid or vapor phase),"
