This document comprises the Executive Summary for the Facility's Five Year Update of each of these two Programs.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (also known as the Federal Risk Management Plan Regulations) and the California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Article 3, Section 2745.3 (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan - CalARP RMP Regulations).  The scope of the Federal RMP and CalARP RMP includes all operations conducted at CPFD's Stockton Facility that involve the storage, handling and/or use of anhydrous ammonia (i.e., anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the facility above the threshold quantity).  This document contains the necessary information to satisfy the EPA Risk Management Program and the CalARP Program regulations for facilities handling regulated substances in excess of the listed threshold quantity.  Specifically, this document consists of the Executive Summary as required by 40 CFR Part 68.155 (19 CCR ?2745.3) and the Data Elements/RMPeSubmit forms as required by 40 CFR Part 68.160 - 180 (19 CCR ?2745.4 - .8).  Finally, this document contains the certification page required by 40 CFR Part 68.185 (19 CCR ?2745.9).\n\n\n\nCPFD is strongly committed to the health and safety of its employees, the public and the environment.

The facility lies approximately 1.4-miles east of Interstate 5 in an area comprised primarily of agricultural and industrial facilities. The small town of French Camp is located about 1 mile southwest of the facility. The Stockton Metropolitan Airport lies approximately a ? mile east of the plant. State Highway 99 runs east-west and the closest point to the plant is about 2.5-miles to the east.  The facility also lies very close to the Union Pacific railroad tracks.  \n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nCPFD's Stockton facility stores and distributes various food and non-food related supplies and encompasses approximately 500,000-square feet of space.  A portion of the Stockton Warehouse and Distribution Center space is refrigerated and cold storage.  \n\n\n\nDescription of Facility's Use of Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes an anhydrous ammonia based, single stage mechanical refrigeration system that utilizes a flooded liquid evaporator feed.  The refrigeration system contains approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia (the only regulated substance handled at the SUPO Plant) in a closed loop process.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, and cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) to provide space refrigeration / cooling.

The maintenance of the system is contracted to a qualified refrigeration contractor. \n\n\n\nWater Based Anhydrous Ammonia Diffusion System\n\nALL system pressure relief valves are piped to a main header and into an above-ground water storage tank (with approximate volume of 15,600-gallons of water).  All pressure relief valves are piped to the diffusion tank for mixing with water in the event of a release from one of the system's pressure relief valves.  The water in the diffusion tank provides scrubbing of the anhydrous ammonia vapor prior to discharge to the atmosphere.  This virtually eliminates offsite impacts from potential pressure relief events.\n\n\n\nSite Security\n\nA chain link fence surrounds the facility.  Additionally, the facility is protected via manned 24-hour security.  These site security provisions are intended to prevent unauthorized access to facility areas.  Lastly, the refrigeration machinery room is locked at all times and can only be accessed by authorized personnel. \n\n\n\nES 2.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n\n\n?    the worst-case release; and\n\n?    an alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case rel"

These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\n\n\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nIn this accidental release scenario, the anhydrous ammonia high pressure receiver (HPR) on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.  This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the area where the HPR is located).  It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event.  However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded.  This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely.  In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 12,000-pounds of anhydrous ammonia could be released (in the worst-case).  \n\n\n\nSince the release would occur inside the Refrigeration Machinery Room, the effects of Building Attenuation were considered in determining the projected vulnerable zone. Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 1.8-miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative-Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative accidental release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur (than the worst-case release scenario) are those which may result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 1,000-pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  These scenarios include situations such as accidental releases during anhydrous ammonia delivery to- or loading of- the high pressure receiver at the facility, pinhole leaks in either the high pressure or low pressure anhydrous ammonia transfer piping (which contain anhydrous ammonia in either liquid or vapor phase), "

In order to be conservative in the estimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that approximately 1,000-pounds of anhydrous ammonia (in liquid phase) is released due to a 0.25-inch pinhole leak in an ammonia liquid transfer line over a 60-minute time period.  The resulting release of ammonia vapor was assumed to freely migrate off-site.  Utilizing the USEPA's Reference Tables, the distance to endpoint for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 0.8-miles.\n\n\n\nES 3.0    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the five years preceding submittal of the Federal RMP/CalARP RMP, the facility has NOT had any releases of anhydrous ammonia that have resulted in:\n\n?
