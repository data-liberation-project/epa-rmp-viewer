If neither of two can be reached then the local fire department, who have been trained in handling NH3 emergencies, should be contacted.\nThis information should be given:\n    A.  name and telephone number of the person giving the report \n    B.  estimate how much was released\n    C.  location of the release\n    D.  time and duration of the release\n    E.  precautions taken, such as an evacuation\n    F.  any known acute or chronic health risks which may result from the release\n\n\n\nOur facility and the regulated substances handled---\n\nOur NH3 tanks are located in the Northwest corner of our faciltiy.  Our facility is a fertilizer, chemical, feed and seed retail store.  We handle bulk chemicals as well as packaged chemical.  We blend bulk dry fertilizer for agricultural  use only. We sell bulk and bagged feed for livestock and sell seed  for agricultural use.  We also sell bulk liquid fertilizer and NH3."
