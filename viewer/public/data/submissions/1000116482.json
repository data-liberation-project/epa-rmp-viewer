The Facility process and packages fruit and vegetable products. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the Facility's Plant 1 and Plant 2 refrigeration system processes. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDole has developed a California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program in general accordance with the requirements of California Code of Regulations Title 19, Division 5. California Environmental Protection Agency, Chapter 2, and Federal EPA requirements, 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan (RMP), and federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119 and California OSHA 8 CCR 5189  to enhance existing anhydrous ammonia safety and emergency response programs. Dole is committed to worker and public safety through investment in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration systems. Dole's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Dole has developed an Emergency Response Plan to respond to a release of ammonia in the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the Facility.\n\nProcess Description\nDole has two anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at the Facility to support its primary operation of processing and freezing fruit. The refrigeration processes are separated between Plant 1 and Plant 2. Plant 1 and Plant 2 are two-stage closed-loop ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nThe Plant 1 refrigeration system process is composed of the following key components:\nHigh stage compressors\nBooster compressors\nCondensers\nHPR\nAnhydrator\nIntercoolers\nRecirculator packages\nEvaporators \nHeat Exchangers\n\nThe Plant 2 re"

The ERP provides Facility personnel general guidelines and procedures in preparing for and responding to emergency situations that may occur at the Facility, such as responding to a fire, an unplanned or accidental release of a hazardous material, medical emergencies, bomb threats, site evacuation, etc. The ERP also provides resources for agency notification, coordination among Facility personnel and outside responders, and internal and/or external use in emergency planning/preparedness. Emergency response actions are coordinated with local emergency response agencies annually.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nDole performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in April 2020 and generated a list of re"

Dole will address PHA recommendations within the 2 \u00bd-year time frame set forth in the January 1, 2015, CalARP requirements. These changes to improve safety include:\n\u0095\tP2-RC01 and RC02 motor rebuilds \n\u0095\tAdding Ammonia horn and strobes in Production areas and freezers where ammonia \n        equipment/piping is present\n\u0095\tUpgrade Recirculator Control panels in order to phase out obsolete panels\n\u0095\tUpgrade main refrigeration PLC in order to phase out obsolete PLC\n\u0095\tInstall catwalk for all Blast 15 evaporators for cleaning and inspection access \n\u0095\tReplace Cyber key access to Badge scanners access for critical rooms such as Ammonia \n        Engine Rooms, Recirculator Rooms, and Boiler Rooms \n\u0095\tUpgrade current Cornell pumps to hermetically sealed Cornell pumps for P1-RP03, P2-RP32, \n        and P2-IQF4&5-RP01 \n\u0095\tReplace Hansen level probes to danfoss cable style for more accurate level readings. \n\u0095\tReplace Plant 2 HX04 and Plant 2 HX05 with a Plate and frame (small footprint) package \n\u0095\tReplace Plant 2 Condensers P2- EC01, EC04, EC03, and EC05\n\n\nManagement responses and actions will be consistent with Dole's commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operation. Dole recognizes that the CalARP/RMP/PSM program is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its Facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Dole continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Dole will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the CalARP/RMP/PSM program, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Dole's practices, and Dole will maintain the most current version onsite.
