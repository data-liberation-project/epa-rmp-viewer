We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck transport, is handled and stored on-site, and is a substance regulated by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,050 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThis facility maintains approximately 35 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and 3 1,050-gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 178,160 pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 2 stationary storage tanks [1 @ 18,000 gallons; 1 @ 30,000 gallons] on site.  The maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tanks is 224,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity is 402,160 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 140,000 pounds.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the"

According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact. \nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end point off-site. The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds. This release scenario (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes, as well as the Indiana State Chemist's regulations for anhydrous ammonia storage facilities.  This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutoff valves. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All main storage tank valves and riser valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and according to the guidelines in the ANSI sta"

The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification, and on the job training.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, including evacuations on or off-site.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThis facility has an emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 1910.38. In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have  coordinated response actions with the Otterbein and Oxford Fire Departments, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training. In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. We have discussed this program with the Benton County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and our  facility is included in the county emergency plan. In the event of a release of regulated substances, our employees have been instructed on the  procedures for notification of the local fire authority, emergency personnel,  and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at our facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. This facility is  in compliance with the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 standard. The Indiana State Chemist also requires us to have the facility in full compliance with the new state regulations by February 1, 2003.
