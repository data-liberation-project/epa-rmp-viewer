Likewise, compliance with environmental programs is a key responsibility of every RG Steel employee in accordance with their roles and responsibility within the organization.\n\nRG Steel, LLC will maintain health, safety, and environmental (HSE) programs conforming to the best practices of global manufacturing organizations.  These practices include policies for accidental release prevention and emergency response and shall be implemented within the framework of our ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certified management systems.\n\n\nOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of iron and steel.   An annealing process is performed at several finishing operations as part of the manufacturing of sheet steel. Annealing is a heat treatment wherein a material is altered, causing changes in its properties such as strength and hardness.  This process is performed by substantially heating the material for a while and allowing it to cool. \n\nAnnealing is carried out in a special atmosphere, either hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen.   Annealing gas is produced for the steel mill by blending together nitrogen and hydrogen gas. The hydrogen is supplied from three liquid hydrogen storage tanks that have a capacity of 18,150 gallons each.  One tank is located at the Cold Sheet Mill Operation where the hydrogen annealing"
