Because of the nature of ice-cream based products, the manufacturing process at Ben & Jerry's includes refrigeration systems to ensure that the ice cream products remain in their intended frozen states.\n\n\n\nBen & Jerry's utilizes two types of refrigeration systems:  anhydrous ammonia and ethylene glycol.  The anhydrous ammonia triggers the requirements of EPA 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan, because the facility's refrigeration system has 60,663 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nBen & Jerry's Homemade, Inc. is involved in an ongoing effort to comply with OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management requirements as well as EPA 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan for accident prevention planning, training, and, response.  Our facility is located at 900 Industrial Park Road, St. Alban's, Vermont 05478.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario involves failure of the High Pressure Receiver containing 14,863 lbs. of ammonia with 10 minute release.  The toxic endpoint was determined by RMPComp. The ammonia would travel 1.5 miles to dispersing enough to no longer posing a hazard.\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Case Scenario involves failure of relief valve resulting in a release of 3,483 pounds of ammonia with 10 minute release.  The toxic endpoint was determined by RMPComp.  The ammonia would travel .1 mile to dispersing enough to no longer posing a hazard.\n\n\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressure reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\n\n\nThis facility has not experienced any reportable accidents in the past five ("

The Ben & Jerry's St. Alban's facility works with Vermont District 4 Local Emergency Planning Committee in the event of an emergency. \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include the ongoing preventative maintenance program, and regular replacement of deteriorated system components.  Employee level of awareness is enhanced by regular training programs and exercises."
