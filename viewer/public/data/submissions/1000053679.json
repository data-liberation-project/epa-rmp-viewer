Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Washington Fruit to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. \n\n\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC 296-67-017. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-62-3112. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\n\nWashington Fruit, River Road Plant is a fruit storage and distribution facility. Storage and distribution requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the fruits. This refrigeration processes use ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 15,500 pounds of a"

There is no standby or makeup inventory kept onsite.\n\n\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nWashington Fruit complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations. \n\n\n\nWashington Fruit, River Road's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration systems include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA). Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system. This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia. Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons. \n\n\n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility is a new construction facility, and therefore has not had any significant or reportable release of ammonia at the facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.60 Emergency Action Program\n\n\n\nWashington Fruit, River Road has "

It complies with the provisions of WISHA Emergency Response regulations, WAC 296-62-3112. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at the Washington Fruit River Road site and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency. The refrigeration processes have back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n\n\nEmergency Alarm and Communication System\n\nSafe Rooms, Evacuation Plans, and Assembly Points\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance are established with the Yakima Fire Department, including the Yakima Regional HazMat Team stationed in Yakima. The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n\n\nAll Washington Fruit, River Road personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. \n\n\n\nThis plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n\n\n1.70 Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThis facility started production operations in 2010.
