The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Central Region Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committees they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 226,000 pounds in the facility's two tanks.  The capacity of the tanks are, 133,000 pounds and 93,000 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario:  This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.
