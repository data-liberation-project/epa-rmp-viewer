      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTapia Bros Inc. utilizes chlorination systems on some of the ranches to control algae growth in the irrigation systems.  The chlorination systems incorporate many inherently safe design features.  These features include fail safe (vacuum open and spring close) flow valves in the vacuum feed regulator and ejectors that fail in the closed position.  As such, the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nWhile it is Tapia Bros Inc.\u00bfs objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited personnel in the farming operation precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the Tapia Bros Inc. farming operations where chlorine is used and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nTapia Bros Inc. has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the RMP regulations.  At least every three years, Tapia Bros Inc. will audit these programs and any findings of noncompliance will be documented and responded to and the deficiencies will be corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nTapia Bros Inc. owns and leases farmland to grow onions.  To ensure that the irrigation systems work properly, some of the ranches utilize chlorine to control the growth of algae.  In these chlorination systems, chlorine is drawn from ton containers through vacuum feed regulators by a vacuum created by ejectors installed on the irrigation water pipeline.  Rotameters are installed in the vacuum tubing between the vacuum feed regulator and each ejector to regulate the flow of chlorine into the irrigation water.  This arrangement chlorinates the irrigation water only when there is water flow through the ejectors. \n\nDuring normal operation, two one ton containers may be connected to the"

The Operations Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nTapia Bros Inc. has not had any accidental releases from any of the chlorination systems that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nTapia Bros Inc. has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Tapia Bros Inc. regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety.  Currently, Tapia Bros Inc. does not have any additional changes planned to improve safety."
