The toxic chemical threshold quantities, which were met to identify the facility, relate to the stored amounts of chlorine.  The ARP/RMP Act delineates three (3) specific levels of processes.  Of the three levels defined, the City's AWTF qualifies as a Level 3 Process facility.  As a result of this designation, the facility is required to address specific process safety criteria in the Risk Management Program.  This information and other pertinent information are included in the City's RMP document.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the City of Tarpon Springs Risk Management Program (RMP) is to provide information that will define action(s) that will effectively prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment and mitigate the severity of any accidental releases that might occur.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these objectives, the Risk Management Program presents information for the City's Level 3 processes and outlines the emergency response program for the facility.\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nThe City of Tarpon Springs takes a proactive approach to safety and compliance with all State and Federal rules and regulations.  Pertinent AWTF staff members have completed comprehensive training courses related to the proper use, handling, storage, and emergency response procedures associated with chlorine.  The City's Risk Management Program specifically addresses staff activities for various scenarios related to potential leaks and emergency situations, while placing emphasis on predictive maintenance and preventing accidental chemical releases.

The chlorine solution is injected into the filtered effluent flow as the water enters the chlorine contact chamber.  The chlorine solution dose is determined using an ultrasonic meter that measures the flow of the filtered effluent.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine contact chamber serves to provide the detention time needed for high level disinfection requirements.  Effluent flow from the contact chamber flows to two (2) two million-gallon (2.0 MG) reuse water ground storage tanks.  After the ground storage tanks fill to their maximum capacity, the effluent level in the chlorine contact chamber increases until it overflows, or is automatically controlled by the facility's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, to a transmission pipe, which discharges at the Anclote River outfall.\r\n\r\nPrior to discharge to the Anclote River, the effluent is dechlorinated using liquid sodium bisulfite at two locations. \r\n\r\nThe chlorination process is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 Level 3 requirements for the following three reasons:  \r\n\r\n1.\tThe process stores regulated substance of chlorine above the threshold quantities;\r\n\r\n2.\tThe process has the potential to impact public receptors (both human and environmental) within the distance to an endpoint from a worst-case release; and \r\n\r\n3.\tThe process is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulations.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a sufficient amount on-site for treatment, seven (7) 2,000-lbs. chlorine cylinders are present at the AWTF at all times.  The cylinder containers are stored in an elevated 17 by 31-foot concrete building, approximately 70 feet west of the operations building.

The entry gates are monitored at both locations within the control building using video surveillance equipment and an intercom system, which is used to grant or deny access to the facility. Security fencing was also installed around chlorine building to form another barrier of security within the facility.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,video surveillance equipment is in use at the chlorine storage building and monitors the chemical feed equipment.  Installation of this equipment has provided an effective means to monitor the storage buildings, ensuring authorized personnel are safe and providing notice of unauthorized persons in the areas.  The video monitoring also provides staff with additional ability to detect equipment malfunctions. \r\n\r\nImages of these locations are displayed on a designated monitor located in the operational control building and at a shared monitor located in the reception area.\r\n\r\nThe facility and the substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe City is permitted to operate a domestic wastewater treatment plant, permit #FL0030406, by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).
