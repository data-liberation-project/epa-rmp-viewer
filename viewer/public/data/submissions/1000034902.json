Stutsman, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Washington County LEPC, local fire departments, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2)  Facility Information:\n\n\n\nThe sole activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed from this facility for direct application as a fertilizer for crop production.  In June of 2009, the system was improved by the installation of a bulkhead.  The bulkhead serves only to improve the safety of the system.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity stored at the facility would be 440,000 lbs in a combination of bulk storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3)  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,530 lbs. which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point is 2.6 miles.\n\n\n\nThe most likely alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose from a tanker.  The maximum quantity release would be 46,400 lbs.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.9 miles.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of such a release, emergency shut-down systems including a remote manual shut-off valve, in-line excess-flow automatic shut-down, and load-out riser break-away systems would be utilized to minimize the release.\n\n\n\n4)  The Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National St"

As required by SARA Title III (EPCRA), the State of Iowa, the Washington County Emergency Management Agency, and the local fire department have been provided with the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know information.  The telephone number for the Washington County LEPC is (641) 622-2528.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\nFor further information contact:  Dave Henderson, Safety & Compliance Officer, Eldon C.
