Therefore, two processes (pentane storage and LPG material storage and handling) with flammable substances are subject to RMP requirements.\n\n3. Worst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nThere are two processes subject to RMP; Pentane plus storage and Flammable liquid (propane) handling and storage.  Both processes are evaluated to determine the worst case scenario.\n\n   a.Flammable Liquid (Pentane)\n\nIn May 1999, EPA issued a direct final rule revising the worst-case release scenario analysis methods for regulated flammable substances.  The most recent changes allow the facility to consider passive mitigation (i.e., containment) for flammable liquids at ambient temperature.  Pentane is normally liquid at ambient temperature.  Therefore, it is assumed that the entire quantity in the vessel is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  The release rate to the air is the volatilization rate from a pool that spreads out into a diked area.  The total quantity that becomes vapor in the first ten minutes is reported as the quantity released that is available for a vapor cloud explosion.  Other assumptions for the worst-case analysis included: 10% of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion (i.e., the yield factor is 0.10).  Mathematical algorithms were used to determine the distance to endpoint at an overpressure level of one pound per square inch (psi), with a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability being classified as F (stable).  The nearfield dispersion environment was determined to be urban in accordance with the requirements of 40CFR 68.22(e).  The results of the assessment for the pentane storage tank show that the 1 psi overpressure endpoint occurs at a distance of 0.42 miles from the release point. There are public receptors within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n  b. Flammable Gases (Propane)\n\nAccording to EPA's RMP gui"

It is our policy to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program and adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as the training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to prevent releases of substances.  If a release does occur, the operator's personnel, supplemented by local fire department will respond to control the effects of the release and to evacuate potentially affected personnel if needed.\n\n2.Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nCMS Energy is the principal partner for MUST and MFP located in Marysville, Michigan.  Marysville Gas Liquids Company (a CMS Energy subsidiary) is responsible for the continuing operation and maintenance of the facility.  MUST consists of ten underground caverns for storage of liquid hydrocarbon.  Inbound and outbound deliveries are accomplished by tank truck, rail car and connections to nine liquid product pipelines.  Various LPG, natural gas liquids and refinery liquid streams can be processed into five commercial products (i.e., HD-5 propane, normal butane, iso-butane, C5 - C6 fuel and C7 + fuel) through the fractionation process.  The materials processed at Marysville are highly flammable and a sufficient quantity is present such that the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP) apply.  In certain cases toxic compounds (i.e., hydrogen sulphide, mercaptans) are present as contaminants in either t"

      "SummaryText": "dance for facilities storing and processing flammable substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature, the worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F for propane), which then results in a vapor cloud explosion.  The entire contents of the cloud is assumed to be within the flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to explode.  For the worst-case analysis, 10% of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion (i.e., the yield factor is 0.10).  Consequence analysis algorithms were used to determine the distance to the endpoint at an overpressure level of one pound per square inch (psi).  Other assumptions for the worst-case analysis included:  the storage vessel is not diked; no passive mitigation system is in place; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for the propane bullet tank show that the 1 psi overpressure endpoint occurs at a distance of 0.56 miles from the release point.  There are public receptors within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the facility is a release that occurs as a result of a leak in the propane dryer.  To estimate the impact distance for this alternative-release scenario, a vapor cloud fire was assumed to occur.  The distance to the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) represents the maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects of a fire might have serious consequences.  The LFL for propane is 36 mg/L (EPA guidance document).  ENSR assumed that propane is a dense gas and that the nearfield dispersion environment is determined to be urban.  There are public receptors within the distance to the calculated endpoint (0.1 miles).\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe proce"
