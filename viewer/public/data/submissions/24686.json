      "SummaryText": "At Celanese, we are dedicated to being an industry leader in protecting the environment, the health, and safety of both our employees and the communities in which we operate.  Like our community neighbors, the people who work at the Bucks site want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why Celanese has a \"zero incident\" goal.  We are committed to reducing emissions and continuously improving our performance toward zero injuries and zero environmental and process incidents.\n\nThe Celanese Bucks site began operations in 1970.  We have approximately 52 employees and 8 resident contractors.  We manufacture five amine products for Celanese and operate production facilities owned by IB Nitrogen, a subsidiary of a Canadian fertilizer company.\n\nThe Celanese amine products are:\n     Isopropylamine\n     Dipropylamine\n     Cyclohexylamine\n     Ethylamine\n     Diamylamine\nThese products are used by other chemical companies to make herbicides, insecticides, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe IB Nitrogen product is:\n     Isobutylidene diurea\nThis product is a slow-release specialty fertilizer used on golf courses and turf farms.  It is also used in plant nurseries for growing ornamentals such as azaleas and poinsettias.\n\nThe EPA's Risk Management Plan provides an excellent vehicle for continued dialogue with the people that live and work around the Celanese Bucks site.  The Celanese Bucks Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in our operations.  The LeMoyne Community Advisory Panel and the LeMoyne Industrial Park companies are recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding cooperation.  This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\n\nPlant Organization:\n\nThe plant has a site director (plant manager) who oversees all plant activities.

All plant operators are included in a rotation to conduct a safety meetings.  Safety meetings include training on regulatory requirements and plant specific issues.  Testing is conducted in safety meetings to insure the information is understood.\n\nPlant operators are trained as part of the BEST team (the Bucks Emergency Services Team).  They learn the specifics of emergency response command, emergency response techniques, and conduct drills.\n\nWhat is RMP?\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established regulations that require Celanese and many other companies to file a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Celanese Bucks Plant has 5 chemicals on a list of 140 chemicals developed by the EPA.  All companies that use, make or store a minimum quantity of these chemicals must meet these regulations.\n\nCelanese complies with RMP and OSHA 1910.119, (the OSHA Process Safety Regulation) through our Process Safety Management Program.  The Bucks plant manages all plant processes per our Process Safety Management program.  The program meets all of the RMP and OSHA requirements such as:\n*  Develop and implement a risk management system.\n*  Conduct hazard assessments of all processes.\n*  Implement accident prevention requirements.\n*  Develop an emergency response program that is coordinated with\n    local agencies.\n*  Track and analyze incidents to prevent reoccurrence.\n\nThe RMP regulation has an additional requirement to develop worst case and alternate case scenarios and make them available to the public.

The EPA has provided a procedure for calculating the quantity of chemical that could be released and the distance it could travel for a Worst Case Scenario:\n  1. Assume that your largest tank of listed chemical breaks open and spills all of its contents in 10 minutes.\n  2. Determine the maximum distance where there is concern for the public being exposed, based on the EPA supplied exposure data.\n\nCelanese Bucks:\nListed Chemical      Maximum Distance\nAmmonia                   3.6 miles\nPropionitrile               9.9 miles\nCyclohexylamine       0.9 miles\nEthylamine                 0.5 miles\nIsopropylamine          1.1 miles\n\nAlternate Release Scenario:\nThe Worst Case Scenarios are meant to represent the worst possible incident. Additionally, RMP requires each site to determine a less severe scenario that could potentially impact the public.  These are called the Alternate Release Scenarios.  The EPA provides guidance on how determine the impact of an Alternate Release Scenario also, but the size of the release is set by the site.

The release occurred when the worker opened a valve before he had properly prepared the system.\n\nHow We Keep Our Plant Safe:\n\nPeople: Our Most Valuable Safety Resource\n1. All plant operators are trained and certified in the jobs they do.\n2. All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n3. A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical processing, safety, and regulatory issues.\n \nEquipment: Maintained in Safe Condition\n1. All plant process equipment is subjected to mechanical integrity inspections to look for corrosion or wear.\n2. Safety devices such as pressure relief valves and shutdown systems are inspected and tested on a regular basis.\n3. A thermographic camera allows us to check for temperature deviations in equipment, check for electrical faults, and verify levels.\n4. Glass level gauges have been replaced with metal, magnetically-coupled gauges.\n\nSafety Systems: Protective Safety Net\n1. All storage tanks and process vessels are protected against over-pressure by safety relief valves, much like the safety relief valve on your home water heater.\n2. Process safety systems are programmed in our process control computers.  If a designated level, pressure, temperature, or other parameter goes out of range, the process will shut down automatically.\n3. Oxygen detectors protect the integrity of key equipment including various boiler, compressor, and reactor operations.\n4. All plant modifications and procedure changes undergo a management of change process that involves operations, maintenance, engineering, and management review.\n\nPrepared: For Emergency Response\n1.
