The facility also stores numerous smaller \ntransportable tanks (nurse tanks) that are actually used in the fertilizer application process.          \n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per 40 CFR 68.165(a)(2) to\ndetermine program applicability.

The\nworst-case scenario requires a ground-level release height (0 feet).

The alternative release scenario considered is in accordance with the \nguidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.  Alternative release parameters are \npresented below:\n\nAlternative Scenario Parameters                \n           \n    1.   Land Use - Rural                 \n    2.

Release Duration - 10 min\n      \nThe alternative scenario chosen for this facility involves a release because of a\nsudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this scenario is still unlikely because\nthe transfer hoses used have multiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless\nsteel wire underneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it is\nmore likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  This scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor line to the tank\ntruck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture area is assumed at 0.5 square\ninches.  Because personnel are always present at the facility during transfer, Battle Creek \npersonnel will respond within 10 minutes.  Release rate was calculated using \nthe OCAG tank release equation (Section 8.1.1).             \n        \nInput of the preceding data into DAGADIS+ revealed an alternative release scenario impact \nof 0.23 miles for the facility. There are no residences located within 0.23 miles from the facility. \nIn fact, the closest residence is located approximately 0.4 miles away.
