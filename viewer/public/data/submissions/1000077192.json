      "SummaryText": "Facility Description: The North Tonawanda Water Treatment Plant (Plant) is located at 1 Archer Street, City of North Tonawanda, New York. The facility stores and uses chlorine in the treatment process of potable water. The Plant has developed this program in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (CAPP) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAAA), a.k.a., the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule, which is codified at 40 CFR 68; and the United States Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (HHCs) standard (PSM standard), which is codified at 29 CFR 1910.119. The program is designed to inform all Plant employees of the hazards of chlorine, procedures for the safe use of chlorine, and the steps taken for the safety of employees in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency response plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, training, etc.).\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy.  The City will take every reasonable action to prevent all accidental releases. We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training and inspecting processes available.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP).  The City has coordinated with the local Fire Department for response to chlorine emergencies.  Onsite employees are trained to evacuate the site and call the Fire Department if a chlorine leak is detected.  The Fire Department visits the site each year to remain familiar with the chlorine system and its risks.  \n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source.  The stationary source is the gaseous chlorine disinfection system at this municipal water filtration plant. Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is the regulated substance handled at this facility. The system consists of redundant storage, transport and feed equipment. The quantity on site qualifies the chlorine system as a Program 3 process.\n\n\n\nThe Worse-Case Scenari"

      "SummaryText": "o.  The worst case scenario is the rupture of the largest chlorine tank. The volume of the storage tank would allow a maximum of 2,000 pounds of liquid chlorine to be released. In the worst-case scenario, this tank would rupture and spill its entire contents onto the ground in ten minutes. Using the EPA lookup tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles. \n\n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario is the discharge of chlorine from a hole in a pipe. Based on a 1/16 inch opening, such a release could yield a release of 100 pounds of chlorine during a ten-minute release. Using the EPA lookup tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program.  The accidental release prevention program includes a combination of design, training, and inspecting. The chlorine system was designed according to current codes and specifications, and adheres to good operating practice. The operators and contractors who work in and around the chlorine equipment have been trained in both safety and proper operating procedures. We have a detailed monitoring and inspection program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the chlorine equipment.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History.  There were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program (ERP).  The Plant is equipped with an emergency warning system. Alarms are placed throughout the Plant to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of chlorine or other emergencies that may be encountered. The Plant has developed specific procedures to be followed in the event of release. These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so. Plant personnel are on site 24 hours, 7 days per week. Plant employees have coordinated the Plant's emergency response program with the City of North "
