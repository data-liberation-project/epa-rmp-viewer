This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Regency Gas Services (RGS) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nRGS operates the Dubach Gas Plant located in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana.  The Dubach Gas Plant is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant designed for the extraction of liquid (LPG) Y-grade product from a gas stream.  The cryogenic extraction plant recovers methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, isobutane, and isopentane from the inlet gas.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Dubach Plant is a Program 3 process. \n\nThe Dubach Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nIt was determined that a single vessel of flammable mixture (LPG) exceeded threshold quantity. The identification of this exceedance indicates that the Dubach Gas Plant is a covered process with regulated substances subject to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Dubach Gas Plant has not had any accidental releases during the past five ye"

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Dubach Gas Plant.  Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nRGS and the Dubach Gas Plant actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.   This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant. \n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nThe Dubach Gas Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as for key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process"

This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information  provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Dubach Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Dubach Gas Plant primarily uses the HAZOP method to perform these evaluations. This technique provides a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design. Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Dubach Gas Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the acti"

The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Dubach Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process. \n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the Dubach Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations. Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices. Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe Dubach Gas Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  The Dubach Gas Plant provides Hot Work Permit training to all plant employees. Copies of issued work permits are maintained in Operations and Maintenance for a period of 1 year following completion o"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1)  are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job, (2)  have received and understood the training required and carry a training document card while on location, (3) follow the safety rules of the location including the safe work practices, (4) advise the plant of any unique hazards presented by the contractor, and (5) notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in the process areas.  \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Dubach Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specification, that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that training of each employee involved in operating the process or equipment has been completed. A standard checklist is used to document compliance.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Dubach Gas Plant has well-established programs, procedures and practices that are required to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle lightly hazardous chemicals and/or flammable gas or liquid is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of a release. Equipment examples include vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, and relief and vent systems with associated emergency shutdown systems and controls (i.e., monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks).\n\n"
