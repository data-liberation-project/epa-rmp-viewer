In the event of a chlorine accident or release, facility personnel are trained to notify the LEPC, local emergency response, and evacuate the facility.  Trained LEPC staff will evaluate the situation and make further decisions.\n\nThe City of Mount Holly is committed to operating all of its facilities in a safe and environmentally sound manner and compliance with these regulations serves as a testament to the city's commitment."

      "SummaryText": "The City of Mount Holly and the Mount Holly Water Treatment Plant personnel are committed to the safe operation of the water treatment facility.  The facility uses chlorine to disinfect water to provide safe drinking water to the public. Treated water is distributed citywide for use in homes, industry and for fire fighting purposes.\n\nThis facility collects its water from Mountain Island Lake, and is capable of processing up to 6 million gallons of water per day.  On average, businesses and residents of Mount Holly use about 3.0 million gallons of water per day.  The water is treated through an alum flocculation process and disinfected via chlorination.  In the disinfection process, a chlorinator mixes chlorine gas with water to make a chlorine solution.  The treated water is allowed to mix with the chlorine solution in a contact chamber, killing pathogens that are dangerous to humans, animals and aquatic life that remain after flocculation treatment.\n\nChlorine is a regulated toxic chemical by 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore any process utilizing over 2,500 pounds of chlorine must implement Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Mount Holly Water Treatment Plant stores a maximum of four one-ton chlorine cylinders (approximately 8,000 pounds of chlorine) and is therefore subject to RMP requirements.  The storage of chlorine also makes the facility subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nThe worst case, toxic release scenario is a release of gas from a single 2,000 pound cylinder in ten minutes.  The alternative toxic release scenario is a slower release approximated as a one square inch hole 12 inches below the liquid level of the a cylinder.  Again, this would involve a release of 2000 pounds, over a longer period of time.  These releases could affect local populations according to EPA*Comp calculations and Marplot population estimates.\n\nTo prevent toxic releases of chlorine, the facility complies with the OSHA PSM standard.
