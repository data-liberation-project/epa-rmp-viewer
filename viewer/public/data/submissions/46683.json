Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n    In this Kinder Morgan Liquids Terminals, LLC (Kinder Morgan) distribution facility, we handle Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that makes VAM valuable as a commodity also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling VAM to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health, as well as our co-workers and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle VAM combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n    Our emergency response program is based upon the EPA, Coast Guard, DOT, OSHA and LEPC requirements.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n    *    The primary purpose of this facility is to temporarily store, break bulk, and distribute VAM to both retail and wholesale customers.  VAM is used as a raw material for manufacturing polyvinyl resins, such as those used in latex paints, paper coating, adhesives, textile finishing and safety glass inter-layers.  VAM is received by ship, rail car, and truck and stored in six storage tanks throughout the Terminal.  This facility has equipment for unloading ships, barges, rail cars and tank trucks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n    *    The regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is VAM.\n\n3.

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable API and NFPA standards.  All of our affected employees have been thoroughly trained in accordance with 40 CFR 68.\n\n4.    Five-Year accident history:\n\n    There have been no releases of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) in the past five years that have had an adverse impact on the community.\n\n5.    The Emergency Response Program:\n\n    This facility's Emergency Response Program is based upon the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Coast Guard, Department of Transportation, Occupational Safety and health Administration and Local Emergency Planning Commission.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire and police authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  This plan has been submitted to and approved by the respective regulatory agencies and is reviewed on an annual basis.  The facility is subject to regular annual inspections by each of the aforementioned governmental agencies.\n\n    Additionally, to ensure that employees are adequately trained and prepared to respond to emergencies, they receive training in Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER), Emergency Action and Fire Prevention, Accidental Release Prevention, Environmental Awareness, and Terminal Safety Systems.  Employees also attend fire school and HAZWOPER refresher training annually.\n\n    Finally, the facility prepares for emergencies by conducting quarterly notification drills, semi-annual equipment deployment drills; annual tabletop exercises, and participates in area-wide drills that are conducted by governmental agencies.\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n    This facility was constructed in 1933 and complies with applicable governmental and industry standards.  No changes are planned to upgrade the facility.
