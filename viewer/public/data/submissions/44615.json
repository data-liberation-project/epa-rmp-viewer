Based on the Compliance Guidance and Model Risk \nManagement Program for Water Treatment Plants (WTP Guidance) prepared by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the EPA, the distance from the Facility to the point where the chlorine concentration has diminished to 3 ppm is 3.1 miles. This distance is known as the end-point distance. The area of potential impact is defined as a circle with its center point at the Facility and extending outward to the end-point distance, in this case 2.5 miles. 1999 census data as calculated by the land View TM III program Indicate that approximately 4,700 people live within this area of potential impact. The Claremore Quadrangle U.S.Geological Survey 7.5 Minute Series Topographic map (Claremore Quadrangle map), a Delorme Street Atlas USA@ street map (Delorme map), and the MARPlOT@ map indicate the area at potential impact contains at least one school, residence, hospital, park, jail, and commercial, office, or industrial area. A review of the Claremore Quadrangle, the Delorme map, and the MARPlOT@ map failed to Identify any sensitive environmental receptors with the area of potential impact.   \n A more realistic release scenario known as the alternative-case release scenario was identified in a process hazard analysis (PHA) of the Facility's chlorine system. This release would be much smaller than the worst-case release, and it was estimated that it could be contained within one (1) hour or less by the Claremore Fire Department. This release could occur if an operator failed to properly attach the regulator to the chlorine ton- container's valve, and then opened the valve. This would cause a release of chlorine through the open valve at a maximum sustained rate of 10.7 Lb/min. This would immediately cause a very high concentration of chlorine in the Chlorine Room requiring the operator to immediately evacu"

Other (specify) \n 3.0 OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS - CHLORINE \nFacilities are required to conduct an offsite consequence analysis to provide information to the EPA and the public about the potential consequences of an accidental chemical release. The offsite consequence analysis (OCA) consists of two elements: \n. A worst-case release scenario, and \n. An alternative-case release scenario \n3.1 Worst-Case Release Scenario - Chlorine EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in 40 CFR 68.22(a). In general, the distance to the endpoint is the distance a chlorine vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposure will no longer occur. The EPA defines the end-point for ' . chlorine to be the point where the chlorine has dissipated in the air to a concentration of 3 parts per million by volume (3 ppmv). \nTo perform the offsite consequence analysis for chlorine the Risk Management Program Guidance for Water Treatment Plants (WTP Guidance) prepared by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the EPA was used. 40 CFR 68 specifies several conservative assumptions that were used to develop the worst-case release scenario end- point distances contained in the WTP Guidance. These assumptions include release duration, release height, wind speed, atmospheric stability, ambient air temperature, and relative humidity. \nThe release quantity for worst-case scenarios for toxic substances is the maximum contents of the largest storage vessel taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity. The release height is assumed to be at ground level.\n\n Ground-level releases are unlikely. Wind speed is set at 1.5 meter"

Temperature and relative humidity are assumed to be 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0 F) and 50% respectively. The surrounding topography can be classified either as rural or urban. The Facility's surrounding topography is classified as rural due to the lack of surrounding obstructions (i.e. industries, office buildings, etc.) \nThe maximum amount of chlorine held at the Facility is 10,000 Ib; however, the largest amount of chlorine held in a single vessel is 2,000 pounds. Chlorine is a gas at ambient temperature, but is a liquid under pressure in the ton-container. The worst-case release scenario for gases that are liquified by pressure specifies a gaseous release rather than a liquid release. The Facility's worst-case release scenario identified during the process hazard analysis assumes a ton-container ruptures during the offioading procedure from a \n(;J) delivery truck. This scenario assumes the ton-container is outside of the Chlorine Room and the release occurs over a period of 10 minutes. The worst-case release rate is calculated: \nRelease Rate, Ib/min = Quantity Released, Ib / Release Duration \nIn this case the quantity released would be the entire contents of the ton-container (2,000 Ibs) and the release duration rate is set at 10 minutes. Therefore: \nRelease Rate, Ib/min = 2,000 Ib/ 10 min = 200 Ib/min \nThe distance to the endpoint of the worst-case release is taken from Table 5-1 in the WTP Guidance. The WTP Guidance document shows an endpoint of 2.5 miles for a rural facility with a chlorine release rate of 200 Ib/min.

Blue Starr in Claremore, Oklahoma. The Facility treats water drawn from Claremore Lake to drinking water standards for residential and industrial use. The Facility uses one (1) regulated substance (chlorine) above the threshold quantity of the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68). Facilities that use or store any toxic or flammable substances listed in 40 CFR 68.130 above the specified threshold quantities in a process, are required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program enforced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \nThe goal of this Risk Management Program is to prevent an accidental release of chlorine that could potentially cause harm to the public and/or the environment, and to mitigate the severity of any release that does occur. The Risk Management Program includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program. \nThe Facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \nIn the event of an emergency involving the chlorine system, the Facility's emergency action plan requires an immediate evacuation of the Facility and immediate notification of the Claremore Fire Department. The Claremore Fire Department will be responsible for responding to the emergency and directing any required public evacuation or sheltering in place. The Facility has discussed this Emergency Response Plan with the Claremore Fire Department and members of the Claremore Fire Department have inspected the facility. The Claremore Fire Department has the necessary equipment required to seal a leak in a chlorine con-container. They are also equipped with"

The Facility has also implemented maintenance and inspection procedures to ensure the mechanical integrity of the chlorine system's equipment. Prior to implementing any change to the chlorine system, a management of change procedure will be adhered to including a pre-startup review of the chlorine system.
