      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary (40 CFR 68.155)\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground Data\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) promulgated by the Federal Environmental Administration (EPA), TRANSFLO Terminal Services, Inc. has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations involving Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate  at their North Haven, CT facility.  The TTSI terminal provides transloading services of bulk products between rail and truck transportation modes.  The North Haven TRANSFLO terminal has been in operation since 1990.  The terminal is located at 110 Universal Drive, North Haven, CT.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\n\r\nTRANSFLO is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, contract operators, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is TRANSFLO policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe TRANSFLO North Haven operations involve two covered process which are separate and unique from one another.  Both process involve the transfer of bulk chemical products from a rail car to a highway cargo container but each uses specialized non-inter changible equipment. \r\n\r\nEach process is for transloading product from railroad tank cars into highway cargo trailers in quantities in excess of 8,000 gallons per cargo trailer which will exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario\r\n\r\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, TRANSFLO has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for LPG products using the parameters specified by the EPA.  TRANSFLO's worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a single railroad tank car with subsequent product release over a 10-minute period.  In developing the release parameters of the worst-case scenario, TRANSFLO has not considered any passive mitigation measures.  Using the EPA's RMP*Comp software program, it was dete"

The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is considered to have an extremely low probability of occurrence.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nTRANSFLO also evaluated several other release scenarios considered to have a higher level probability of occurrence (although a very low probability) based upon a review of over 10 years of incident data from chemical transloading operations.  This 10 year period included the safe handling of over 500,000 rail to truck chemical transloads.  After a careful review of both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, TRANSFLO has decided to include one alternative release scenario into the RMP document.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario identified by TRANSFLO is the failure of a product transfer hose.  In developing the parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, TRANSFLO considered the average response time of terminal personnel to control the release and safely shut the transfer unit down.   Using the EPA RMP*Comp software program and EPA's RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the flammable endpoint in the alternative release scenario has the potential to result in minor site consequences at a distance much less than the worst-case scenario and would largely be limited to terminal property itself.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of covered process chemicals, TRANSFLO has implemented several precautionary measures:\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tTRANSFLO has developed standard operating procedures (SOP'S) for the Transloading of these products from railcar to highway cargo tank for use by trained and qualified personnel.\r\nA\u00bf\tTRANSFLO encourages contract operator employees to voice concerns, offer suggestions and contribute to procedures, policies and processes involving this product.

A review of the National Fire Code finds this operation is in compliance with all requirements of the code.\r\n\r\nThe TDI transfer unit was designed and constructed following recognized industry best practices and based upon sound and proven engineering practices. \r\n\r\nTRANSFLO annually offers facility familiarization sessions with the local emergency responders as part of the terminals emergency action plan (EAP).
