      "SummaryText": "Union Gas Operating Company (Union) owns and operates the Doornbos Estates #1 Production Facility.  The Doornbos Estates #1 Production Facility receives production from area oil and gas wells via flowline. The production is treated to separate gas, water and condensate. The gas is further processed through a cryogenic process involving the rapid temperature and pressure change via a Joule-Thompson (JT) valve which condenses the lighter hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane, to condense forming a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) product. The NGL product is stored in a pressurized bullet tank with a volume of 18,000 gallons and operating pressure of ~150 psi.\n\nA total rupture of the 18,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Doornbos Estates #1 Production Facility. The 18,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles. No public receptors are within a 0.3 mile radius of the NGL tank. The worst-case scenario would not affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 level RMP under 40 CFR 68. The Doornbos Estates #1 Production Facility is located in a remote area and is not normally occupied.\n\nThe facility has no accident history to report. Should an emergency involving the Doornbos Estates #1  Production Facility\u00c2\u00bfs NGL system occur, it is Union\u00c2\u00bfs policy to notify the Beauregard Parish Fire District #2 and request that they respond to the emergency. This policy has been discussed with the fire department."
