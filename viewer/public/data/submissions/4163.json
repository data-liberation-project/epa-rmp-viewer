The emergency response plans are tailored to each facility owned and operated by the Borough of Huntingdon. The Borough employs the latest technology in process controls and monitoring detection systems. Active and passive mitigation systems are designed to minimize the impacts of any accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Huntingdon Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), owned and operated by the Borough of Huntingdon, provides sewer service to residential, commercial and industrial users in the Borough of Huntingdon and in portions of Smithfield and Walker Townships. The Huntingdon WWTP utilizes one (1) chemical onsite which is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention provisions found at 40 CFR Part 68. This toxic substance is Chlorine. Chlorine is used for disinfection of the treated effluent prior to discharge to the Juniata River. \n\nTypically, there are three (3) one-ton containers of Chlorine present onsite at any given time. These containers are located in a brick chemical storage building. The room containing the containers vents to the outside. The chlorination feed system has manual shutoffs. A remote alarm system is employed to notify employees of any releases of chlorine gas. Safety equipment is located nearby. The facility is manned 8 hours per day, seven days per week. Gates to the facility are locked when personnel are not on duty, therefore, the chlorination building is not accessible to the public. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis conducted for the Huntingdon WWTP consisted of two scenarios, worst-case release and alternative release. The parameters for the worst-case release scenario are established by EPA. These parameters as"

      "SummaryText": "sume the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released over a 10-minute period with default wind speed, temperature and humidity conditions. The only passive mitigation present at the Huntingdon WWTP is the fact that the chlorine containers are stored in a building which vents to the outside air. Using EPAs RMP*Comp model, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for a worst-case release is 0.9 miles. The estimated residential population within the 0.9 mile radius of the facility is 622 persons based on 1990 U.S. census data. Other than the residential population, there are a few commercial establishments, a church, a county prison, and a recreational area located within this measured radius.\n\nThe proposed alternative release scenario assumes a release will occur due to equipment failure. The assumed parameters used in the RMP*Comp model are based on an actual incident that occurred in 1997. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for an alternative release is less than 0.1 miles. The estimated residential population within the 0.1 mile radius of the facility is 5 persons based on 1990 U.S. census data. \nAn accidental release of a small quantity of chlorine occurred on October 19, 1997. A vacuum regulator unit was being installed on a full 1-ton container of chlorine. A screw on the yoke assembly of the regulator could not be tightened and chlorine was detected using aqua ammonia solution. Several attempts to tighten the screw resulted in a few short bursts of chlorine gas being released. It is estimated that the duration of the release was less than one minute and that no more than one pound of chlorine was actually released into the room atmosphere. Two employees of the facility were taken to the hospital for observation. No serious injuries, property damage (other than replacement parts) or environmental damage occurred due to the accidental release. As a result of the accident, no changes were made in the emergency response policy for the facility"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nA prevention program policy document was developed for the Huntingdon WWTP in accordance with regulations found at 40 CFR ''68.48-68.60. The facility is classified as a Program 2 facility. Huntingdon WWTPs Program 2 Prevention Program summarizes the pertinent safety information, hazard review procedures, operating procedures, training requirements, maintenance procedures, compliance audits and incident investigation policies. \n\nThe facility has standard operating procedures (SOPs) in effect for operation and maintenance of the chlorination system. These SOPs are readily accessible to the chlorine building. Safety precautions include, checking the chlorine detector before entering the storage room, use of a face mask and other appropriate personal protective equipment, and testing for leaks with ammonia solution. A chlorine emergency kit \"B\" for 1-ton containers is available to contain small leaks and for minor repairs. Appropriate training on the use of the chlorine kit is provided to all employees. Other training plant employees are offered include: confined space entry, first aid and CPR. Documentation of the training events for each employee is maintained in the employees personnel file.\n\nThe Huntingdon WWTP has an Offsite Response Plan which has been coordinated through the Huntingdon County LEPC. The Plan provides notification procedures, emergency response procedures, reporting requirements, and coordination efforts of all involved parties. The plan is reviewed and revised periodically to ensure contact names and telephone numbers are correct."
