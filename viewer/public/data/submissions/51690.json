      "SummaryText": "The disinfection process at the Jayuya Wastewater Treatment Plant, operated by the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) uses chlorine, a toxic and hazardous substance which is regulated by EPA and OSHA.  The use of chlorine for disinfection of treated water is an established practice in engineering and provides a critical aspect to the quality of the water discharged.  Due to the hazards of chlorine, the Jayuya WWTP has established various precautionary safety practices during the storage, handling and use of chlorine, required for the protection of employees, external contractors, visitors and the adjacent areas.  These security measures include procedures, and equipment use to minimize the potential of an accidental discharge along with an action plan in case of emergencies which is aimed at the adequate management of a situation.\n\nPRASA has established emergency response practices and administrative processes to comply with EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan rule 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management rule 29 CFR 1910.119.  The plan, established under Procedure 945also establishes coordination with local emergency response agencies such as the Environmental Quality Board, State Emergency Response Agency, Fire Department and the Police.  The process alerts, as necessary, the communities involved.  \n\nThere are normally two 2000 lbs containers filled with chlorine at the facility, one in stand-by mode and the other in use.  In order to prevent escapes, PRASA has adopted the use an emergency shut off system, mounted on the cylinder valve, which is automatically activated upon detection of a leak.  There have been no accidental releases from the facility in the past five years.\n\nPRASA will conduct trainings to its personnel on a continuous basis for the implementation of the plan and management of toxic substances.  Also, the plan will be revised every 5 years."
