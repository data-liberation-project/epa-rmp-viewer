Out farmer owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  This company is an agricultural retail business which specializes in grain storage for area producers, as well as providing the necessary inputs for grain production.\nOur plant consists of one anhydrous storage tank,  30,000 gallons, and 20 nurse trailers holding approximately 82,000 pounds (4,100 per trailer), and when everything is filled to the 85% capacity, will hold approximately 214,000 pounds.  The worst case scenario may potentially release 132,000 pounds (over a ten minute periods) and has a distance to endpoint of 2.50 miles.  This release has the potential to affect 20 area residents.  \nThe alternative release scenario would have a release of 11,908 pounds over a two minute period.  This release would have a distance to endpoint of .83 miles and would still affect 20 people within the community.  \nThis company maintains and operates their NH3 plant in strict accordance with all federal, state, and local authorities.  The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement.  Our employees are trained in safety procedures, proper plant operation, plant maintenance, and the employees are competency tested over the training material.  Each employee uses goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of safety water during nurse tank loading operations.  \nWith the above mentioned training in mind, it makes it very simple to report to you that absolutely no injury accidents or property damage has occurred at this facility for the past five years.  \nOur Emergency Response Plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public, and the area first responders.  This company provides plant tours for our local fire department and our plant has been"
