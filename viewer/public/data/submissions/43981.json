              "Description": "This process includes three interconnected production units, Aqueous Choline, Choline Salts, and TMAC. All information included in this prevention program applies to all three units with the following exceptions: - The TMAC system is not equipped with a camera monitoring device. - Only Aqueous choline operates with all valves opened. The valves will close automatically due to loss of system pressure under the following conditions; loss of nitrogen supply, rupture of nitrogen tubing due to mechanical failure, a fire at the unloading pump causing the plastic tubing to melt resulting in sealing the vessel, power failure,switch being manually turned, high storage tanktemperature, and high rate of rise in storage tank level. The pumps are not equipped with pressure relief valves, pumps are not equipped with high, high level indicators. Only the tanks are equipped with these safety devices. The Aqueous choline system is equipped with a camera monitoring device as an additional safeguard in detecting any deficiences in the safe operation of the process and to lessen the risk of any accidental releases. The dates of the PHA, which are 06/28/2001, 03/05/2001, and 01/21/2004 are for Aqueous choline, Choline salts, and TMAC respectively.",

Program 3 ( which is OSHA's Process Safety Management Plan) is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, pre-safety startup, contractor safety, emergency planning and response, compliance auditing, and employ participation. The Process Safety Management Program ensures that the processes and the equipment in the processes are designed, constructed, and maintained according to industry codes and standards, and that the processes follow good engineering practices. The mechanical integrity element of the program includes continuous inspections and testing of equipment and monitoring devices in the processes to detect any deficiences and correct them before it contributes to a potential release incident.
