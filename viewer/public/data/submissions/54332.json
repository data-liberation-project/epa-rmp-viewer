Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nAlameda Chemical & Scientific - HTP is committed to the protection of our employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass chemical warehousing, distribution, and repackaging for the chemical industry.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (aqueous), Hydrochloric acid [aqueous Hydrogen chloride] and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [aqueous Hydrofluoric acid].  These 3 substances are not use (manufactured or used in a process), these chemical constituents are warehoused and distributed to end users.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Aqueous Ammonia Storage.  In this scenario 608 lb. of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited "

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.19 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nAn additional worst case release scenario for Program 2 and 3 toxics, involving a catastrophic release from Hydrochloric Acid Storage, is also included in the RMP because Hydrochloric acid is stored above TPQ.  In this scenario 200 lb. of Hydrochloric Acid (conc 37% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 60% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.
