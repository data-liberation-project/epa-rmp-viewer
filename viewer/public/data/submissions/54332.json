This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass chemical warehousing, distribution, and repackaging for the chemical industry.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (aqueous), Hydrochloric acid [aqueous Hydrogen chloride] and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [aqueous Hydrofluoric acid].  These 3 substances are not use (manufactured or used in a process), these chemical constituents are warehoused and distributed to end users.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Aqueous Ammonia Storage.  In this scenario 608 lb. of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.19 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nAn additional worst case release scenario for Program 2 and 3 toxics, involving a catastrophic release from Hydrochloric Acid Storage, is also included in the RMP because Hydrochloric acid is stored above TPQ.  In this scenario 200 lb. of Hydrochloric Acid (conc 37% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 60% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nAlameda Chemical & Scientific - HTP maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of annually and/or when processes and chemicals change. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 06/02/2008.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Alameda Chemical & Scientific - HTP maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining:\n\nAlameda Chemical & Scientific - HTP has a"

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nOakland Fire Services is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Completion of hazardous material incident drills and debriefings to test the capabilities and readiness of our Emergency Response Team (ERT).  In addition,  developing improved coordination between non-ERT members and ERT members during an incident are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.
