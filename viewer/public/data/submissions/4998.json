Since 1958 the plant \nhas been expanded several times to its current design capacity of 14.0 million gallons per day.  The VWRF \nprovides secondary treatment followed by effluent filtration, chlorination/dechlorination and discharge to the Santa \nClara River Estuary.  Effluent wildlife ponds are used for storage of chlorinated effluent prior to discharge.  A \nportion of the effluent is reused for irrigation.\n\nVWRF employs a chlorination system for final effluent disinfection using chlorine gas and a dechlorination facility \nutilizing sulfur dioxide.  The facility is equipped with chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors and chlorine and sulfur \ndioxide scrubber systems.\n\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO EPAS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe VWRF uses the following chemicals that are stored in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental \nRelease Prevention Program:\n\nChlorine  One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are imported to the facility by truck from a local supplier.  A \nmaximum of 30 one-ton chlorine cylinders are stored onsite in a building equipped with an emergency scrubber.\n\nSulfur Dioxide  One-ton cylinders of liquid sulfur dioxide are imported to the facility by truck from a local \nsupplier.  A maximum of 4 one-ton cylinders are stored onsite in a building equipped with an emergency scrubber.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\nThe VWRF facility has not had any releases during the past 5 years that resulted in any injuries, off-site \nevacuations, or property damage.\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe VWRF facility is subject to OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for a"

The City has developed a PSM safety program \nto minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The PSM safety program includes the following elements:\n\n? Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems to ensure they \nare properly designed and installed.\n  \n? Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures.  All \nprocedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n \n? Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n \n? Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same level of safety training that the City provides for its \nown employees.\n \n? Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, with stringent documentation of all \ninspections.\n \n? Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n \n? Rigorous safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n \n? Stringent investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine or sulfur dioxide \nreleases.\n \n? Development of a plant-specific emergency action plan.\n \n? Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM \nprogram, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\n \n? Independent audits of the entire PSM program and RMP program every three years.\n \n \n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\n \n City staff utilizes its Emergency Action Plan to provide step-by-step procedures for emergency response in the \nunlikely event of an accidental release.

Re-plumb the vent from the pressure safety relief valve on the sulfur dioxide system so it vents directly into the \nemergency scrubber.\n \n? Update written operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems to include PSM-required \ninformation.\n \n? Upgrade signage and labeling on components within the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\n \n?

Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for the RMP chemicals at the \nfacility are 3 parts per million (ppm) of chlorine and 3 ppm of sulfur dioxide.   In accordance with EPAs rule, the \nfollowing hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario for Chlorine  \n\nLiquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature) is imported to the \nsite by truck and stored in one-ton containers for use in the disinfection process.  The Administrative Worst-Case \nRelease Scenario assumes that the entire contents of one of the chlorine cylinders (2000 pounds of chlorine) is \nemitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of exceptionally calm winds and stagnant atmospheric \nconditions (1.5 meter/second wind speed and F stability) which would result in minimal dispersion of the gas \ncloud as it blew downwind.  The thermodynamic properties of anhydrous chlorine indicate that such a large \ninstantaneous gas release is probably impossible.  If the entire 2000 lbs of liquid chlorine were somehow \ndischarged from the container, it would spill on to the ground and immediately cool itself until it formed a puddle \nof chlorine ice, which would take much longer than 10 minutes to evaporate into a gas cloud.   Nevertheless, the \nRMP rule dictates that the Worst-Case Scenario assumes the release of 2000 lbs of gaseous chlorine. \n\nGraphs from EPAs RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants were used to calculate the downwind \nimpacts.
