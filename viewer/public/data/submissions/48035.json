As part of this\r\ncommitment, KMTEX has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of this\r\nsystem is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at KMTEX and that complies with the requirements of \r\nthe Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements; Risk\r\nManagement Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan)\r\ndescribing the risk management program at KMTEX. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP\r\nrule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at KMTEX. \r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nKMTEX is committed to the safety of KMTEX workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the\r\nprevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. KMTEX implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\r\nreleases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained Emergency Response personnel\r\nwill respond to control and contain such releases. KMTEX evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and \r\ncontacts the local fire department to control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the\r\nrelease. \r\n\r\n1.2 KMTEX and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nKMTEX may at times handle sufficient quantities of substances to be covered by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nSubstances that may be covered under this rule include:\r\n\r\n* vinyl acetate\r\n* allyl alcohol\r\n\r\nThe process for which vinyl acetate may be involved includes:\r\n\r\n* An vinyl acetate distillation to remove impurities.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the potential use of regulated substances"

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and \r\nalternative release scenarios (ARSs). KMTEX does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents \r\na release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like KMTEX. These scenarios are available to KMTEX employees and\r\nthe public. If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP coordinator at (409) 985-4200.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public\r\nbecause of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.\r\nAt distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects should be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint\r\ndistance, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\n* When considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would not experience any long-term \r\nhealth consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g. strong eye, skin or throat irritation, shortness of breath,\r\nand dizziness) are likely. Some people who are particularly susc"

Administrative controls limit the quantity of \r\nvinyl acetate in the tank to 420,000 gal.

After operators demonstrate (e.g. through test, skill \r\ndemonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are deemed a \r\n\"qualified\" operator and can work independently.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nKMTEX uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased"
