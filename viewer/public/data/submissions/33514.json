              "Description": "GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS  The following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Valero Refining Company - Texas, Corpus Christi refinery.  Because refinery processes regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each PSM element and briefly describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.                                       The following brief description of the accidental release prevention program applies to all process units included in this RMP submission and is included only in this section.                                                          Employee Participation:  Valero encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Employee participation is attained by direct employee involvement in reviewing and updating technical documents and chemical information to partipating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all process safety information included in Valero's accident prevention program.  Employee participation in the accident prevention program is documented in an employee participation plan maintained at the refinery.                                                        Process Safety Information:  Valero maintains technical documents used to maintain safe operation of the refinery.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, control settings for process parameters and chemical inventories, and equipment design information.  Responsibility for maintaining process safety information is assigned to departments within the refinery.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.  Valero also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.                               Process Hazard Analysis:  Valero has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systemtatically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  Valero primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implemention of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team fidnings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Valero periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.                  Operating Procedures:  Valero maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  In most cases, Valero operating manuals were developed by lead production workers and their supervisors.  Copies of the manuals are located in the appropriate control areas.                                                           Training:  To complement the written procedures for process operations, Valero trains all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator works only under the direct supervision of a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge and skills to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.                                                                             Contractors:  Valero uses contractors to supplement its workforce, especially during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules, and inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Valero evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.                                                          Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs):  Valero conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.                           Mechanical Integrity:  Valero has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basis aspects of this program include:  conducting training, developing written procedures, performing inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  Maintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a Management of Change (MOV) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Valero ensures new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.                                                                            Safe Work Practices:  Valero has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:  control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.    Management of Change:  Valero has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.                            Incident Investigation:  Valero promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.    Compliance Audits:  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Valero periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Valero personnel, including an employee knowledgeable in the process, participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.",
