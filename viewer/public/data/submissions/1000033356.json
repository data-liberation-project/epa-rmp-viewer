The treated water is disinfected with chlorine and effective Oct.1 2007 Sulfur Dioxide is used as a dechlorinating agent. Chlorine & Sulfur dioxide is the hazardous chemical on the facilities grounds. We store and use approximately 5 one-ton cylinder of chlorine.We store and use 4 one ton cylinders of Sulfur Dioxide.\r\nThe worst-case scenario was the release of all 5 of the one-ton cylinders. The area affected was 2.8 miles in radius. This would affect shopping malls,hospital, schools, homes, creeks, river, and a lake.  The alternative scenario was the release of 1 one-ton cylinder. This release would only effect the population in a 0.8-mile radius. This release would affect a creek, a river, and homes. Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide gas monitors are in place to monitor for leaks. At this facility the alternative release would be a worst-case scenario. This is why we chose this release for our alternative. \r\nThe Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment facility complies with all OSHA PSM rules.
