      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nWise Alloys LLC owns and operates an aluminum processing facility in Sheffield, Alabama. This facility is known as the Sheffield Plant and is located at 501 West 20th Avenue. The aluminum processing facility consists of a plant which manufactures bare and coated aluminum coil. Reynolds Metals Company operated the facility from the early 1950's until 1999. It was purchased by Wise Alloys LLC in April 1999. This facility has processes include aluminum coil coating, slitting, leveling, packing, shipping and storage. The facility employs 107 full-time employees.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices at the Stationary Source (68.155(a))\n\nWise Alloys LLC is committed to operating the Sheffield Plant in a manner that is safe for workers, the public and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices. As part of this commitment, the Sheffield Plant has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes of this facility which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risk at the Sheffield Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and OSHA 1910.119. The document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Sheffield Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the Sheffield Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n7 A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated subst"

In fact, the Sheffield Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nWise Alloys LLC's policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Sheffield Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Sheffield Plant, Wise Alloys reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects. This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nWise Alloys strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. Wise Alloys implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Sheffield Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of equipment. Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approv"

In addition, Wise Alloys requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. The Sheffield Plant Mechanical Integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nThe Sheffield Plant's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release: In the event of an accidental release, the Sheffield Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment. Wise Alloys utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. Wise Alloys trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, Wise Alloys works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur. Wise Alloys has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Colbert County Community Awareness and Emergency Plan (CAER).\n\nThe Sheffield Plant emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, and EPA regulations. This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Sheffield Plant. If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities. The Colbert County Community Awareness and Emergency Plan (CAER) is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency.\n\nWise Alloys is an active participant in the community: Wise Alloys is an active participant in plant and community programs which promote education, safety and environmental awareness.

Wise Alloys established a management system headed by the Environmental Services Department and the Safety Departments to oversee safety and environmental-related activities.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (68.155(b) ):\n\nThe Sheffield Plant handles several regulated substances that are covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program 3 processes at the plant.\n\nRegulated Substance-Sulfur Dioxide, At Coil Coaters\nProcess Quantity 6,000 lb., RMP Threshold-5,000 lb.\n\nRegulated Substance-Flammable Liquids, Coatings/Solvents Tanks\nProcess Quantity 216,000 lb., RMP Threshold-10,000 lb.\n\nSulfur dioxide is used at the coating lines' wastewater treatment facility to adjust pH as part of the wastewater treatment system. One-ton containers are utilized at this wastewater treatment facility.\n\nCoatings and solvents (for use at the coating lines) are stored in the plant yard in aboveground storage tanks.\n\n3.

The EPA recommended Landview program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within the circle of any release scenarios. USGS maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within any release circle.\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by the Sheffield Plant:\n\n3.1 Toxic Substances - Sulfur Dioxide\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for sulfur dioxide is a failure of  1 one-ton sulfur dioxide containers to the sulfur dioxide feeder pipe at the wastewater treatment room at the coating lines which would release 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide in a 10-minute period as mandated by EPA. The worst-case release scenario was evaluated using RMP*COMP\u0019. Under the EPA default worst weather conditions, the chlorine gas cloud would travel a distance of  0.9 miles before the concentration of sulfur dioxide was reduced to below 3ppm (which is the 'endpoint' Emergency Response Planning Guideline value established in the RMP rule). The U.S. Census indicates that 2,820 people live within this distance from the wastewater treatment room; several public receptors are also located within this distance. No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\nThe \"alternative-release scenario\" for sulfur dioxide is the failure of connections from two 1-ton containers to the sulfur dioxide feed header pipe at the wastewater treatment room associated with the High Speed Cleaning and Coating Line. This would result in a release of 2,000 lbs of sulfur dioxide in a 10-minute period. The RMP*COMP\u0019, was used for alternative release scenarios to determine the off-site consequences.

The U.S. Census indicates that 108  people live within this distance from the coatings tank spot; several public receptors are also located within this distance. No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\nThe \"alternate release scenario\" for flammable substances is the spillage of a single tote tank of coating near the coating line which would release 3,400 lbs of  coatings/solvents.
