The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to the refrigerant in a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP regulation defines accident as the following: \r\n\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: \r\n\r\n--  On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\r\n--  Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia over the past five years (May 2017 - May 2022) that meet the EPA reporting criteria for the Five-Year Accident History as specified above.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nContinued safety improvement for the ammonia refrigeration system is a top priority for Danone North America - SLC.

Compliance Audits are also conducted every 3 years that can identify potential compliance issues and recommend actions to achieve full compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an ammonia release, the emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC) and the local Salt Lake City Fire Department.  The ultimate goal for Danone North America's PSM/RMP plan is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, injuries / illnesses, and to avoid physical damage to the environment.  These programs enable our facility to operate a refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern our network of ammonia refrigeration facilities, as well as the broader ammonia refrigeration industry.\r\n\r\nThe Danone North America - SLC ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  The Danone North America - SLC facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the recognized industry codes and standards, which specifically outline requirements for the design and operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  Safety features include ammonia leak detectors in the machinery room, continuous automated ventilation, microprocessor controlled compressors with automatic safety cutouts, ASME certified pressure vessels, and emergency stop controls.

The machinery room houses the compressors, high pressure receiver vessel, recirculator package with pumps, and auxiliary components, while the condensers are located on the roof along with evaporator valve groups and associated piping.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used as the primary refrigerant, which means it is used as a vehicle to move heat from cold storage zones, and secondary coolants (glycol) to the outside atmosphere.  When heat is absorbed by the liquid ammonia, it vaporizes (changes phase), and is then compressed by the compressors.  The resulting high pressure ammonia vapor is routed to the condensers, where fans and sprayed water are used to reject latent heat in the ammonia vapor, causing it to condense to a liquid.\r\n\r\nMultiple surge drums / recirculator packages are utilized to service the various refrigerated zones at the facility that include palletizing, secondary packaging, bottle storage cooler, as well as chilling glycol via three (3) heat exchangers.\r\n\r\nMultiple auxiliary systems are in place to support the operational and safety requirements of the ammonia system including:  ammonia leak detection, auto purger to remove non-condensible gasses, pressure relief system, and refrigeration control system.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration, policies and programs have been developed to limit the risks of an accidental ammonia release and/or minimize the consequences of a significant release, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\r\n\r\nPrograms developed for the PSM/RMP programs include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analy"

All ammonia process equipment, piping, and valves are inspected and maintained on a regular schedule in accordance with manufacturer and industry recommendations.\r\n\r\nFor example, all compressors are routinely inspected for oil leaks, pressure and temperature gauge calibrations, vibration analysis, oil pressure, and amp reading for motors;  alignment of compressor motors and bearings, filter changes, vibration readings are performed every 6 months on compressor motors;  the condensers are inspected weekly (this includes checking and cleaning nozzles and strainers), motors are greased, fans are checked for cracks, and piping is inspected for leaks;  low and intermediate pressure receiver oil pots are drained, pump bearing wear is monitored;  visual inspection for equipment and vessel operating limit conditions, piping and valves are assessed for leaks, integrity, and other potential abnormalities on daily basis;  pressure relief valves are replaced on a five year frequency.
