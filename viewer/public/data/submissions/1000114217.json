The facility covers approximately 100 acres and includes two main production buildings, a research facility, a warehouse and maintenance shop, as well as offices for quality, engineering, and other staff in centrally located buildings and a trailer.\n\nHalocarbon has divided the main production building into three processing areas.  Area 1 and 2 are on the north side and are for processing flammable materials.  Areas 1 and 2 are separated by fire doors and a fire wall.  Area 3 is located on the south side of the building and is used to process non-flammables.  Area 3 is separated from Areas 1 and 2 by the mechanical equipment area and the centrally located control room. The other primary production building is referred to as the Semi-Works Plant (SWP) and is another area used for processing flammable materials. Scale-up operations are conducted in the pilot plant.\n\nHalocarbon Products Corporation manufactures fluorinated specialty chemicals including lubricants used for oxygen and aggressive chemical service, flotation fluids used in gyroscopes, acids for agricultural chemicals, alcohols used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and the generic inhalation anesthetics sevoflurane and isoflurane, photolithographic materials for semiconductor miniaturization, and to electrolyte additives within lithium ion batteries.\n\nThree-(3) chemicals present at Halocarbon Products Corporation fall under the risk management plan: hydrogen fluoride, chlorine, and trifluorochloroethylene. \n\nHydrogen Fluoride is stored in one of two-(2) 8,000 gal tanks in the tank farm. There are leak detectors located at the HF storage area to alert the control room of a release.  A water curtain around the storage tanks and the HF unloading area can be used to suppress HF leaks.  In addition, there is an emergency dump tank designed to hold the"

In the event of a failure of the storage tank, the contents will be dumped to the emergency tank and the water curtain will be started to reduce the amount of HF released from the site. Both HF storage tanks and emergency tank are diked.\n\nChlorine is stored in industry standard ton cylinders.  If a leak were to develop in a cylinder, the cylinder kits (both A and B kits developed by the Chlorine Institute) would be used. Both kits are maintained and stored at the North Augusta facility. These kits consist of various tools, plugs and gaskets necessary to stop cylinder leaks. Two emergency ton cylinders are always available and are capable of holding the contents of a single cylinder.  Area alarms and monitors specific for chlorine are in place to indicate a leak and initiate a response.\n\nThe Trichlorofluoroethylene is stored in a 6400 gal tank located in the tank farm. The area including and surrounding the tank is electrically classified area prohibiting open flame or spark producing work within 35 feet of the dike wall without a hot work permit.  There are flammability leak detectors located around the tank and dike to alert personnel to a release. Loading of the tank is overseen by one of our operators who can perform emergency shutoff of the loading operation.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nHalocarbon Products Corporation falls under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard as well as EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) guidelines. Halocarbon\u0092s policy requires that all changes including the addition of a new commercial process or modifications to an existing commercial process must follow the Management of Change (MOC) process as outlined by 1910.119(l) and 40 CFR 68.75. The MOC process ensures all other aspects of RMP and PSM compliance are addressed prior to operating with the change.

For any Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR), the required participants must include representatives from production, maintenance, and safety along with the MOC owner. \n\nTo minimize the possibility of spilled chemicals getting into the environment, all process areas and truck loading areas are contained.  If there is a spill, the contained material can be reused or properly disposed.\n\nOutside storage tanks are diked.  If a spill occurs, the material collects in the dike.  It is then drained or pumped from the dike to a recovery drum.  There are no automatic pumps in the dikes for rainwater, reducing the possibility of accidentally pumping spilled material to the environment.\n\nHalocarbon uses, stores and ships chemicals in high pressure cylinders.  These cylinders are hydrostatically tested on a regular basis.
