The station is designed to process natural gas, during which liquid products are recovered from natural gas. Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for offsite sales.\n\n\n\nThe Head Coach Plant has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nHowever if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE?\n\n\n\nThe Head Coach Plant is located near Laredo, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nTexas Pipeline's management is committed to the following:\n\n-Preventing accidents;\n\n-Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n-Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n-Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Texas Pipeline operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n-Being a good corporate citizen of Webb County.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the natural gas treatment and liquids recovery process.

These technical documents address the following:\n\n1. Chemical properties and associated hazards\n\n2. Necessary Block Flow Diagrams of the process\n\n3. Maximum intended inventories\n\n4. Upper and Lower limits of process fixed and rotating equipment\n\n5. Equipment design basis and configuration information\n\n6. Identification of all necessary Regulatory equipment design documents\n\n7. Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in material safety data sheet (MSDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators' procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with proc"

This program systematically examines for potential hazards and puts controls in place to manage hazards. Process Hazard Analysis is conducted with a team of Texas Pipeline employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies, evaluates and makes recommendations to management of potential hazards identified. The team's findings are forward to Texas Pipeline's Management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nTexas Pipeline maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nTexas Pipeline has established practices and procedures for the safe operation of fixed, rotating and emergency shutdown equipment.
