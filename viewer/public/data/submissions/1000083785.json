The Hattiesburg Water & Sewer Department accidental release prevention policy involves operational procedures, management practices and continued training to prevent accidental releases. Continued improvement of facilities and procedures will reduce accidental releases. The respose policy involves procedures to notify and coordinate response with local responders.\n\nB. Hattiesburg North Lagoon is one of two wastewater treatment facilities serving the City of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Chlorine gas is used to disinfect the wastewater at this location after it has been treated. Sulfur Dioxide is used to remove the chlorine residual. This facility is located in the northeastern section of the city at 3401 Lakeview Road. The maximum amount of Chlorine at this facility would be six one-ton cylinders. The maximum amount of Sulfur Dioxide would be five one-ton cylinders. This facility is checked seven days a week.\n\nC. The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two Chlorine and two Sulfur Dioxide release scenarios, identified as 'worst case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario.\" Both scenarios were calculated using EPAs RMP* Comp software.\n\n\n\nFor Chlorine, the worst case scenario involves failure of a one-ton cylinder with a 10 minute release and a release rate of 110 pounds per minute. This scenario involves a release in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air.\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves a tubing failure, bad connection or valve failure resulting in a release duration of 60 minutes.\n\n\n\nFor Sulfur Dioxide, the worst case scenario involves a failure of a one-ton cylinder with a 10 minute release duration and a release rate of 110 pounds per minute. This scenario involves a release in an enclosed space in direct contact outside air. \n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves a tubing failure, bad connection or valve failure with a release duration of "

Preventive maintenance program. 3.Use of process and safety equipment. 4. Use of effective operating procedures. 5. Reviews of operational procedures, training, hazards and safety information. Chemical specific prevention steps include the availability of self contained breathing apparatus and awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nE. No accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide have occurred at this facility.\n\nF. Our facility is included in a community emergency response plan. Our employees will not respond to an accidental release other than to notify the Hattiesburg Fire Department. Emergency response will be handled by the hattiesburg Fire Department's Harzard incident response team.\n\nG. Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are stored in a building to protect them from direct sunlight and somewhat contain initial leak. Leak detectors are installed to alert operators of an accidental release Internal training as well as training by outside sourses is conducted on a regular basis.\n\n"
