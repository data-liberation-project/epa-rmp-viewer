      "SummaryText": "Indianapolis Distribution Center\n\n\nA Risk Management Plan has been implemented at the Indianapolis facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The facility is located at 7452 Templehof in Indianapolis, (Marion County) Indiana. The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products, packaged in aerosol cans, manufactured by S.C. Johnson & Son. S. C. Johnson is a privately held, family-managed company, with worldwide headquarters located in Racine, Wisconsin\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in the aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations.  Specifically, the propellants consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends. The maximum projected quantities (cases) of aerosol products stored in the warehouse and the product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage process. \n\nThe worst case scenario performed, based on  EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint will not extend beyond plant property. No offsite receptors are impacted. There have also been no prior accidents at the facility resulting in any offsite environmental impacts.\n\nEmergency response activities at the Indianapolis Facility are coordinated with the Marion County LEPC and the Decatur Township Fire Department."
