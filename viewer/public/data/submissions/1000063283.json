In 2004, a flammable mixture was used to describe the entire process.  In 2009, the mixture was divided into several chemicals that more accurately describe the process, along with the storage vessels and capacities.  Worst case scenarios and alternative case scenarios have also been updated based on more conservative system integration and equipment volumes. The 2020 has added the Marine Traffic unit as a contiguous process. \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant, located in Point Comfort, Texas, operates a two step process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids and condensate) from natural gas.  The Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant has several regulated flammables as part of the natural gas liquids, they are methane, ethane, propane, butane +.  The plant does not contain any toxic materials above the threshold quantities requiring a RMP submittal.\r\n \r\n\r\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents (operating procedures) and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the integrated contingency program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the ICP are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each  element.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Plant personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A PSM management document summarizing the reference documents and their location is being developed and will be readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are handled by local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the P"

      "SummaryText": "- Point Comfort plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees will receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator will be paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through skill demonstrations) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators will periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is scheduled to be conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n \r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has practices to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant uses the purchasing group at Formosa Plastics to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or employees will use the management of change system to review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant has procedures and practices, applicable to the level of risk, that incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  At present quality assurance is maintained by only using original equipment specifications to order replacement parts, using the original equipment manufacturers to do specialized maintenance and or using certified shops to conduct repair work to national codes.  This helps ensure that new or repaired equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:  (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and other), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintena"
