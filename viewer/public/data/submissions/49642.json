It is the policy of CFC to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\tCFC refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.\n\nAt CFC anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\u00bf\tPrevent unnecessary human exposure\n\u00bf\tReduce the threat to our personnel\n\u00bf\tReduce the threat to the community\n\n\nB.\tFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nCFC is a group of fruit processing and cold storage facilities, located near the city of Chelan, county of Chelan, city of Pateros / Brewster and Okanogan, county of Okanogan, state of Washington.\n\nThe regulated substance used at CFC is anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7).\nThe anhydrous ammonia is used a"

The largest interconnected\nsystem could potentially release 12,000 pounds of product.\n\nThere is approximately 23,215 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Brewster\nsystems.  The largest interconnected system could potentially involve Engine Room\n1 and #2, and potentially release 8,570 pounds of product.\n\nThere is approximately 17,655 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Pateros North \nsystem. The larger of the two independent systems ( South Engine Room ) could\npotentially release 10,009 pounds of product.\nThere  is  approximately  2,169 pounds  of  anhydrous ammonia  in the Pateros\nSouth system. The quantities present at this location are well below the 10,000\npound threshold and therefore does not require a RMP.  As such, Worst Case and\nAlternative Scenarios were not calculated.  If in the future this location increases it\u00bfs\ncapacity to the 10,000 threshold an amended RMP will be immediately submitted. \nIn order to provide the Pateros South facility and the surrounding area a higher \nlevel of safety, most components of this RMP and related PSM are applied to the\nPateros South facility.\n\nThere is approximately 23,827 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Okanogan\nsystems. The largest interconnected system could potentially involve Engine Room\n`C\u00bf and `D\u00bf and release 7,640 pounds of product.   \n\nCFC uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, CFC believes in the concept set forth in the \u00bfGeneral Duty Clause\u00bf of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, CFC has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n\nC.

Since ammonia is the only substance on site in excess of the threshold, only one worst-case scenario was performed.  \n\nThe quantity calculated for Chelan was the amount in the largest vessel, as required by 40 CFR 68.25(e), which is the high-pressure receiver.  The dimensions of the receiver are 4.5\u00bf in circumference and 20\u00bf in length, giving the receiver a volume of 318 cubic feet.  The amount of ammonia possible, if the vessel were to be filled to 100% capacity at 85 degrees F is 11,845 pounds. (Based on the weight of liquid ammonia at 85o F, which is 37.25 pounds per cubic foot.)  Since there is connecting piping to the receiver containing liquid ammonia, the actual amount used in modeling the worst-case release was 12,000 pounds.  Also, there are no administrative controls or passive mitigation used in this scenario to mitigate the effects of the release. The distance to the toxic end-point, of 1.8 mile, was obtained by use of RMP-COMP, version 1.06.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis (68.28)\n\nRMP regulations require that at least one alternative scenario be identified and analysis for each regulated substance, at each location.

It contains an electric solenoid valve, which maintains a constant level of liquid refrigerant under a low-side pressure. Vaporized refrigerant moves through the suction (vapor) line to the compressor where it is compressed to a high pressure and discharged into the condenser.  It is cooled by the condenser, returns to a liquid and flows into the liquid receiver.  There is currently, approximately 28,000 pounds of NH3 on the Chelan site, 17,655 pounds on the Pateros North site, 23,215 pounds on the Brewster site and 23,827 pounds on the Okanogan site.
