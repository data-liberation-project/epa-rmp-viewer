      "SummaryText": "PVS Chemical Solutions, Inc., located at 55 Lee Street in Buffalo, New York, is a manufacturer of all grades of sulfuric acid and fuming sulfuric acid (0-30% oleum). In addition to sulfuric acid, PVS manufactures ammonium thiosulfate solution and sodium bisulfite solution.\n\n\n\nThe products manufactured by PVS are basic in nature and are used in a wide variety of applications, including: steel manufacturing, oil refining, photographic processing & development, water & wastewater treatment, agriculture fertilizer, soap & detergent processing, silicon wafer fabrication, pharmaceuticals and many others.\n\n\n\nThe provisions of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act of 1990 (RMP) are applicable to PVS due to the on-site presence of certain chemicals included in Table 1 of Section 68.130 - List of Regulated Toxic Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention. Specifically, anhydrous ammonia can be present on site as a raw material for the manufacture of ammonium thiosulfate solution. Oleum (0 - 30% sulfur trioxide by weight) is present on site as a finished product. Each of these substances can be present on site in amounts greater than the threshold quantities stated in Table 1 referenced above.\n\n\n\nIn concert with an overall commitment to Responsible Care, it is the PVS policy to design, operate and maintain the manufacturing facility in such a manner that minimizes any risks to our employees, the local community and the environment. In brief, our goal is as follows: \"No accidents, injuries or environmental mishaps\".\n\n\n\nThe PVS accidental release prevention policy encompasses the elements identified in OSHA's Process Safety Management program. These elements include Hazard & Operability Studies (HazOps), routine mechanical inspections, management of change procedures and emergency planning, all with participation from hourly employees. HazOps, which review process safety information, operating procedures and emergency actions, have been performed on all "

Operator training is the backbone of the PVS accidental release prevention program with additional emphasis on safe mechanical design and simple yet sound operating procedures. PVS endeavors to minimize risk while a process is still in the design phase of a project. This is done by minimizing raw material inventory or by consuming raw materials directly from the shipping container, thus eliminating transfer risks. All applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations are adhered to.\n\n\n\nEmergency planning at PVS includes a written Facility Response Plan that addresses activities at the facility, emergency procedures, evacuation plans and notification requirements. This plan is shared with the Local Emergency Planning Coordinator, the local fire department and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. For on-site activities, PVS employees are trained in OSHA HAZWOPER techniques.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires a Five Year Accident History. Analysis of incidents that have occurred over the past five years shows that no reportable accident as defined in the RMP rule has occurred. \n\n\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Program Rule, PVS has determined \"Worst Case Scenarios\" by performing off-site consequence analyses which include consideration of release scenarios involving a DOT approved railroad tank car filled with anhydrous ammonia and a process tank filled with 25% oleum. Additional scenarios, described as \"alternative release scenarios\" which are more likely to occur than the worst case, were also analyzed.\n\n\n\nNote, no consequence analysis for flammables was performed because no flammables listed in Table 3 for Section 68.130 - List of Regulated Flammable Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accident Release Prevention are present at PVS. \n\n\n\nIn the \"worst case release scenario\", the theoretical release"

      "SummaryText": " generating the greatest distance to an endpoint is if the entire contents of a 42,000 pound process tank filled with 30% Oleum (CAS 8014- 95-7, Toxic Endpoint 0.010 mg/L) were released instantly. The 30% Oleum is a toxic liquid and the location surrounding PVS is urban. RMP*Comp was used to analyze the consequence of the above release. This release would have off-site consequences. This worst case scenario is described further in the body of the RPM report.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario analysis, which EPA guidance describes as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario\", was conducted on each of the two covered processes. Although this analysis must consider events that are more likely to occur that the worst case scenario, there is still a very low likelihood that any of the events analyzed could take place at PVS given the design of the process and the mitigation systems in place.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenarios are as follows:\n\n- The 1\" hose supplying anhydrous ammonia to the ammonium thiosulfate process fails catastrophically and over 5 minutes releases 9450 pounds of ammonia. Although this analysis is based on manually closing the ammonia valve by operating personnel, an automatic tank car shutoff system would rapidly detect and shutoff the flow of ammonia, thus minimizing the severity of the consequence.\n\n- A 2 square inch hole is formed in the side of the \"Oleum Pump Tank\" which releases 30% oleum and over a 10 minute period and releases 11,500 pounds of Oleum.\n\n\n\nPVS realizes that accidents can have off-site consequences and so designs and operates the facility in a way to minimize the possibility of mishaps. While no immediate process changes are planned as a result of this most recent consequence analysis, our program of constant inspections, audits, training and employee suggestions provide frequent opportunities to improve the safety and reliability of our covered processes.\n\n"
