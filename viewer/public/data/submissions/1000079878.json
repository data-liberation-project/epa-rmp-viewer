The Bristol Site works closely with its Community Advisory Council (CAC) to identify community needs and concerns.\r\n\r\n3.0\tEPA Risk Management Program\r\n\r\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, updated in 2004 and 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under the Clean Air Act containing a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical are subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate a worst case and alternative case scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.\r\n\r\n4.0\tRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Croydon Plant uses two RMP toxic chemicals at threshold quantities: \r\nAcrylonitrile monomer - Storage tank, railcar, and 3 covered reactors\r\nVinyl Acetate monomer - Drum storage only\r\n\r\n**Note - Aqueous ammonia has been removed from coverage as described in previous submissions.   Per EPAs FAQs, water can be subtracted from the aqueous ammonia inventory on site, leaving the site below the ammonia threshold of 20,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n5.0\tThe Rohm and Haas Croydon Plant Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps  \r\n\r\nCroydon Plant maintains a number of accident prevention programs in order to ensure safe operation of all processes.  The Croydon Plant complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, which is nearly identical to EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.

Facility emergency response personnel have radio communications with the Bucks County 911 center.  Emergency response personnel can be self dispatched, or dispatched through the County 911 center.  The facility is also able to access the Community Alerting Network (CAN) through the Bristol Township Emergency Management Department.

Rohm and Haas continuously looks for ways to reduce risks and to improve safety performance.  This includes improvements in control technology, inspections, training, and maintenance of process equipment. Croydon Plant safety program is integrated into all parts of plant operation and involves the identification and implementation of  ways to improve safety performance.   The plant has evaluated its operations against Dow Chemical process safety standards and is changing where necessary to meet these internal standards. \r\n\r\nThe plant has implemented the additional requirements of RMP in the 2017 changes of the RMP regulations.   In 2018 we met with local fire departments and the LEPC to review our RMP chemicals and hazards and to explain the 2017 changes to the RMP regulations.   We have begun evaluation of the other 2017 requirements which are due in 2021."

The following items are part of our ongoing program to prevent releases and incidents for RMP toxic chemicals as well as any other chemicals:  \r\n\r\n5.1\t Employee Participation -  Employees are involved in many activities to continuously improve plant safety.   Employees participate in safety committees, audits, design and pre-startup safety reviews, management of change reviews, process hazard analysis, training, procedure development and monthly safety meetings.   Employees make rounds to identify potential leaks or other safety hazards.   Employees use Dow Chemical electronic tools to communicate hazardous conditions to each other and management.\r\n\r\n5.2\tProcess Hazard Analysis - A process hazard analysis technique known as RC/PHA (Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis) is used to identify and analyze the potential hazards associated with the chemicals and processes we use. And additional technique, Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) is also used to analyze potential hazards.   Corrective action plans are developed and implemented as part of the analysis and updated a minimum of every three years.  Safety systems are designed into the processes.  These are designed to create several layers of protection, so that if one system fails other systems will maintain the process in a safe state.

      "SummaryText": "1.0\tIntroduction\r\nThe Rohm and Haas Company Croydon Plant (Rohm and Haas Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company) is committed to operating and maintaining processes safely.  Our continuing work to prevent accidents and releases from occurring, as well as our preparations to respond to incidents should they occur, help to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This summary provides an overview of the risk management activities at the Croydon Plant, and a discussion of our response to the EPAs Risk Management Program. \r\n\r\n2.0\tGeneral Facility Information\r\n\r\nThe Croydon Plant is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility located in Bristol Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  The plant was built in 1969 and is part of a larger site, the Bristol Site originally built in 1909.  Today, the Bristol Site includes the Croydon plant, the Bristol Polymers solvent based acrylic production plant, and corporate engineering group.  The Croydon Plant shares many of the services provided at the Bristol Site including a unified emergency response network.  Of the total site area of 800 acres, only 250 acres are in actual use with the balance of the area utilized as open space accommodating a variety of plant and animal species.\r\n\r\nThe Croydon Plant produces over 150 different products which are sold to other manufacturers who use them as key components in consumer products.
