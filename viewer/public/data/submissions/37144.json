The emergency action plan developed for the Northport facility applies to the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the waste treatment process.  The intent of the plan is to assist the City of Northport, Alabama in its efforts to preclude or mitigate episodic releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide that could result in the catastrophic loss of personnel and property within the facility and possible the surrounding community.\n      The Wastewater Treatment Plant for the City of Northport, Alabama located at 3950 3rd Street, South, is the primary source of waste treatment for the City of Northport.  In the treatment of wastewater, hazardous chemicals may be employed.  At the Northport facility, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, delivered in 1?ton cylinders, are used as the primary chlorinating/dechlorinating agents.  The chemicals are stored in a building, approximately 100 feet from the main administration and operations building for the facility.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as a commodities also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co?workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the Northport facility?s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\nChlorine has the following general properties:\n1.    Chlorine is a gas at room temperature.\n2"

At any given time, however, the inventory on hand is 4,000 pounds or less of both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  All procedures involving the disinfection system, other than general inspections, involve at least two employees.  Steps are taken to reduce the risk to employees and the local community alike, through the implementation of administrative controls and appropriate regulations.  In the event of a major chlorine or sulfur dioxide release, the operators of the Northport Wastewater Treatment Plant do not respond to stop the release directly.  The facility?s policy is very simple.  In the event of an accidental release, the operator(s) are to:\n1.    Call 911.\n2.    Leave the building immediately.\n\n     According to the appropriate regulations, this allows the Northport Wastewater Treatment Plant to develop an emergency action plan instead of an emergency response plan.  The emergency action and evacuation plan for the Northport Wastewater Treatment Plant was developed in order to meet OSHA requirements under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  The formal emergency evacuation plan is kept in readily available location within the main administration and operations building.  The plan has been discussed and coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the City of Northport Fire Department.

This allows for the determination of the proper type of personal protective equipment deemed necessary and zones for evacuation purposes.\n3.       Leak Testing ? Leaks within the chlorine system are determined using ammonia solution.  Chlorine will react with discharged ammonia vapor to produce a white cloud.\n4.        Emergency ?B? Kit ? This kit contains the required equipment to stop leaks at the valves, fusible plugs and in the wall of the cylinder (one?ton).\n5.        Buddy System ? Activities involving the disinfection system, other than general maintenance, require a minimum of two workers to be present at all times.\n6.       Chemical Handling Schedule ? Chemical cylinders are only manipulated during the day?shift.  This allow for the proper number of persons to be present.  Also, this relieves some of the difficulties that can be involved with the proper entities responding to a release during other times of the day.\n7.        Respiratory Protection Equipment ? Respiratory equipment for the Northport facility consists of two Self?Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) backpack units.  These units are to be used in atmospheres containing concentrations in excess of 5 ppm of chlorine, or 10 ppm of sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical?specific prevention steps:\n\n?
