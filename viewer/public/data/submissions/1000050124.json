Plains management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Ft. Madison Terminal is owned by Plains LPG Services, L.P. and operated by Plains Midstream Canada, L.P.  At the terminal, propane is received via pipeline and stored in pressure tanks.  From these vessels, propane is loaded into tanker trucks for distribution.  Propane is the only flammable substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Ft. Madison Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Ethyl mercaptan is stored at the terminal; however, the amount stored is below threshold quantity.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of the high standards striven for by Plains.  These high standards include:\n\n\n\nA? Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\nA? Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\nA? Operating and maintai"

Correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Ft. Madison Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since Plains purchased the terminal.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this terminal include:\n\n\n\nA? Emergency shutoff valves at each loading hose supplied with cables for remote closure in the event of a hose rupture or piping break.\n\nA? Level, pressure, temperature and relief instrumentation on storage tanks to help prevent overfilling.\n\nA? Hydrocarbon gas detectors located in the area of the truck loading pumps and the truck loading area, the most likely locations of a leak.  The hydrocarbon gas detection system will sound an alarm and trigger the emergency shutdown system.\n\nA? Excess flow valves on the inlet lines and outlet lines for each storage tank to shut-off the tank during large release situations.\n\nA? Solenoid operated valves on each storage tank liquid inlet and outlet line, which can be activated by hitting the emergency shutdown button.\n\nA? Product flow to the two truck loading lanes controlled via an Accuload III system which monitors mercaptan addition, verifies proper grounding, and records the amount of product loaded..\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Ft. Madison Terminal within the last five years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Montrose Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the Ft. Madison Police Department, the Lee County Sheriffs Department, the Lee County LEPC, and as appropriate, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.  The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response.  The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\n\nA? The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\nA? The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\nA? The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the terminal include:\n\n\n\nA? Compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the terminal is periodically being evaluated for improvements.\n\nA? An ongoing dialogue with the Lee County LEPC will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops."
