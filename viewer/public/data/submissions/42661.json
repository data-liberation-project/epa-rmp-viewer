The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  Refining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2, which are on contiguous properties.  BWC also has delayed coking operations in Area 3, which is not adjacent to Areas 1 and 2.  A separate RMP submittal has been prepared for Area 3.\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific \"regulated substances\" that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  \"Regulated substances\" are hazardous chemicals identified by EPA.  BWC  has quantities of various \"regulated substances\" above the threshold amounts.  \n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at BWC\nSection 3: Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\nSection 4: BWC Accidental Release Prevention Program\nSection 5: Five-Year Accidental Release Summary\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSection 1:    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\n\nEquipment at the various units must be designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable internal engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.

In 1986. Under different owners, regular expansion and improvements of facilities have occurred over the years, including the integration of an adjacent refinery in 1986  that doubled gasoline production.  In 1998, the refinery became a part of Equilon Enterprises, LLC, a joint venture of Shell Oil Company and Texaco Inc.  Shell Oil Products US acquired Texaco's interest in 2002.  On March 16, 2005 Big West of California, LLC acquired interest in the refinery.\n\nBWC refines crude oil into a number of consumer products, including gasoline, diesel, gasoils, liquified petroleum gases (LPG), ammonia (for local agricultural use), and coke.\n\nTable 1 lists the covered process units that are subject to the federal Risk Management Program, defines the appropriate RMP program level, and identifies the regulated substances handled in these units.\n\n\nTable 1\nSummary of Covered Process Units - BWC Areas 1 and 2\n\nCrude Vacuum Unit \n(Units 10, 11, and 12) \nPhysically separates crude oil into intermediate and final products by boiling the crude oil and condensing the vapors (i.e., distillation).\nFederal RMP Program Level: Level 3\nRegulated Toxic Substances: None\nRegulated Flammable Substances: Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, Isopentane, Pentane\n\nHydrogen Generation Unit (Unit 20) Manufactures high purity hydrogen for consumption in the hydrotreaters, the hydrocracker, and"

This methodology was used because the RMP rule set forth specific criteria that must be followed for modeling the worst-case scenarios.  The worst case scenarios must incorporate very conservative, simplified assumptions about the nature of the releases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst-case release scenario as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified \"endpoint\".

For a regulated flammable, the worst-case scenario is one where the total quantity of regulated flammable in the largest vessel or pipe is assumed to vaporize and instantaneously result in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nA summary of the worst-case scenarios for BWC Areas 1 and 2 is provided in Table 2.  As required by the RMP rule, the results are shown for one vessel containing a toxic substance (ammonia) and one vessel containing flammables.  These scenarios produced the greatest distance to their respective toxic and flammable endpoints.\n\nTable 2\nWorst-Case Scenario Results - BWC Areas 1 and 2\n\nRegulated Substance: Ammonia, Anhydrous (toxic gas)\nArea/Unit: Area 2 Tank Farm\nAdministrative Controls Considered: Quantity stored limited to 80% of capacity by written operating procedures\nPassive Mitigation Considered: None\nOffsite Impacts: Yes\n\nRegulated Substance: Flammable Liquid\nArea/Unit: Area 2 Tank Farm\nAdministrative Controls Considered: Quantity stored limited to 87% of capacity by written operating procedures \nPassive Mitigation Considered: None\nOffsite Impacts: Yes\n\n3.2  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nIn addition to worst case scenarios, this RMP contains a second set of release scenarios designated as alternative release scenarios (ARS).

Although these scenarios may be unlikely to occur, they are physically possible and reasonably feasible.  \n\nEPA OCAG procedures were not used for modeling the alternative release scenarios.

Process Safety Information (PSI), which addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, limits for specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information, was compiled for each process unit.\n\nPSI is used in process unit hazard analyses, inspection, maintenance, and training activities.  This information is kept current by management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures, which are discussed further in this section.\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazards Analysis\n\nBWC conducts process hazards analyses (PHAs) to ensure that hazards associated with process units are identified and controlled.  Under this program, each process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate control is in place to manage those hazards.  SBR has used the hazard and operability study methodology as the refinery's primary process hazards analysis technique.  Some of the revalidation has been done using the \"what if\" and risk matrix methodologies.  Pertinent parameters, such as flow, temperature, pressure, and liquid level, were reviewed.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate "

The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes.  A walk through was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company.  The objective of seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substance having off-site consequence would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computerized tracking system.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nBWC has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.  The written operating procedures address the various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.\n\nThese procedures are used as references by experienced operators and for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them to reflect changes made through the management of change process and through annual certification.\n\n4.4  Training\n\nBWC's general policy requires operating personnel to be trained in the safe operation of facilities, handling process upsets, emergency response, and personal safety.  Employees who understand the process and how to safely operate a process can significantly decrease the number and severity of incidents.  \n\nRefresher training for all operations and maintenance employees in Safety, Health, and Environmental subjects and operating procedures (as appropriate) is provided at varying intervals, depending upon requirements. \n\n4.5  Management of Change\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) review is required for modifications to facilities or changes to p"

The requirements for Management of Change are documented in a written procedure.  Management of Change information is kept for the life of the process unit.\n\n4.6  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe purpose of the Pre-Startup Safety Review is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides additional assurance that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review also verifies that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nPre-startup reviews are goverened by a written Pre-Startup Safety review procedure and covers a variety or issues, including:\n\n* construction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications;\n* safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate;\n* for new facilities, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before start-up;\n* modified facilities have complied with MOC requirements including updating of the process safety information (e.g., piping instrument diagrams, operating procedures, etc.); \n* training of each applicable operating employee and maintenance worker has been completed.\n\n4.7  Mechanical Integrity\n\nBWC has established and implemented written procedures to maintain the ongoing integrity of process equipment, pressure vessels and storage tanks, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, and controls.\n\nThe BWC mechanical integrity program follows r"

The compilation of this information satisfies the requirements of the federal Risk Management Program and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implementing regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68).\n\nThe five-year accident history provides an explanation of the factors that caused the accident, the on- and off-site impacts of the accident, and the changes made by SBR to minimize the likelihood that these accidents will occur again.\n\nBWC reviewed all incident, emergency release, and equipment breakdown reports from June 1998 through May 2002 to identify accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes that involved the impacts described above.   One incident involving a regulated substance from a covered process was identified:  a gas release involving a regulated toxic substance that resulted in an injury to an employee.  SBR substituted the regulated toxic substance with a more inherently safe substance throughout the refinery as a result of the incident.\n\nSection 6.
