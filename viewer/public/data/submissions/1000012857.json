We will comply with all environmental regulations and policies. Operating our plant without spills or releases is equivalent to operating with zero injuries and of higher priority than production. It is our responsibility to operate and maintain our plant without spills to prevent any impact on ourselves, our coworkers and the community around us. Our business and customers expect us to operate in this manner. \n\nIn addition we have environmental and safety cardinal rules that cover proper operation of pollution control equipment, data integrity, reporting of all spills and releases, and change management for all process revisions. \n\n\nBayport Facility and Chemicals Handled:\n\nThe Bayport plant is a chemical manufacturing facility. Primary products are specialty monomers. End use applications range from contact lenses, paints and adhesives.\n\nWe handle ethylene oxide and propylene oxide in 165,000 lb. rail cars.\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst case toxic release scenario is the EPA defined complete release of 165,000 lb. ethylene oxide from a rail car in 10 minutes with complete failure of our emergency systems and our highly trained personnel standing by  and  watching without responding. For this case, per EPA RMP Comp, the eth"

With detection (LEL instrumentation) and response (closure of excess flow valves) the release travels 0.31 miles, and thus no residences are impacted.\n\nFor ethylene oxide and propylene oxide alternative release scenarios are a failure of an air pollution control device for ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. With detection (process control instrumentation) and response (shut down of unit operation) neither of  the releases travel off site, and thus no residences are impacted.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs:\n\nIncluded in the Bayport plant\u00c2\u00bfs accidental release prevention plans are fully automated processes with level and flow measurement and control, minimum inventories of chemicals, excess flow control valves, automatic emergency shut-off valves, redundant safety interlocks, preventative maintenance programs, chemical detectors, remotely operated valves to isolate and minimize a release, and annual training of employees. \n\nIncluded in the Bayport plant's emergency response program are fully trained exterior and interior fire brigade, fully trained Technician level HAZMAT team for both onsite and offsite response, fully trained Emergency Medical Technician Basic team, fully trained High Angle and Confined Space Rescue team, fully trained incident commanders, onsite fire truck with foam capability, onsite mobile equipment for HAZMAT response, member CIMA (Channel Industry Mutual Aid), water spray deluge systems, sewer spill isolation valves and catch basin, notification systems including plant wide notification and portable radios, neighbor and community notification procedures including use of CAER line, and chemical detectors strategically located. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nWe have had no reportable releases of covered chemicals in the last 5 years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Pr"
