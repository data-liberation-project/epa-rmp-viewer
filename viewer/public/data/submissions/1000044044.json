Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\r\n\r\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Central Farm Service, St. James, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\r\n\r\nThe facility has 1-18,000 gallon storage tank; 1-26,000 gallon storage tank; and 3-30,000 gallon storage tanks with an approximate bulk storage capacity of 625,000 pounds; and additional available capacity of approximately 143,000 pounds in 1,000 and 1,450 gallon nurse tanks.  While rail unload is uncommon at this facility, the maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of tank railcar holding approximately 160,000 pounds. The typical maximum quantity handled would be a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections. Visual checks are to be condu"
