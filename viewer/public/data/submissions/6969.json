Our goals are to promote and \n  strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Site 2 implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Site 2 uses 1,3 Butadiene. This chemical is used to manufacture a water based emulsion polymer or dispersion. This dispersion is used primarily as a binder in carpet backing. The plant also makes products for paper coating and adhesive applications.  \n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\n7 Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 1,3 butadiene with off-site impacts.    \n\nAlternative\n\n7 Jet fire resulting from the release of 1,3 butadiene with off-site impacts.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release(s) over the past five years, which meets the reporting criteria.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  Hazmat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, etc.\n\nFor example, some changes that will be initiated prior to the end of 1999 will improve the safety of our regulated processes and include:\n\n- Installation of remotely actuated isolation valves for all of the 1,3 butadiene storage tanks. \n- Installation of density meters on the drains of 1,3 butadiene storage vessels to"
