The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The Bell County WCID #1 Water Treatment Facility implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel will coordinate with local emergency response agencies and first responders to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tDescription of The Bell County WCID #1 Water Treatment Facility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Bell County WCID #1 Water Treatment Facility handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is: Chlorine\r\n\r\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\r\n \r\nThe RMP Rule requires The Bell County WCID #1 Water Treatment Facility to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\r\n \r\n* Three worst-case and Three alternative release scenario for the stored and in service Chlorine utilized in the chlorination process unit at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Bell County WCID #1 Water Treatment Facility completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the lo"
