The extruded product is in sheet form. This sheet is converted into various products.\n\n\t Difluoroethane is delivered to R L Adams Plastics via tanker truck. The driver has to sign in and be approved for delivery. The Difluoroethane is unloaded using a truck mounted pump to the aboveground tank with maximum quantity of 45,000 lbs. using a vapor recovery system that prevents the release of vapors. The truck is bonded to the earth ground to prevent sparks. The driver must be qualified and trained in the safe handling of this product. The driver must be with the truck continuously throughout the unloading procedure. \n\n\t 1.\t R.L. Adams Plastics Inc. works closely with the City of Wyoming Fire Department for the process information and updates of changes. The Wyoming Fire Department is our first responder.\n\n\t 2. \tR.L. Adams Plastics Inc. insures the safe handling of Difluoroethane using various procedures. \t\n\t\tA. Training for the safe practices of isopentane .this includes all new employees, also annual reviews with all employees, and updates on a continuing basis.\n  \n\t\t B. The use of monitoring equipment to ensure that safe levels of Difluoroethane are maintained. The use of FID \u00bfflame ionized detectors\u00bf hand held monitor for actual PPM testing. Permanent mounted gas detection system that monitors the PPM and automatically calls from emergency telephone call list at specific alarm levels. The use of hand held gas detectors at the beginning of each shift. In addition, the use of hand held monitors for the maintenance department\u00bfs use in hot work permits.\n\n\t 3.

      "SummaryText": "The largest release of Difluoroethane possible would be the total contents of the 45,000 lbs. in the tank that would spill into the secondary containment dike and pool at a rate of 138 lbs. / min. This pool would vaporize at a rate of 1380 lbs in ten minutes. It is assumed that an ignition source would ignite this vapor cloud causing an explosion. Estimated distance to 1psi. overpressure: is .2 miles. Assumptions made are wind speed of 3.4 MPH and a temperature of 77\u00b0 F. \n\n\t 4. Alternate scenario was calculated using RMP Comp. (ver.1.07)\n\t\tThe extreme alternate scenario would involve a rupture of the transfer hose. Assuming the excess flow valves fail and the snap valve fails resulting in a \nLeak of Difluoroethane at a rate of 204 lbs. per minute for a duration of 2 minutes  resulting  in a vapor cloud assuming an ignition source and lead to an explosion. Using the RMP Comp. table the estimated distance to lower flammability limit is .1 miles. Assumptions made are wind speed at 6.7 MPH and a temperature of 77\u00b0 F.\n\n\t 5. The general accidental release prevention program and specific chemical \t\t     prevention.\n\t\tThe overall safety program at R.L. Adams Plastics Inc. begins with management commitment to the overall safe practices and polices to protect our employees and community. This facility has specific safety procedures and policies that directly relate to Difluoroethane and are strictly enforced. Starting with training of new employees at orientation to annual training of all employees and updates as needed of Difluoroethane safety and right to know. Strict zero tolerance no smoking and open flame policies are in effect. Using only trained and qualified personnel in the transportation and delivery of Difluoroethane.  The permanently mounted gas leak - detection systems with continuous monitoring, and test procedures that are done at each shift of operation to forewarn of possible leak potentials. Control measures are taken from the storage of Difluoroethane thro"
