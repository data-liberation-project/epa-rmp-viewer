We do this to promote plant, worker and public safety. \n\nThese programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Combined, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and avoid physical property damage. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nBongards' Creameries Perham is a 10 acre Cheese and Whey production facility located within the Perham city limits. Industrial activities include the intake of 4.2 million pounds of milk per day for the purpose of cheese production. The whey from the cheese production is processed and dried on site. There are warehouses on site for the storage of the cheese and whey production.\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA USE \n\nThe process covered by the Bongards' PSM/RMP programs is the ammonia refrigeration system.   Anhydrous ammonia. 18,287 lbs, is utilized in the refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system provides cooling for food processing and storage operations at the facility.  The refrigeration process involves a typical vapor compression refrigeration cycle with compressors, condensers, chillers and evaporators.  The system is closed and is designed to completely contain the ammonia refrigerant within vessels, equipment and piping specifically constructed for ammonia refrigeration.  Liquid ammonia is circulated from the vessels to the evaporators and chillers which cool the process and the refrigerated spaces by boiling off some of the liquid to vapor.  The ammonia then returns to the"

The vapor is cooled and condenses to liquid in the condenser and then drained to the vessels to repeat the refrigeration cycle.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of these chemicals. Any group of vessels, which are interconnected, and separate vessels, which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process. \n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules of 29 CFR 1910.119, procedures and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and acknowledged by all employees at the facility. \n\nFailure of the vertical recirculator containing is limited to 3481 pounds of ammonia at 80% full by facility procedures could result in a 10 minute release of ammonia. \n\nThis scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\tWorst-case weather conditions are uncommon\n\tIndustry standards for the vessel manufacture and quality control\n\tAmmonia is not corrosive in this application\n\tPressure safety valves protecting this vessel are installed\n\tAccident prevention and mechanical integrity programs are in place\n\tInspection, testing and replacement programs are in place;\t\n        Trained operators monitor the system regularly\n\tLog sheets are completed and maintained as a means to detect problems before they get to dangerous levels\n\tAmmonia sensors are in place to warn of leaks immediately\n\tAn emergency action plan and equipment are in place at the plant\n\nOther release scenarios such as a transfer hose rupturing or a flange leaking could result in a release of ammonia in 60 minutes. \n\nThe transfer hose rupture scenario was chosen as an alt"
