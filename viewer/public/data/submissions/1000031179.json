The primary purpose of this facility is to further process meat into food products for distribution to retailers.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. Ammonia as contained in equipment in the facility is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  The facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \r\n\r\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since 1999 under the PSM and RMP requirements. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.  This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental r"
