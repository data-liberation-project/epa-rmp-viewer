      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nTurner Road Vintners (TRV - West) is committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  The facility has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nTRV - West is located at 5852 West Turner Road in Lodi, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage of wine product.  The system uses a maximum of 80,500 pounds of ammonia.  A description of how the process operates is presented below:    \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the two high pressure receivers (HPR1 and HPR2).  The liquid can be pumped back and forth between the two receivers as needed.  Liquid is transferred from both receivers to two recirculators (RP1 and RP2) and the wine chillers.  Liquid ammonia from HPR1 is also used for liquid injection for oil cooling purposes in the compressors.  \n\n\n\nAssociated with RP1 is a liquid transfer unit (LTU), which collects excess liquid ammonia from the recirculator and transfers the liquid back to HPR1.  Compressor discharge is used to pressurize the LTU and facilitate the transfer of liquid.   \n\n\n\nRecirculated liquid from RP-1 is pumped to a set of wine tanks (T357"

      "FacilityID": 1000081500,
      "SummaryText": "-T380, T520, and T521), which return recirculated suction to the same vessel.  RP-2 pumps recirculated liquid to the remaining wine tanks (T426-T443); suction generated at these tanks is returned to RP-2.  \n\n\n\nPrior to entering the chillers, the high pressure liquid ammonia (supplied by HPR 1 and HPR2) passes through a hand expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid.  The liquid is then fed to the shell side of the chillers and is vaporized as it absorbs heat from wine product flowing through the tubes.  The ammonia vapor is drawn off to either RP-1 (for wine chillers WC1-WC10) or RP-2 (for wine chillers WC11-WC18).\n\n\n\nThe pressure/temperature of the recirculators is maintained by the compressors, which draw suction from the vessels.  The pressure and temperature of the low pressure vapor is then increased.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and drained to HPR 1.\n\n\n\nCompressor discharge/hot gas is also routed to Wine Chillers WC4 and WC11, which are designed to either cool or heat wine product, depending on temperature demand.  When in heating mode, hot gas enters the chillers and is condensed to a liquid as it heats wine product flowing through the chiller tubes.  Using pumps associated with the chillers, the condensed liquid is transferred from the chillers to HPR1.    \n\n \n\nThe process also has an ammonia diffusion panel which is used only in an emergency situation to equalize the pressures between the low side and the high side, or to manually diffuse the system pressure to the facility's water sump.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTRV - West has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the EPA RMP and OES CalARP regulations.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n\n\na) Safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, and operating and technical specification"

Examples of these controls include:\n\n \n\n1) Equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  \n\n2) Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  \n\n3) The Engine Room is equipped with ammonia detectors to warn personnel of a leak, and a ventilation system to provide continuous and emergency ventilation.  \n\n4) Emergency stop switches for the process are in place to allow personnel to stop flow of ammonia or shut down the system in case of adverse conditions.  \n\n\n\nRegular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).

An incident investigation was conducted for each incident to determine the cause(s) and to implement any necessary measures to prevent their recurrence.  The associated reports are maintained onsite in an electronic database.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nTRV - West has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, the procedures within the EAP will be implemented.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis (completed in March 2019) resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  A representative sample of the recommendations generated is listed below:\n\n\n\n1) Review / field-verify the operating procedures and update as needed.\n\n2) Revise the P&IDs to reflect as-built status and correct operating conditions.\n\n3) Perform compressor vibration analysis.\n\n4) Label the newly-painted equipment in accordance with IIAR Bulletin 114.\n\n\n\nTRV - West is moving forward with completing the recommendations.  In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, continued implementation and upkeep of the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements.\n\n\n\n"
