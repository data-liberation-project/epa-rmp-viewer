(IBP) Grand Rapids, Michigan facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to IBP employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all IBP owned activities at this facility.\n\nIBP's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nIBP Foods, Inc. (IBP) operates a hot dog and sliced meat processing facility at this location.  Support operations include cold storage, an analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\n\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting ("

      "SummaryText": "urban or rural).\n\nThe alternative release scenario must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\n\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B ?68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  \"Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\"\n\nDue to the presence of trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Grand Rapids, Michigan facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\n\nAmmonia\n\nThe data provided in the document EPA's guidance document \"Risk Management Program Guidance For Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case ammonia release scenario.  Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized system containing liquid; the released gas should be classified as a dense gas (a result of evaporative cooling).  The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the high pressure receiver in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).  This release translates to a release of 18,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 1,800 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the high pressure receiver is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 me"

The results of the worst-case assessment for ammonia show that the plume must travel 1.62 miles (2.6 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm.\n\nThe data provided in the document EPA's guidance document \"Risk Management Program Guidance For Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case and alternative ammonia release scenarios.  The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity).  The selected alternative release scenario for the ammonia systems is a release from a process piping failure.  The pipe rupture is assumed to result in a 1-inch by 1/4-inch opening.  At the system pressure, a release rate of 159 pounds per minute would result from the opening.  The release would last 15 minutes and result in a release of 2,400 pounds of ammonia.  The table from the ammonia refrigeration document (Exhibit 4-5, page 4-15) was used to determine the endpoint distance for the worst-case release scenario.  The results of the alternative release scenario for an ammonia release indicates that the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm is reached at 0.1 miles (160 meters) from the release point.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Grand Rapids, Michigan facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n\n* 2"

IBP has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by IBP management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia systems.  IBP employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\n\nIBP policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  IBP maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\n\nIBP is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, IBP conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.  Members of IBP's emergency response team receive annual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nIBP has not had a release of ammonia from the Grand Rapids, Michigan facility that has affected the public or the environment.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIBP has personnel trained in emergency response at the facility 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
