The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility management has developed an emergency response plan along with training to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\n\nIn order to prevent a potential ammonia release at any Atlas facility, the Company has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures.  This assists in ensuring the refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and all other local, state and federal regulatory agency safety standards, as well as its own internal standards.  \n\nAtlas Logistics - Shelbyville has a rigorous emergency response training program that follows the guidelines of federal, state and local regulatory agencies.  The management believes that cooperative emergency response training must include Company employees, local emergency responders and regulatory agency people in order to provide a safe workplace and a safe environment.  In an emergency, all personnel are required to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel as directed by the Emergency Response Incident Commander.  \n\nAtlas Logistics is a refrigerated warehousing facility.  Products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the commonly used refrigerant in industrial grade refrigeration systems that maintain low storage temperatures and can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility operations.  The refrigeration system in this facility contains approximately 41,850 pounds of ammonia inventory for this process."

The primary purpose of this is to assist the local Emergency Planning Commission with additional information if an accidental release was to occur.  The release model used was the EPA supplied RMP*Comp.  \n\nIn the worst case scenario, a pipe at the high pressure receiver liquid outlet is broken allowing the entire liquid ammonia charge of that receiver to be released in ten minutes.\n\n-2-\n\nBased on the RMP*Comp models, this scenario could have a potential offsite area of concern extending to a radius of 1 mile.\n\nIn an alternate scenario, a relief valve opens from some process upset and allows a ten minue release of ammonia gas from the high pressure receiver.  Based on the RMP*Comp model, this scenario could present a potential offsite area of concern extending to a radius of 0.1 miles.\n\nThese scenario plans are maintained at the site and are used for training and provide information for responders and for the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nAtlas Logistics is committed to safe managerment and operation of the closed ammonia refrigeration system.  Maintenance employees are trained to observe operational procedures designed to be as fail-safe as possible to prevent accidental releases of ammonia at any time. Should any accidental release occur, maintenance employees are certified emergency hazardous material responders and are required to observe safe emergency response porcedures.  They are trained to work in conjunction with the local emergency planning commission to minimize the impact of any accidental release.\n\nWe have adopted the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) as an integral part of our Company Safety Manual.  The PSM Program has been implemented and covers the entire scope of safe operating procedures of the ammonia refrigeration system from start-up and normal operations to potentia"

Normal operations rely on the following:\n Maintenance Management Procedures are used to perform preventative maintenance and to maintain records of all maintenance work performed.  This helps to ensure that the closed ammonia system continues to operate safely, reliably and efficiently in the originally intended manner.\n Any set specifications of system termperature, pressure, level or power interruption that are exceeded or violated will normally trigger an alarm and safety shutdown.  Maintenance technicians are notified of a deviation from normal operational specifications through indicator or alarm systems.\n In the event of deviations, technicians are trained to analyze the situation, follow personal safety procedures at all times, determine that everything is under control and correct problems and/or deviations.\n If a problem cannot be corrected immediately, the equipment needing repairs will be safely locked out of service until such time as repairs have been completed.\n If a problem cannot be safely handled by staff maintenance personnel, procedures are in place to obtain required resources to correct the situation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE OPERATIONS READINESS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:\n Written procedures for emergency operations include emergency evacuation procedures, emergency shutdown instructions, emergency response training expectations, emergency response unit coordination plans, regulatory agency notification and other pertinent information.\n The Emergency Response Plan is a valuable tool used in an ammonia emergency situation.
