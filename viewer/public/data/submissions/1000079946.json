The primary business of the C&S Suffield facility is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 15,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for glycol chilling, dock operations and cold storage. \r\n\r\nOff-site Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nC&S has conducted an OCA based o"

This data were then used to estimate the potential impact caused by a release from each of the regulated substances.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAs required by regulations, scenarios were considered where the entire capacity of the largest vessel for each regulated chemical at the facility was released in 10 minutes. Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies with a maximum possible impact in the event of an accidental release. In considering these releases, the most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used. Passive mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAlternative scenarios were developed to assess what potential impact may occur in the event of a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios for each of the regulated chemicals. Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\r\n\r\nProcess Description\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Condenser to the Thermosyphon Receiver.

The subcooled liquid refrigerant is fed to the -20F Pump Recirculator and the vapor ('flashed' from the liquid bath) is drawn by the High Stage Compressors.  The level of the liquid bath is maintained via a float switch on the vessel which controls the operating position (open/closed) of a solenoid valve connected to the liquid inlet to the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe +20F Pump Recirculator pumps liquid ammonia to evaporators in the Medium Temperature Evaporators (AU9 thru AU16 and AU24 thru AU25) and the Dock Evaporators (AU18 thru AU23), while the -20F Pump Recirculator pumps liquid ammonia to evaporators in the Low Temperature Evaporators (AU1 thru AU8).  At the evaporators, the liquid ammonia, flowing through coils in the unit, is partially boiled as it absorbs heat from the product and room.  The resulting 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) is returned to the pump package which supplied each evaporator, wherein the liquid drops to the bottom of the vessel (to be reused in the refrigeration of the warehouse) and vapor is drawn from the top by the applicable compressor (see below).\r\n\r\nThe Low Stage Compressors (3) draw vapor from the -20F Pump Recirculator and the High Stage Compressors (4) draw vapor from the +20F Pump Recirculator and the Intercooler.  At the Low Stage Compressors, the pressure of the ammonia vapor is raised and then discharged to the Intercooler, where it is 'bubbled' through the ammonia bath to desuperheat the vapor.  The vapor discharged from the High Stage Compressors is primarily routed to the Condensers, but also used in the Glycol Heat Exchanger and in the defrost cycle of the evaporators.

The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S Suffield Facility employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room, in the cold storage areas which will alert operators in the event of ammonia detection. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no federally reportable incidents nor any that resulted in serious injuries or offsite consequences within the last five years (June 2014 - June 2019). \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.
