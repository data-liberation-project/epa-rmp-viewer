The facility's mailing address is 214 Main St. PMB #286, El Segundo, California, 90245. The Hydrogen Facility's size is approximately 3.5 acres, and it is located in the south east corner of the refinery. The area directly east of the facility is predominately zoned for heavy industrial activities. However, to the South residential property is located within approximately 0.4 miles. Also, no environmental receptors have been identified within this area.\r\n\r\nThe products from the Hydrogen Facility are hydrogen and steam. The unit produces raw hydrogen, which is then purified. There are three types of feed stock for the unit: pentane, natural gas, and refinery fuel gas. The fuel for the reformer furnace is off-gas from the pressure swing adsorption unit, supplemented with refinery fuel gas or natural gas.\r\nThe hydrogen process is a combination of feedstock and product streams and meets the criteria for classification as a flammable mixture pursuant to the regulations at Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (19 CCR), Division 2, Chapter 4.5,  Section 2770.2 (b)(2). The total quantity of flammable mixture present at the facility is 44884 pounds. The quantity of flammable mixture exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for both the EPA RMP and CalARP regulations, therefore; considered a covered process.\r\nFacility personnel have completed a determination for the quantities of all potentially regulated substances at the facility. Refer to Appendix A, A-1 for the calculations regarding the flammable mixture for RMP and CalARP regulations.  \r\n\r\n1.3 \tHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\nTo meet the EPA RMP and the CalARP regulations, the Hydrogen Facility has analyzed several worst-case scenarios to determine the scenario with the greatest distance in any direction to the end point resulting from an accidental r"

(Air Liquide) operates a hydrogen plant within the Chevron refinery located in El Segundo, California (Hydrogen Facility). This document addresses the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CaIARP) program with regards to the hydrogen processes on site. The following summarizes the required elements of a Program 1 facility.\r\n\r\n1.1 \tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nOur commitment to Safety and Environmental Protection in the Air Liquide, El Segundo Hydrogen Plant must extend beyond the gates. As part of the community, we have a responsibility to our customers and to those who live in the surrounding area to help provide a safe working and living environment. Through safety, concern for the environment, and community involvement, we can develop a true partnership with our customers and neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe Hydrogen Facility has accidental release protection programs for all covered processes, which includes a prevention program with the following elements:\r\n\u00bf\tMaintaining up-to-date safety information;\r\n\u00bf\tConducting a process hazard analysis;\r\n\u00bf\tImplementing operating procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tImplementing a staff training program;\r\n\u00bf\tImplementing a maintenance program;\r\n\u00bf\tConducting compliance audits; and\r\n\u00bf\tConducting incident investigations.\r\n\r\nAn Emergency Action Plan has been developed to help instruct personnel how to respond in case of an emergency. Emergency response actions involve the system operators and maintenance staff, as well as the local El Segundo Fire Department. In addition, the Plant Manager or an appointed representative serves as the focal point during and following an accidental release for notifying the Chevron El Segundo Refinery, reporting to the appropriate agencies, and providing information to the public.\r\n\r\n1.2 \tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE"

Administrative controls and passive mitigation devices are present to mitigate off-site consequences, however none of these devices were considered in the Worst Case Scenario (WCS). Historical data from industry reported chemical accidents were reviewed to ensure a credible event was chosen. All modeling was done with EPA RMP*Comp version 2.01.\r\nIt was determined from the analysis of flammable mixture, that the pentane feedstock had the greatest distance in any direction to the end point resulting from an accidental release of regulated flammable substance from covered processes.\r\n1.3.1 WCS Flammable\r\nThe pentane feedstock meets the criteria for classification as a flammable mixture, which consists of butane, isopentane, and pentane. The predominant component in this mixture is isopentane. The largest quantity of this flammable mixture contained in a single location within the facility is at the pentane feed surge drum, V-100. The maximum quantity of flammable mixture that could be contained in this vessel has been estimated at 30,754 pounds. The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a flammable material at the Hydrogen Facility is a catastrophic failure of the feed surge drum due to over-pressurization from a fire near the tank. The WCS has been modeled such that the entire contents of this vessel are released as a vapor within 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP*Comp software was used to model this WCS. The estimated impacts (distance to endpoint) from the worst-case release scenario involving the flammable mixture extends to 0.2 miles. Within this circle of 0.2 miles radius, there are no public receptors. The closest area onsite that is occupied by the onsite contractors is a small parking lot on the Chevron Refinery. This lot is 0.28 miles from the pentane tank, which is outside the modeled WCS area.\r\n\r\n1.4 \tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nIn addition t"
