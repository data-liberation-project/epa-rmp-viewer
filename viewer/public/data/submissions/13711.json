Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at PCS Nitrogen Fertilizer, L.P. - Memphis Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We are also completely coordinated with Memphis & Shelby County Emergency Management Agency which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities consist of manufacturing nitrogen-based chemicals (ammonia and urea) and carbon dioxide.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous), Ammonia (aqueous, concentration 20% or greater) and Formaldehyde (solution).  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is a manufactured product, as well as a feedstock chemical in the urea production process.  Ammonia (aqueous) is a by-product of the urea production process.  Formaldehyde (solution) is an additive used as a conditioning agent in the prilling portion of the urea production process.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 33,345,700 lb. while Ammonia (aqueous) and Formaldehyde (solution) are present at our facility in quantities of 184,750 lb. and 477,400 lb., respectively.\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "ols and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Anhydrous Ammonia Production, Shipping, and Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 2,600,000 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 22 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Pressurized Ammonia Storage Sphere #1 in the Anhydrous Ammonia Production, Shipping, and Storage process.  The scenario involves the release of 9,660 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 15 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include water curtain(s) and emergency shutdown systems.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is 0.43 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (aqueous) involves a release from Urea Production.  The scenario involves the release of 3,750 lb.  Liquid is assumed to be released to form a pool from which evaporation takes place.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is 0.28 miles.\n\nThe alternative release  scenario for Formaldehyde (solution) involves a release from Urea Production.  The  scenario involves the release of 3,000 lb.  Liquid is assumed to be released to form a pool from which eva"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition, ASME, and local building codes.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  We also have applied for an operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPCS Nitrogen Fertilizer, L.P. - Memphis Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is typically the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study method.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five (5) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, PCS Nitrogen Fertilizer, L.P. - Memphis Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emer"
