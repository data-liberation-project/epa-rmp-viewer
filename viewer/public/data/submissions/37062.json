The General Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs.\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence , and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.

The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in each system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum combined inventory of both system is 48,000 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from both systems could pose a risk of offsite public impact and both systems are regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\nThe closed ammonia refrigeration system removes heat from the storage and blast freezers of the 4.8 million cubic foot facility.  Two refrigeration systems provide two-stage and single-stage operation with screw compressors for the -35\u00a1 blast and -10\u00a1 freezers.  The sub-zero temperatures are provided with low pressure ammonia suction and liquid lines via pumped recirculating accumulators.  The higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\nC.\tDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\n\nD.\tFive-Year Accident History\nNo ammonia-related incidents were identified for the facility in the previous five years which resulted in significant on-site or off-site consequences.\nE.\tDescription of the Emergency Response Program\nThis"
