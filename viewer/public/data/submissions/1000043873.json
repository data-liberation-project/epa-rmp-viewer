MCP is committed to being a responsible member of the Martinez and greater Contra Costa County communities.  We place a high priority on operating our facility in a safe, healthful, and environmentally sound manner.\r\n\r\nShell and CRI requirements dictate that their facilities continually identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials, evaluate risk, and reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of process design, engineering controls, and safe work practices and procedures.  This commitment to healthy, safe, secure and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Shell HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, and The Environment) Commitment and Policy.  The MCP Risk Management Program (RMP) is incorporated into this HSSE Commitment and Policy through the MCP Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental Management System or HSSE-MS.    Specific Plant RMP-related action items are identified, evaluated, resourced, and checked via an internal action tracking tool.  These documents, as well as other related materials are readily available to all workers.\r\n\r\nMCP practically stresses safe, healthful, secure, and environmentally sound operations via an annual employee training program, various safety meetings, the Plant HSSE Committee and the Social Performance, Employee Activities, and Recognition Group (SPEAR) MCP has a Health, Safety, Security, And Environmental (HSSE) and Administrative Procedures Manual that comprehensively covers various aspects of management systems conformance.  Each employee and field contractor at MCP also receives a Basic HSSE Requirements Handbook.   Shell also maintains internal HSSE Audit and Management Review programs under its HSSE-MS.

Management reviews occur continually throughout the year and at least annually.\r\n\r\nA Description of The Martinez Catalyst Plant and The Regulated Substances Handled.\r\n\r\nThe Martinez Catalyst Plant consists of 2 main batch processes: Ethylene Oxide (EO) Catalyst and RM-17.  The EO Catalyst Process produces a silver-based catalyst that is sold to industrial customers that convert hydrocarbons to ethylene oxide.  A specially formulated impregnating solution is produced at the Plant and absorbed onto carrier pellets to make the EO Catalyst products. \r\n\r\nThe RM-17 product is manufactured by reacting a proprietary raw material (containing toluene as a carrier) with a heavy olefin in the presence of a liquid catalyst.  A series of simple distillation steps removes the lighter boiling components (including the toluene).  The purified product is then shipped to other Shell Chemical facilities for further use in the process of manufacturing detergent products.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Management System Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\n\r\nThe Martinez Catalyst Plant has developed a formal Risk Management system based on CCPS Plant Guidelines for Technical Management of Chemical Process Safety and Shell HSSE-MS requirements.  This system is designed to plan, organize, implement and control the risk management program elements.  This management system satisfies the requirements of Section 2735.6 of the CalARP regulation (and EPA equivalent) and ensures that the risk management program elements are developed and continually improved.  Records associated with the prevention program elements are retained for a minimum of five years unless otherwise specified.   The management system activities are further discussed below.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPlanning - The Martinez Catalyst Plant has an overall HSSE program policy that identifies the objectives of its HSSE programs.  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOrganizing - Individuals responsible for each risk management pr"

Many of these prevention programs (e.g., process hazards analysis or PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigation) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (e.g., administrative and engineering controls).  Those recommendations that are planned for implementation at the Martinez Catalyst Plant will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\" Section.

MCP personnel use information regarding chemical hazards, equipment specifications, and operating limits in daily and strategic decision making.  Accurate and complete information that is readily accessible to employees and field contractors is therefore a basic component of the OSHA PSM/EPA/CalARP prevention program.\r\n\r\nEstablished practices made sure that the original PSI was compiled in conjunction with the initial process hazard analyses (PHAs).  These practices ensure that relevant PSI is maintained current via the management of change (MOC), pre-startup safety review (PSSR), and other (e.g., hazard communication, etc.) programs.  Hard copies of the PSI are maintained (in various forms) in the Operations Supervisor's Office and the Administration Building.  An electronic copy of much of the information is also available.  Personnel have access to PSI information on a 24-hour basis.

Various technical resources (Process Engineer, Plant Engineer, Control Systems Engineer, Operations and Maintenance) made sure that the level of scope and the level of detail was appropriate to safe MCP operations.  This PSI enables personnel involved in the operation of the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving regulated substances such as ethylenediamine (EDA).

They also verify that all equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nBy systematically examining and identifying process safety hazards associated with the operation of a covered process, the Martinez Catalyst Plant has been able to plan and take appropriate action to improve the safety of our workers, the community, and the environment.

The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against reoccurrence.  \r\n\r\nDuring the 2014 PHA and the County Cal-ARP (1Q 2014), FIM incident investigation reports back to 2009 were reviewed.

Ten minutes was the time determined for the release to be detected, the system remotely isolated, and the pump shut down upon detection of the leak. This scenario was chosen through consultation with MCP Operations and Process Engineering.  It is considered to be the worse credible scenario associated with the batch handling of EDA.
