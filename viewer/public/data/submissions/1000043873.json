MCP is committed to being a responsible member of the Martinez and greater Contra Costa County communities.  We place a high priority on operating our facility in a safe, healthful, and environmentally sound manner.\n\n\n\nShell and CRI requirements dictate that their facilities continually identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials, evaluate risk, and reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of process design, engineering controls, and safe work practices and procedures.  This commitment to healthy, safe, secure and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Shell HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, and The Environment) Commitment and Policy.  The MCP Risk Management Program (RMP) is incorporated into this HSSE Commitment and Policy through the MCP Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental Management System or HSSE-MS.    Specific Plant RMP-related action items are identified, evaluated, resourced, and checked via an internal action tracking tool.  These documents, as well as other related materials are readily available to all workers.\n\n\n\nMCP practically stresses safe, healthful, secure, and environmentally sound operations via an annual employee training program, various safety meetings, the Plant HSSE Committee and the Social Performance, Employee Activities, and Recognition Group (SPEAR) MCP has a Health, Safety, Security, And Environmental (HSSE) and Administrative Procedures Manual that comprehensively covers various aspects of management systems conformance.  Each employee and field contractor at MCP also receives a Basic HSSE Requirements Handbook.   Shell also maintains internal HSSE Audit and Management Review programs under its HSSE-MS.

Management reviews occur continually throughout the year and at least annually.\n\n\n\nA Description of The Martinez Catalyst Plant and The Regulated Substances Handled.\n\n\n\nThe Martinez Catalyst Plant consists of 2 main batch processes: Ethylene Oxide (EO) Catalyst and RM-17.  The EO Catalyst Process produces a silver-based catalyst that is sold to industrial customers that convert hydrocarbons to ethylene oxide.  A specially formulated impregnating solution is produced at the Plant and absorbed onto carrier pellets to make the EO Catalyst products. \n\n\n\nThe RM-17 product is manufactured by reacting a proprietary raw material (containing toluene as a carrier) with a heavy olefin in the presence of a liquid catalyst.  A series of simple distillation steps removes the lighter boiling components (including the toluene).  The purified product is then shipped to other Shell Chemical facilities for further use in the process of manufacturing detergent products.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Management System Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\n\n\nThe Martinez Catalyst Plant has developed a formal Risk Management system based on CCPS Plant Guidelines for Technical Management of Chemical Process Safety and Shell HSSE-MS requirements.  This system is designed to plan, organize, implement and control the risk management program elements.  This management system satisfies the requirements of Section 2735.6 of the CalARP regulation (and EPA equivalent) and ensures that the risk management program elements are developed and continually improved.  Records associated with the prevention program elements are retained for a minimum of five years unless otherwise specified.   The management system activities are further discussed below.\n\n\n\n?

MCP personnel use information regarding chemical hazards, equipment specifications, and operating limits in daily and strategic decision making.  Accurate and complete information that is readily accessible to employees and field contractors is therefore a basic component of the OSHA PSM/EPA/CalARP prevention program.\n\n\n\nEstablished practices made sure that the original PSI was compiled in conjunction with the initial process hazard analyses (PHAs).  These practices ensure that relevant PSI is maintained current via the management of change (MOC), pre-startup safety review (PSSR), and other (e.g., hazard communication, etc.) programs.  Hard copies of the PSI are maintained (in various forms) in the Operations Supervisor's Office and the Administration Building.  An electronic copy of much of the information is also available.

These two faults, particularly the Concord fault, create most of the earthquake concern at the Martinez Site.\n\n\n\nAccording to the ABAG (Associated Bay Area Government) Liquefaction Susceptibility Map, the potential for liquefaction at MCP is very low.  Also, based on the 1994 UBC Seismic Zone Map of the United States, the Martinez Catalyst Plant is in Seismic Zone 4.  The ground surface at the MCP includes soils that have been disrupted, modified, removed, built over, or filled with crushed rock or other material resistant to weathering, such as blacktop (asphaltic compounds), concrete, or compacted gravel, sand, silt and clay.   Soil conditions are considered to be alternating layers of claystone, siltstone, and sandstone varying from dense to very dense.  Based on this information, the Site Coefficient is S1.

The compilation of this information satisfies the requirements of OSHA PSM, EPA RMP, and Section 2750.9 of the CalARP regulation.  The five-year accident history allows MCP to explain to the community the factors causing or contributing to accidental releases, the onsite and offsite impacts of accidental releases, and the procedural and technological changes made to minimize the likelihood that this accidental release will not occur again.   The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against reoccurrence.  \n\n\n\nDuring the 2014 PHA and the County Cal-ARP (1Q 2014), FIM incident investigation reports back to 2009 were reviewed.

No accidental releases of EPA or Cal-ARP regulated substances (e.g., EDA) were identified that met this criteria.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nOverall safety at the Martinez Catalyst Plant is governed not only by the ability to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases.

The hot work permit is terminated when continued use of the ignition source is hazardous, when conditions of its issuance change, or when the permitted hot work has been inactive for more than 2 hours (unless tests show that conditions are still non-hazardous). \n\n\n\nTwo copies of the hot work permit are maintained.  The first is available at the physical location of the hot work for the duration of the work.  The second is provided to the Operations Department where it is kept posted in the field.  The hot work permit contains the following information:\n\n\n\n?    The effective date and time;\n\n    \n\n?    The place of use;\n\n    \n\n?    The hours during which the source of ignition may be used, not to exceed 24 hours;\n\n    \n\n?
