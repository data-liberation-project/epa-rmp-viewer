Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to help ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. Contractors regularly participate in facility emergency drills.\n\nPreStartup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\nSweeny Complex conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make certain construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that Accidental Release Prevention Program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nSweeny Complex has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) Emergency Response Plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures confirm work is performed in a consistent manne"

Because processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nSweeny Complex management encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accidental prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Sweeny Complex's Accidental Release Prevention Program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the Accidental Release Prevention Program are documented in the Employee Participation Element of the Sweeny Complex Process Safety Management System and in addition, Sweeny Complex has a number of teams to promote both process safety and personal safety. The teams typically involve members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the Employee Behavioral Safety Process (RAPTOR) and the  Employee HES Excellence Team.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSweeny Complex maintains a variety of technical documents that are used in the safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information.  Process Safety Information reference documents are readily available as part of the written Employee Participation Plan to help employees locate any necessary Process Safety Info"

For specific process areas, the complex has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit-specific Process Safety Information (PSI) document.  The teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nSweeny Complex also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm the safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nSweeny Complex has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nSweeny Complex primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The tea"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA Team (using LOPA). This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo confirm that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design features Sweeny Complex periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nSweeny Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) Unit startup, (2) Normal operations, (3) Temporary operations, (4) Emergency shutdown, (5) Normal shutdown, and (6) Initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\nIn addition, Sweeny Complex maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny Complex has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nSweeny Complex uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Sweeny Complex evaluates contractor safety"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC Team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to verify the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance. Sweeny Complex incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSweeny Complex has developed a team-based defect elimination process. The objective of this employee-driven process is to eliminate equipment failures through predictive and preventive maintenance. As this process continues to mature, continuous and substantial improvement in operating reliability and safety is anticipated.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nSweeny Complex has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a Lockout/Tagout Procedure to verify isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), (5) a permit and procedure to confirm adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space, and (6)  a Safety and Emergency Systems Bypass Permit procedure.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes to be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) verify adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nSweeny Complex promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the Root Cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management and respective Teams for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teams findings and recommendations are tracked until these actions have been resolved. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by these findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years in order for these reports to be available for review during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nSweeny Complex periodically conducts compliance audits that include the following: Internal PSM and RMP Audits, Designated Self Audits (Safety and Health), and Operational Excelle"

The Emergency Response Program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in these changes.\n\nThe overall Emergency Response Program for Sweeny Complex is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes: local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Sweeny Complex has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings,  Sweeny Complex conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.  In addition to the LEPC, the Sweeny Complex also has a Mutual Aid System in place.  The Emergency Assistance Agreement Committee (EAAC) is a sub-committee of the Industrial CAER organization in the Brazosport area.  This system provides Mutual Aid from other industry members in the Brazosport area.  In addition, the Local Volunteer Fire Departments and West Brazos Emergency Medical Service would provide assistance in the event of an emergency at the Sweeny Complex.
