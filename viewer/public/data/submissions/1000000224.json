It is NOT affiliated with any other company or facility bearing that or a similar name.  An integral part of the margarine manufacturing process is the use of mechanical refrigeration to \"crystallize\" the product and to maintain the finished product at proper storage temperature prior to shipment.  At Dean Foods Company, the refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The refrigeration system is a \"closed system\" in which ammonia is never in direct contact with product.\n\nDean Foods is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management Regulations CFR Part 1910.119 as well as similar State Regulations.  The various elements of the Process Safety Management Program are in force at Dean Foods Company and form the core of the accidental release and emergency response efforts at the facility. Compliance with the Process Safety Management Program is Company policy.\n\nFollowing the guidelines set forth under the EPA Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations (i.e. 40 CFR PART 68) the Worst Case Scenario was identified as a catastrophic failure of the outside ammonia receiver tank such as could occur due to impact from a de-railed tank car. Worst Case Scenario modeling was performed using both \"RMP Compare\" and ALOHA with similar results.\n\nAdditionally, a more likely alternate scenario was investigated.  This release assumes that a forklift breaks a liquid ammonia supply line to an evaporator in a refrigerated storage warehouse.  The largest impact would be on the facility itself as the building would trap much of the ammonia inside thereby providing passive mitigation. The Alternate Release Scenario was performed using \"RMP Comp.\"\n\nDean Foods' accidental release prevention program includes all elements listed in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA 40 CFR Part 68 regulations and references industry standards, such as those published by the Internation"
