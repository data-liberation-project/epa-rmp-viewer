The safety of all employees, citizens, and neighbors is our highest priority.  If an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with the local fire departments, the Grady County LEPC, or any other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is a retail location for farm and ranch supplies, as well as the receiving of farmer produced grain.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, stored, and sold to farmers for crop production nutrients.  The farmer transports his anhydrous ammonia from our facility to his by utilizing a nurse tank that is pulled behind a pickup or tractor.  \n\n     The maximum amount stored in our 11,750 gallon storage tank is 55,000 pounds.  The maximum amount stored in our large nurse tanks is 6,612 pounds and 4,673 pounds in the smaller ones.  \n\n     The worst case release scenario would be the total release of the contents of our storage tank in a ten minute period, despite the presence of the installed safety devices.  The maximum quantity release would be 55,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  With a 1.5 meter per hour wind the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .74 miles.\n\n     An alternate release scenario, based on the most potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  If the safety check valve failed to operate in the event of a transfer hose rupture, approximately 11,908 pounds could be released in a 2 minute period.  With a 3 meter per hour wind  the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuri"
