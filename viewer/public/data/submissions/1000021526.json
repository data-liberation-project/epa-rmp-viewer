Active participation on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and regular interface with the fire department and other response agencies ensure a large team of experts is ready to respond should they be needed.  Familiarity with Penford's processes and chemicals, established emergency action plan, and extensive training help ensure local emergency agencies can provide the community appropriate support if needed.\n\nChemical Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nPenford is an industry whose primary business is the manufacture of specialty carbohydrate based products for food ingredients and the paper industry.  Penford is headquartered in Centennial, Colorado.   Penford's Idaho Falls facility has been in this location for over 90 years and is considered today to be an innovative leader in carbohydrate technology.\n\nIn the manufacture of its specialty carbohydrate based products, Penford uses propylene oxide, a chemical listed by the RMP rule as a regulated substance which is stored on site above the EPA threshold quantities.\n\nPropylene oxide is stored for use in the Hydroxypropyl Starch Process.  In this process a small quantity of propylene oxide is reacted with starch to structurally modify or alter the basic natural starch polymer.  The resulting hydroxypropylated starch is used in specialty food ingredient starches.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Penford Products Co. facility in Idaho Falls, Idaho.  Because processes at Penford that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary and the subsequent section on emergency response address each of the OSHA PSM elements and describe the management system in place to "

Employee Participation\n\nIt is Penford's policy to utilize the most knowledgeable and experienced resources available in the execution of its process safety and accident prevention programs.  To accomplish this, Penford encourages (and at times requires) contractors and employees at all levels of the organization to participate in these programs.  Operating unit personnel participate in hazard studies, incident investigations, periodic audits, and management of change reviews.  Teams with management, operator and contractor participation are responsible for the development of related programs and procedures.  Written policies reinforce the importance of employee participation and ensure process-related information is made available to those involved.  All employees actively participate in Penford's safety process.\n\n2.    Process Safety Information/Trade Secrets\n\nRecognizing the importance of developing and maintaining technical documentation, Penford has established documentation standards and developed a computer-based document control system.  When new or modified processes are developed, they are designed to meet or exceed all accepted trade and design standards.  Information from chemical suppliers, engineering and trade associations, regulatory agencies, and equipment suppliers is utilized to design processes.  Materials of construction, design specifications, safe operating limits, operating and maintenance procedures, chemical safety information, and other key information are collected or developed to ensure the process operates safely.  Maintenance, operating, emergency shutdown, and an emergency action plan are developed and maintained. Penford ensures that its processes are maintained within their process limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown and safety systems).\n\nProcess-related information is managed us"

A process safety information file index helps direct personnel to the appropriate documents.  Penford's access to information policy ensures process safety information is available to all personnel working in or affected by the process.\n\n3.    Process Hazard Analysis\n\nPenford utilizes team-based hazard analysis techniques to ensure all potential hazards are identified and multiple levels of protection are in place to prevent an incident.  Teams with engineers, operators, and mechanics and safety professionals evaluate each component and procedure of each process.  If new processes are developed, hazard evaluations are conducted at each phase of the design and construction.  Multiple hazard evaluation techniques including hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis and what-if/checklists are utilized.    \n\nTrained study leaders, computerized hazard analysis software, and written hazard study protocol ensure each study is effective.  Every change to a process is similarly evaluated, and each process is comprehensively re-evaluated at least every five years. Penford has established a system to ensure timely response to findings and recommendations.  The computer-based system ensures: recommendations are documented, actions prioritized, and responsibilities assigned; a written schedule for completing action is developed; action is taken and documented; and action is communicated to affected personnel. \n\n4.    Management of Change\n\nTo help ensure proposed changes to processes are properly evaluated before they are implemented, Penford has developed an effective management of change program.  All proposed changes are carefully evaluated by engineers, operators, safety professionals, and site management to ensure a change does not introduce an unforeseen hazard.  Changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other process changes are su"

Operating Procedures\n\nPenford maintains detailed written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  When process changes are made, the management of change process ensures affected procedures are updated and operators are re-trained.  Process control equipment and software have also been programmed to require compliance with operating procedures.  In addition, Penford's distributed control systems (DCS) which control the process equipment have been programmed with safety interlocks that run in parallel and oversee normal operations providing yet another layer of protection.  \n\n6.    Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures, Penford has developed a comprehensive training program for all of its employees and contractors.  New employees are required to complete a new hire orientation prior to assignment in the facility.  After successfully completing the new hire orientation, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  The new operator must demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner prior to working independently.
