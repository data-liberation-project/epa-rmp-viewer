These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will continue until the process is no longer operating.  The results of these updates are documented and retained.  Update findings are forwarded to management for consideration.  Final resolution of the findings is documented and retained onsite as part of the RMP.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe facility has developed and compiled a comprehensive set of operating procedures to provide instruction in the safe operation of facility processes.  Procedures provide a reliable and consistent reference for all phases of process operations. \n\nEach procedure contains procedure steps, operating parameters and limits, safety and health hazard information, safety control measures, and assignment of responsibility for performing the procedure.  Operating procedures are kept current through the management of change process.\n\nThe Plant Manager and Maintenance Manager bear responsibility for developing, reviewing, and approving operating procedures.  The Maintenance Manager is responsible for correctly implementing operating procedures.\n\nTraining\n\nTurner Holdings LLC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. All new employees receive basic safety training to comply with OSHA and USEPA regulations, as well as Turner Holdings LLC policies and procedures. All new employees that will also be working with the refrigeration system (i.e. ammonia maintenance mechanics) receive detailed safety training directly from the Maintenance Manager. Ammonia operators may work independently only after showing (e.g., through skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform job duties and tasks in a safe manner. Refresher training will be performed every year or three years, as required."

Where required, employees are tested to document participation and to confirm the employee understands the subject matter.  All training is documented and maintained onsite with the Human Resource Department.\n\nContractors\n\nTurner Holdings LLC has developed a Contractor Safety Program to satisfy PSM guidelines by extending plant safety requirements to non-employees working within the plant.  The Program is intended to maintain a plant-wide, consistent level of safe work performance.  The Maintenance Manager is responsible for enforcing the Contractor Safety Program, as follows: \n\n* Requires the contractor to verify each employee's knowledge of job safety, craft skills, and equipment operation before assignment to onsite work.\n* Establishes pre-job meetings, pre-job safety orientation conference, and site-specific orientation before actual work begins to ensure that the contractor and contract employees fully understand the safety policies and requirements of the plant.  \n* Assigns ultimate responsibility to contractors for their employees' safety.  Safety responsibility covers maintaining safe work conditions, control of unsafe acts, holding safety meetings, and accident investigation.\n* Requires periodic audits to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their responsibilities under OSHA 1910.119.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nTurner Holdings LLC conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) any time new equipment or modifications to existing equipment change the associated process safety information.  The review is intended to verify and document that all aspects of the equipment's design, construction and operation have been evaluated, and to certify that the equipment can be placed in operation.

The review addresses 1) design and construction, 2) maintenance and inspection, 3) procedures, and 4) training.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n1910.119 (j) requires employers to take specific measures to maintain ongoing integrity of process equipment.  These measures include following O&M guidelines for equipment maintenance and repair, training in maintenance activities, an inspection and testing program, safe and timely correction of equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance in fabrication, installation, and spare parts.  The Maintenance Department is responsible for the administration of the Mechanical Integrity Program.  The Integrity Program accomplishes the following:\n\n* Requires procedures that include a description of the organization, standards for the development of procedures, a description of quality assurance measures, a written description of employee and contract employee training, a description of document controls, and requirements for periodic compliance audits.\t\n* Sets general operation and maintenance training requirements for maintenance employees.\n* Sets guidelines for the conduct and documentation of process equipment inspection and testing. \n* Requires safe and timely correction of equipment deficiencies.\n* Assures integrity and quality in the suitability, installation, and maintenance of equipment.\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nTurner Holdings LLC has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include 1) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, and 2) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work).

The management of change (MOC) process is a system of checks and balances intended to ensure that each department involved in the planning, installation, and operation of the modified process has reviewed the change.  The process also ensures that all affected process safety information is updated to reflect the change, and that the safety of the modification has been evaluated before startup.  \n\nThe management of change process is initiated when an originator fills out an MOC form, which describes the change and provides justification for the project.  The MOC form identifies and documents the following:\n\n* The technical basis for the change\n* The impact of the change on safety and health\n* The necessary revisions to process safety information\n* Completion of a pre-startup safety review\n* Approval from the appropriate departments\n\nThe originator then secures approval from Plant Manager and Maintenance Manager to proceed with the project.
