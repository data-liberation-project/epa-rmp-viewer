In order to remove harmful pathogens from water before it is distributed, the plant chlorinates water in the final steps of treatment.   Three tons of chlorine are stored on site in the form of gas liquified by pressure.\n\nChlorine is a water-soluble, poisonous gas that is highly irritating to the respiratory organs.  At concentrations of 15 parts per million (ppm), chlorine is immediately irritating to humans by inhalation.  At concentrations of 50 ppm, chlorine is dangerous even for brief exposures, and exposures of 1,000 ppm may be fatal even if exposure is brief.  Long term damage from chlorine gas exposure includes changes in the trachea, bronchi, emphysema, and congestion in the respiratory system.  Short term effects include coughing, vomiting, headache, and chest pains.  However, the human olfactory sense can detect chlorine concentrations as low as 3.5 ppm, so extensive exposure rarely occurs.\n\n\n3.0 PURPOSE OF THE SUBMISSION\n\nThe RMP was initially prepared and submitted in June 1999 and was resubmitted in January 2005.  The purpose of this RMP submission is to comply with the 5-year re-submission requirement as imposed by the EPA.  New information that is required for this submission is also included in this RMP.\n\n4.0 ACCIDENT HISTORY & ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Radford Water Treatment Plant can certify that there have been no releases of chlorine in the past five years that have resulted in any off site impact.  The plant is proud of its accident-free history and has put into effect an extensive accidental release prevention program to m"

The most extensive of the three RMP programs, Program 3 includes a number of requirements that closely track OSHA PSM requirements.  Program 3 also focuses on the off-site consequences of an accidental release.  The prevention program outlines information and procedures regarding all aspects of safe operation, including process safety information, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), operating procedures, mechanical integrity, and personnel training.  \n\nThe PHA is designed to be conducted by a cross-section of facility employees, with guidance from employees directly involved in the chlorination process.  The PHA team identifies, evaluates, and implements controls associated with hazards in the chlorination process.  The overall purpose of the PHA is to comply with the PSM/RMProgram regulations and to prevent or minimize the effects of a chemical release.  The PHA team may conduct a new hazard analysis if significant modifications have been made to the current process or new regulated processes are added.  PHAs are, however, updated and revalidated a t least every five years after completion of initial PHAs.\n\nThe program also ensures that the plant maintains up-to-date, accurate, written Operating Procedures that provide clear instructions for all covered processes.  Effective operating procedures, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in guaranteeing safe operation of the systems and preventing accidental releases.\n\nThe mechanical integrity program is integral in preventing accidental chemical releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment.  This program outlines equipment maintenance, including maintenance, testing, and inspection schedules and procedures, maintenance personnel training, correction of equipment deficiencies, "

All personnel currently working at the plant have been certified as having all of the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to conduct their jobs safely and efficiently.  In addition, the plant will train and certify new personnel and will conduct mandatory refresher courses for all personnel.  \n\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Radford Water Treatment Plant is included in the city of Radford Community Emergency Response Plan, and is therefore not required to develop a facility Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  Nontheless, the Radford Water Treatment Plant has voluntarily developed an ERP that includes a)  guidance for responding to an emergency in the Safety and Training manual located in the control building and the water treatment plant laboratory, b)  coordination with community emergency response organizations, and c)  the establishment of a First Response Team.  The First Response Team is comprised of operators and maintenance staff from the water and wastewater treatment plants who are trained to safely contain and repair an emergency chlorine leak.  The plant conducts awareness-level emergency response training of all personnel on-site.  In addition, all personnel who are emergency response team members receive responder-level training, depending on their assigned duties and responsibilities in an emergency.\n\nCommunity responder organizations who will assist in major incidents will be provided with a copy of the ERP and subsequent updates.  TheRadford Emergency Services Coordinator will arrange for one meeting, drill, or exercise each year with these local organizations to promote preparedness for effective response in the event of an incident.

Yearly training is provided on personal protection equipment."
