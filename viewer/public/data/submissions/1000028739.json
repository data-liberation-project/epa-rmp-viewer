      "SummaryText": "The Aqua Ohio Inc. Tiffin Plant is a water treatment plant that provides drinking water to customers in the area of Tiffin, Ohio.  To ensure that our water remains safe throughout the distribution system and it's taps, the plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent.  The concentrated form of chlorine is liquified and stored in shipping containers.  Before it is mixed with water, chloine can be extremely hazardous if released into the air.\r\n\r\nAqua Ohio Inc. is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any release of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous material releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through emergency management agencies.\r\n\r\nAqua Ohio Inc. has completed an offsite consequence analysis including a worst-case scenario.  As required by the EPA RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel or container as a gas in ten minutes.  The regulations require assuming worst-case wind speed and atmospheric conditions that result in the greatest projected impact distance.\r\n\r\nFor the offsite consequences analysis, the endpoint concentration is defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) values developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  AIHA defines the ERPG-2 value as, the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The endpoint (ERPG-2) established for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm.\r\n\r\nFor"

EPA RMP COMP offsite consequence analysis software was used to estimate distances for offsite impacts.\r\n\r\nA major release of the magnitude represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the robust design of chlorine transport containers as they are designed to withstand transportation mishaps and also the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs in place at chlorine suppliers and the Tiffin plant.  In fact, release reporting databases and water industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nBoth the worst-case scenario and alternative release scenario are only estimates and may vary depending on actual terrain and weather conditions.\r\n\r\nTo ensure a worst-case scenario or alternative release scenario does not occur, the Tiffin plant maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine.  The prevention program has twelve elements designed to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\r\n\r\nOur prevention measures include the use of:\r\n  *chlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems\r\n  *process safety information to document the safe process design\r\n  *process hazards analysis to evaluate the chemical and process hazards\r\n  *operating procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely\r\n  *maintenance, inspection, and testing to ensure that the system is maintained according to applicable standards and manufacturer's recommendations\r\n  *trai"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major chlorine release.\r\n\r\nIn the event that a chlorine releases does occur, the Tiffin plant has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the regional emergency management agency and the local emergency planning committee.  If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the local emergency resonders who would dispatch a trained HAZMAT team to the site to handle the chlorine release.\r\n\r\nWe continually work to safely manage the hazards of chlorine to protect our employess and community that we serve.  The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment, and follow safe work practices.  Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analysis, and coordinate with the community emergency response organization.  We also will be continually assessing further safety enhancements to the facility as they become available."
