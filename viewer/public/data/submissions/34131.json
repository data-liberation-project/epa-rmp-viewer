(Winn-Dixie) requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Winn-Dixie\u00bfs corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.  \n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\nThe Dairy and Distribution Center, owned and operated by Winn-Dixie Logistics, Inc., are located at 3925 Highway 190 West in Hammond, Louisiana.  The Dairy facility manufactures milk, juice, and bottled water for distribution to the Winn-Dixie Supermarkets. The Distribution Center consists of areas for dry, cooler, and freezer storage of perishable and non-perishable items for distribution to the Winn-Dixie Supermarkets.\n\nThe Dairy has an ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 pound RMP threshold quantity. The majority of the process equipment, including the High Pressure receiver (HPR) is located inside the building.\n\nThe Distribution Center has two separate ammonia refrigeration systems which exceed the 10,000 pound RMP threshold quantity.  The HPRs are both located inside machine rooms.   \n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nAll three processes exceed the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and are therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places them in RMP program 3 level.  Winn-Dixie uses its PSM program as the required program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nWinn-Dixie has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all"

This ensures that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, Winn-Dixie also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include operation of safety devices.  These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout, Confined Space Entry, and Hot Work Permit are reviewed and updated when necessary to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Winn-Dixie refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff also performed a PHA of each of these processes.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Auditing, and Incident Investigation are also part of the programs to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Programs receive full support of facility management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Five-year accide"

Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Hammond facility has an Integrated Contingency Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38 and paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120, including onsite emergency response capability.  In the event of an emergency, evacuation procedures are initiated and the Winn-Dixie Hazardous Materials Response Team handles releases.  The local Fire Department and its Hazardous Materials Response Team will be notified for back-up.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Louisiana State Warning Point at 1-(504) 925-6595.\n\n6.\tPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nNo changes are specifically identified but regular training sessions and compliance audits will be conducted.  If shortfalls are noted in the compliance audits then an action plan will be developed and areas of improvement will be addressed in a timely manner."
