(SPI) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their facility in Chester, South Carolina.  SPI is a chemical manufacturing facility.  Operations include the manufacture of polymer resins and emulsions.  SPI has been producing quality products at their main facility in Oregon for over 27 years and provides over 50 jobs to the local community.  The plant in South Carolina was constructed with \"safety\" as a primary goal, using state-of-the-art equipment.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nSPI is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is SPI policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120), OSHA's Emergency Plans and Fire Protection Plans (29 CFR 1910.38), and OSHA's Hazard Communication regulations (29 CFR 1910.1200).\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nAt SPI, vinyl acetate monomer (CAS 108-05-4) is reacted to produce a product for industrial distribution.  SPI's system consisting of two (2) bulk storage tanks, a reactor vessel, and associated piping can contain a quantity of vinyl acetate in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold given in Appendix A of 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of vinyl acetate monomer, SPI has implemented several precautionary measures.  SPI has developed and will implement an Emergency Action Plan and a Hazardous Materials Contingency Plan.  SPI has also complied with EPA's 112r General Duty clause.  As such, the vinyl acetate system has been evaluated for release potential.  Some of the c"

SPI encourages employee participation in the development of the control measures used at the plant.  Employees have the opportunity to voice opinions, concerns, questions, or ideas during the monthly training sessions or during the quarterly safety meetings.  For topics that require more immediate attention, SPI employees may approach their supervisor directly or place suggestions in the suggestion box.\n\n\n\nSPI understands that maintaining the system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases.  As such, SPI will conduct preventive maintenance on the process equipment on a monthly basis.  The preventive maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.\n\n\n\nTo confirm that control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits will be performed on the vinyl acetate system.  SPI conducts compliance audits every three years.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Chester facility began operations during January 2000 and has not experienced an accidental release of vinyl acetate monomer.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nSPI has documented emergency response procedures in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an offsite release of vinyl acetate.  Included in the emergency response program are measures to be taken internally by SPI employees and procedures to inform local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nTo assure that the local municipal response agencies are famili"

Chester County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) will review SPI's emergency response procedures.  In the event of a vinyl acetate release resulting in offsite consequences, the general public will be notified by the Chester County LEPC.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSPI has implemented a continuous training program to improve safety awareness."
