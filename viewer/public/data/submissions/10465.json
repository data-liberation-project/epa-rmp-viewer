Messer GmbH has developed Safety, Health, and Environmental guidelines. These guidelines have been further refined and developed into a comprehensive program defined as Loss Prevention Policies (LPP) and are contained in this manual. These policies are the minimal standards for Messer America's (Central, North, South America and AGS) operations.\n\n The objective of this program is to achieve an acceptable level of performance in the prevention of losses to the organization, which include but are not limited to; accidents, injuries, illnesses, product liabilities, regulatory non-conformities, etc. To be effective, this management system must be totally integrated in which all levels of employment are involved and held accountable. \n\nThe ultimate authority for instituting an effective Loss Prevention Program rests with the senior management of each operating Group. Through their words and more importantly through their actions, senior management sets the tone for loss prevention throughout Messer Americas. While senior management sets the tone, middle management must create the uniform support and nurture the desired culture to influence the Loss Prevention program. This strong management commitment culminates with the day to day responsibility of implementing and managing the Loss Prevention program by line management (supervisor and lead personnel). Local management is accountable for the effective management of this program through their organization"

      "SummaryText": "'s performance as related to loss prevention and regulatory compliance (which includes company policies).\n\nIn a healthy loss prevention culture, each member of the company participates fully in the program. Loss prevention is no longer an activity that someone else is in charge of. Each manager, supervisor, driver, and line worker is personally responsible for insuring safe working conditions, safe product for all customers and a safe environment for the citizens of the communities in which Messer operates.\n\n\nSIMPLIFIED PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe MG Industries West Lake facility is an air separation manufacturing plant.  The natural gas portion of the plant process falls within the RMP requirements.  Air is filtered and compressed in a centrifugal compressor to 90 psig.  After compression, heat is removed from the air with the aid of a cooling medium.  The process air is subsequently passed through a vessel containing molecular sieve material to remove carbon dioxide and water.  There are multiple vessels that are automatically sequenced that facilitates regeneration of sieve material with the use of dry nitrogen/air by-products gas.  Throughout each step of production the process air is analyzed for impurities, and monitored for control limits, thereby maintaining product quality standards.  The next stage of production involves cryogenic separation and purification.  After leaving the compression/filtration stage, the process air enters a network of heat exchangers and distillation columns, housed in an insulated structure.  Initially heat must be removed from the incoming process air.  This is accomplished via a mult-pass counter current heat exchanger designed to bring the air temperature down to cryogenic conditions, by way of passing outgoing gaseous products through adjacent heat exchanger fins.  The cold air now enters a double rectification column due to pressure and temperature differences between the components of air.  The separation process begins to oc"

      "SummaryText": "cur.  Oxygen and Nitrogen are circulated through both distillation columns which contain perforated trays stacked horizontally within the column.  As the molecules filter through these trays, they become purer and concentrate at different levels in the column.  Process control is accomplished through a series of detection points.  Each component of air can be withdrawn at various standards of purity throughout the column.\n\nThe final step in this process involves liquefaction of the separated gases.  Inside the rectification column, a portion of pure gaseous nitrogen is continuously withdrawn and sent to an externally located liquefier section.  This gaseous nitrogen is routed through several loops before arriving at its final destination, as liquid back into the distillation column.  The first loop sends gaseous nitrogen through a series of heat exchangers and compression equipment in order to provide a heat balance and volume to the system.  The second loop draws a portion of compressed nitrogen and feeds this stream to an expansion turbine to achieve cryogenic temperatures in the liquifier section.  The remaining unexpanded gas is liquefied by heat exchange with a turbine discharge streams and expanded back into the rectification column.  This liquid nitrogen entering the column provides sufficient cooling to liquify the remaining gases.  As liquid level are established and purity analysis is taken, quantities of liquid oxygen and nitrogen can be withdrawn for storage.\n\nThe aforementioned part of the process that involves a RMP regulated substance is the regeneration of the mole sieve material.  Natural gas (methane) is used as a fuel to heat the regeneration gas for the vessel.  The methane exists in quantities large enough for RMP submission.  The safety-related equipment/devices are described later in this summary report.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe first step in the worst-case release analysis was to determine the total amount of natural gas onsite.

While there are safety devices and process controls on the equipment to prevent accidental releases, a large natural disturbance such as a tornado could rip through the facility and create a worst-case release of all of the natural gas.  The determination of the affected distance to endpoint was made using the RMP*Comp software.  The distance to endpoint was found to be 0.3 miles.  The Landview III software package was used to determine the general environmental and community impact within this radius.  There are approximately 60 people living within this radius.  There is also one other business in the immediate area. There are no environmental receptors in the endpoint radius area.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe best alternative scenario that could be developed that would have an offsite impact was modeling rupture in a 1 safety relief valve header resulting in natural gas escaping.  A ten-minute time period was used for the release calculations.  This is an estimate on the maximum amount of time required to close the upstream valve manually.  The amount of natural gas released was calculated at 615 pounds using the RMP*Comp software.  The distance to endpoint was found to be 0.1 miles.  The Landview III software package was used to determine the general environmental and community impact within this radius.  There are approximately 3 people living within this radius.
