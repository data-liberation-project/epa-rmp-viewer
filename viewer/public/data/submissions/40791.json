      "SummaryText": "As a producer of Sulfur Dioxide, Calabrian Corporation has developed and implemented a Risk Management Program in compliance with accidental release prevention regulations of the Clean Air Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, and OSHA's Process Saftey Management Standards.\n\nThe Calabrian Risk Management Plan (RMP) includes Hazard Assessments for the offsite consequences of releases under Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios. Also included in the RMP are programs for the prevention of accidental releases and worker safety which reflect the key elements of OSHA's PSM requirements deemed essential for safe management of hazardous substances.\n\nCalabrian's Hazard Assesment Program has identified theoretical Worst-Case Scenarios (WCS) for release of the largest quantities of regulated substances that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint as defined by the United States Evnironmental Protection Agency. WCS for Sulfur Dioxide are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure, assume the quantity of a 90-ton railcar is released as a gas over 10 minutes. The distance to endpoint is 16 miles including an estimated population of 300,000 individuals.\n\nHazard Assessments of alternative Release Scenarios (ARS), which are more likely to occur than the theoretical WCS , indentified a hole in the liquid space of a tank with a distance to endpoint of 0.7 miles. Population within this distance to endpoint is 1,361 individuals.\n\nAdministrative controls as well as passive and active migration measures were considered in the Hazard Assesment. These include dikes, berms, scrubbers, and neutralization, and emergency shutdown systems. Additionally, Calabrian's accidental release prevention program for Sulfur Dioxide include accepted techniques for developing process safety information and conducting process hazard analyses. All OSHA Process Safety Management and RMP programs have been implemented. Process controls for thi"

Calabrian did not have any reportable releases in this time period.\n\nCalabrian's written Emergency Response Plane is coordinated with the community emergency response network and includes action to be taken in response to accidental releasees of the regulated substance. These plans include procedures for informing local agencies responding to accidental releases, the public, and local medical community as well as information on emergency health care. Training for site workers is conducted annually with information provided to municipal responders and local emergency planning committies."
