The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Farmers Coop Mill and Elevator are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\n  a.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to \n\n      farmers.\n\n  b.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for \n\n      crop production nutrients.\n\n            \n\n  c.  The maximum quantity stored would be 210,120 pounds in our 30,000 gallon tank and our 18,000 gallon tank, or 210,000\n\n      pounds combined. Due to the round requirements of the RMP Submit Program, the 210,120 pounds is rounded to 210,000 pounds\n\n\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program\n\n\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,\n\n    Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety \n\n    and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\n\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years \n\n   that:\n\n\n\n    Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n    To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering \n\n    in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.
