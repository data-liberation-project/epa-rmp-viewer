The manufacturing plant currently houses both the administrative offices and the plant manufacturing operations. \n\n\n\nA 30,000 gallon liquefied petroleum LP gas tank is located off the southwest corner of the manufacturing plant. LP gas (propane/butane mixture) is used at the facility as a propellant for aerosol paints. LP gas is a regulated flammable RMP substance with a threshold quantity for accidental release prevention of 10,000 pounds. The amount of LP gas present in the system is approximately 133,580 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe LP gas handled at the plant is operated and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58: Standard for Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases, as well as equipment manufacturer operation and maintenance requirements and recommendations and with appropriate and applicable industry standards and practices. \n\n\n\nRust-Oleum's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local regulations is demonstrated through its comprehensive prevention program for all critical process systems addressing design, installation, operating and maintenance procedures and schedules, and employee and contractor training and certification. \n\n\n\nIn the event that an emergency incident were to occur at the Hagerstown Plant, response protocols have been developed and coordinated with offsite responders, including the Williamsport Fire Department and the Williamsport Police Department.\n\n\n\nRegistration\n\n\n\nThe plant is located at 16410 Industrial Lane, Williamsport, Washington County, Maryland 21795.
