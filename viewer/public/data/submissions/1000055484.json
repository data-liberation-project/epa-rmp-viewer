Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nFlexitank, Inc. is a privately held logistics company, located in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes related to bulk chemical transportation and storage in a safe and responsible manner in compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. Flexitank has implemented a safety and security program in which training to personnel in the operation, hazardous materials handling and warehouse safety is included. All Flexitank employees are informed of hazards in the workplace, are trained accordingly and have procedures in place on the facility in the unlikely event that hazardous substance releases were to occur, which activates emergency notification and response procedures to ensure the safety of our employees, the community, the environment and property. \r\n\r\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nFlexitank is an NVOCC (OTI) that specializes in logistics management. We occasionally store ISO-tanks containing chemical products for our customers as an added value service in our Depot Facilities located on the Zona Portuaria in San Juan. \r\n\r\nFlexitank Depot receives the bulk liquid cargo by the following modes of transportation: tank trucks, ISO tank containers and flexi-bags (no hazardous products only). The received cargo is stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and it is subsequently dispatch on the same transportation modes as originally received. Flexitank, Inc. does not perform any chemical processing, manufacturing or product transfer to intermediate storage containers. \r\n\r\nThe following Regulated Toxic Substances are occasionally stored at Flexitank, Depot facilities and have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: \r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS Number 7664"

Prevention Program\r\n\r\nActions to prevent the recurrence or spread of fires, explosions or releases include stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing released material, and recovering or isolating containers. In addition, if the facility stops operations in response to an emergency, the Emergency Coordinator will monitor valves, pipes and other equipment for leaks, pressure build up, gas generation or ruptures.\r\n\r\nThe information contained in this program has been prepared in accordance with the requirements for a Prevention, Preparedness and Contingency Plan as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 265.50 through 265.56, as well as any applicable Commonwealth of Puerto Rico laws, rules and regulations. Also, elements of Emergency Response Plans (in accordance to EPCRA requirements), and of Risk Management Plans (40 CFR 63) have been incorporated to minimize hazards to human health or the environment resulting from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials or any of its constituents to the air, soil or surface water.\r\n\r\nThe hazardous materials storage facilities are inspected on a weekly basis.
