This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process solution equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nAlbertsons - Irvine senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  Albertsons has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nAlbertsons - Irvine was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations in place at the time of construction.  The facility is located at 9300 Toledo Way in Irvine, California.  The facility is approximately 1.5 miles northeast of the Interstate 5 and approximately 3 miles Southeast of State Route 133.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas.

The produce warehouse uses 17,800 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system, which operates continuously.  Likewise, the freezer warehouse uses 35,600 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system, which operates continuously. Compressors and condenser cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  Cold storage and dock areas use evaporators to maintain room temperatures.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage and dock areas.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions for the produce ammonia system range from 28 psig on the low-pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side. Typical operating conditions for the Freezer ammonia system range from 3\" Hg on the low-pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side. \n\n\n\nThe majority of the ammonia refrigeration equipment is located inside the respective engine room. The condensers are mounted on the respective engine room roof and the evaporators are placed in their respective dock or storage areas.  Access to the engine room is limited to authorized personnel.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards inc"

The PSM prevention programs included developing written operating and maintenance procedures as well as other policies and programs to manage the handling of ammonia at the facility (Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Employee Training, and Participation, etc.). \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow facility personnel to monitor system operations.

The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history reveals that there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (June 2011 - June 2016).  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation. NOTE that the Freezer Warehouse is new in August 2016; therefore there is no accident history to report for that process.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency action plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility:\n\n\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n\n  2.)
