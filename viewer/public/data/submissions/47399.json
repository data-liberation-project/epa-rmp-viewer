      "SummaryText": "James Valley Ethanol will operate an ethanol fuel production plant located Groton, in Brown County, South Dakota.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112\u00ae Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, James Valley Ethanol completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.  This information is considered to be public knowledge and can be accessed through the Environmental Protection Agency website at  http://www.epa.gov/enviro/index_java.html.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nJames Valley Ethanol is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.  The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of James Valley Ethanol to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of denaturant (natural gasoline), it is the policy of James Valley Ethanol to notify the Groton Police & Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain approximately 40 percent pentane (we use 60% for roporting), an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 380,400 pounds (total pentane is 228,240 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank far"

      "SummaryText": "m area which includes secondary containment.\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario defined by RMP Guidance is a release of the full contents of the tank in 10 minutes time during the most stable atmospheric conditions, which would be a very unrealistic scenario.  This scenario would be a failure of the natural gasoline (pentane) storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to RMP*Comp, a software tool developed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for use in performing off-site consequence analysis, the maximum estimated distance from the facility's center to a one pound per square inch overpressure is 0.50 miles.  There are no public human receptors within the 0.50-mile radius of the plant, but we use 5 for unseen circumstances.  The analysis assumed a release of 228,240 pounds of denaturant (the entire contents of the tank), a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and an air temperature of 77 degrees F.  This was an overly conservative approach in assuming there are not mitigating measures in place.       \n\nAlternative Case Releases\n\nAlternative case scenarios are a more realistic approach to any potential accidental release at the facility due to the fact that mitigating equipment and employee response, if applicable, is taken into account.  The alternative case scenario evaluated using RMP Guidance was a failure of the largest natural gasoline storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  According to RMP*Comp, the maximum estimated distance from the facility's center to the Lower Flammability Limit for pentane (1.4%) is less than 0.1 mile. The estimated number of human receptors within a 0.1 mile radius of the tank only includes plant personnel and no public receptors.  The analysis assumed a release of 6,570 pounds pentane, a wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour, and an air temperature of 77 degrees F.  The analysis also assumed the release occurs in a diked area since the James Valley Ethanol tank farm is located in a"
