Badger Filtration Plant senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The Safety Coordinator administers the Plant's safety and environmental policies. The Safety Coordinator is responsible for various inspections of the Plant's facilities to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe R.E. Badger Filtration Plant is located at 18535 Aliso Canyon Road, Rancho Santa Fe, California  92067.  R.E. Badger Filtration Plant's initial start-up occurred in 1970.  The chlorine feed system consists of twenty-four one-ton containers which are the storage vessels for chlorine.  A maximum of three tanks are connected on line on each manifold where two manifolds are present.  Chlorine gas is first drawn from a container through vacuum regulator to the manifold.  Under vacuum, it is drawn through chlorinators to injectors where it is mixed with water for distribution throughout the treatment plant.  \n\nChlorine and Aqueous Ammonia are the only regulated substances on site.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine on site is 48,000 pounds.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of aqueous ammonia on site is 5,500 gallons.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nR.E. Badger Filtration Plant has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  Practices and procedures for proper chlorine handling were obtained from the Chlorine Institute Manual for the Safety Handling of Chlorin"

      "SummaryText": "e. In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system tied to a chlorine sensor that is activated if the concentration of chlorine exceeds 3 ppm.  Visual and audible alarms are activated to alert personnel of the release.  Procedures are in place for operators to respond to a release.\n\nAll operators are trained prior to working alone.  The aqueous ammonia storage tank is situated in the chemical tank farm containment area with a sump.  There is a high level switch in the sump that activates a sump pump in the even a liquid level is detected in the sump area.  An alarm is sent to the Master Control Board.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince the initial technical study (January 1999 - January 2004), there have been no releases of chlorine or aqueous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity or the California threshold of any release at either Plant. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, the R.E. Badger Filtration Plant?s response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  It is reviewed annually to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nR.E. Badger Filtration Plant has taken a pro-active approach to emergency response and safety at the Water Treatment Plants.  The annual emergency response drills are documented and mitigation measures to improve the Team?s response are continuously being reviewed. R.E. Badger Filtration Plant has implement"

These changes include the following items:\n\n1.    Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.    Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.    Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.    Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
