      "SummaryText": "Algona has a release prevention and emergency response policy at our facility.  This facility complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  This facility is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.   If any emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Gerald Zwiefel who is employed by West Bend Elevator.  Gerald will then decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed which is137,700 pounds.  This would cause the anhydrous to become liquefied under pressure.  If this were to occur the release rate would be 13,770 pounds per minute and duration of the release would be approximately 10 minutes.   According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.  There are an estimated 7,000 people within this radius. Our alternative case scenario is a transfer hose failure.  This hose failure would result in a quantity release of 5,594 pounds of anhydrous each minute for a period of 2 minutes.  According to EPA lookup tables the distance to the toxic endpoint is .5 miles.  Within the radius of either scenario are schools, residences, hospitals, prison/correction facilities, recreation areas, and major commercial, office or industrial areas.  Algona has 1 bullet tank and 34 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia at their location.  It is this facility's intention to comply with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  West Bend Elevator holds training sessions regularly to train new employees and review procedures with other employees followed by an exam.  Hoses, valves, and vents are inspected on a regular basis for any problems.  Receiving ports include one-way valves to protect from product discharged during r"

      "SummaryText": "eceiving.  Also within the past year we have installed steel barricades 8 feet apart around the perimeter of the bullet tanks.  These steel barricades were sunk to a depth of 4 feet below ground level and cemented for strength.  These steel barricades protrude 3 1/2 feet above ground level.  This should minimize vehicle contact with bullet tanks at the storage facility.  The bullet tanks are locked when the plant facility is closed to deter vandalism or accidental discharge of ammonia at the plant.  The anhydrous ammonia plant was designed, installed, and is maintained with state laws and regulations in mind.   We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Algona Fire Dept and request they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Kossuth County Disaster Coordinator, Algona Fire Dept Chief and members.  The Algona fire department has inspected our NH3 facility.  We have no plans at this time to improve or change our plans except for the following. We are currently investigating the use of locking devices on nurse wagons to prevent or deter the theft of ammonia for meth labs.   We review the plans annually or sooner if necessary."
