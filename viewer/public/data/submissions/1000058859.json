The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Zotos International, Incorporated manufactures a variety of aerosol products.  Based on predictive filing, there could be as many as 14 substances and mixtures used in the aerosol process.  These substances include Butane, Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-], Isopentane, Dimethylether, Propane,and Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl].   Butane is used for aerosol propellant.  Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used for aerosol propellant.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for aerosol propellant. Isopentane is used for aerosol propellant.  Propane is used for aerosol propellant.  Dimethylether is used for aerosol propellant.  \n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 2004 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nZotos International, Incorporated maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equi"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA was performed in August 2013.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Zotos International, Incorporated  maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nZotos International, Incorporated has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nZotos International, Incorporated  carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
