Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s operations include the processing of meat products (hot dogs, sausages, hams and deli meats) for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand names of Hillshire Farm and Deli Select.  Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s has been in operation at this facility for over 50 years providing quality meat products and over 1000 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn?s is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and maintain compliance with safety, health, and environmental regulations: 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn?s is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 500,000 ft2 facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants.  Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s refrigeration system consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators,"

Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s worst case release scenario would be the rupture of the largest single receiver when filled to 80% capacity (the maximum tank capacity limited by engineering controls) over a 10-minute period.  Using the EPA?s RMP*Comp program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.2 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.  During normal operations, Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s maintains the receivers at 40% capacity.  Only during pump-down operations do the receivers have the potential to be filled to 80% of capacity.  The receivers are operated in pump-down mode only when there is an emergency in the plant.  The system has operated in pump-down mode twice in it?s history.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s taking into consideration the 50-year history of operation?s experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted to ensure that Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s hazards are identified and minimized.  These analyses were conducted under the Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).  The most likely release scenario identified by Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s would be a release caused by a faulty piping valve located on the roof of the plant.

Using EPA?s RMP*Comp program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.80 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, And Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s has implemented several precautionary measures, such as process/equipment controls, standard operating procedures, preventative maintenance programs, employee training and audit programs.  \n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn?s maintains a ?no odor? policy.  The ?no odor? policy instructs employees that detect an ammonia odor to call the Utilities Maintenance staff and the Utilities Maintenance staff must respond immediately to the call to address the situation.\n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn?s has implemented and is in compliance with OSHA?s PSM regulations and as such, has evaluated and engineered for anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s has trained approximately 37 personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat team).\n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn?s has developed standard operating procedures (SOP) for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an annual basis by means of a SOP review session.

The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the refrigeration system.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components, auditing is conducted every 5 years by a certified refrigeration contractor.\n\nTo ensure that Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n? In accordance with the PSM program, Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years that incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n?

Included in the ERSPCC are measures to be taken internally by Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn?s has trained approximately 37 on-site personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  These personnel receive initial training and annual update training thereafter. Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s stages mock release incidents regularly to test the skills of the HazMat team.\n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s emergency response procedures, Hillshire Farm and Kahn?s has submitted copies of the ERSPCC for review and approval by the local agencies.
