Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs operations include the processing of meat products (hot dogs, sausages, hams and deli meats) for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand names of Hillshire Farm and Deli Select.  Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs has been in operation at this facility for over 50 years providing quality meat products and over 1000 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and maintain compliance with safety, health, and environmental regulations: 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA\u00bfs Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 500,000 ft2 facility within the required range of operating temperatures.

Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs worst case release scenario would be the rupture of the largest single receiver when filled to 80% capacity (the maximum tank capacity limited by engineering controls) over a 10-minute period.  Using the EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.2 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.  During normal operations, Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs maintains the receivers at 40% capacity.  Only during pump-down operations do the receivers have the potential to be filled to 80% of capacity.  The receivers are operated in pump-down mode only when there is an emergency in the plant.  The system has operated in pump-down mode twice in it\u00bfs history.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs taking into consideration the 50-year history of operation\u00bfs experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted to ensure that Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs hazards are identified and minimized.  These analyses were conducted under the Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).  The most likely release scenario identified by Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs would be a release caused by a faulty piping valve located on the roof of the plant.

To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs has implemented several precautionary measures, such as process/equipment controls, standard operating procedures, preventative maintenance programs, employee training and audit programs.  \n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs maintains a \u00bfno odor\u00bf policy.  The \u00bfno odor\u00bf policy instructs employees that detect an ammonia odor to call the Utilities Maintenance staff and the Utilities Maintenance staff must respond immediately to the call to address the situation.\n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs has implemented and is in compliance with OSHA\u00bfs PSM regulations and as such, has evaluated and engineered for anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs has trained approximately 37 personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat team).\n\nHillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs has developed standard operating procedures (SOP) for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an annual basis by means of a SOP review session.

The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the refrigeration system.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components, auditing is conducted every 5 years by a certified refrigeration contractor.\n\nTo ensure that Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\u00b7 In accordance with the PSM program, Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years that incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\u00b7 In addition, Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs will implement auditing by the local fire department or Department of Commerce on an annual basis\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years, Hillshire Farm and Kahn\u00bfs has not experienced an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia causing any on-site death, injury or significant property damage, or known off-site death, injury, property"
