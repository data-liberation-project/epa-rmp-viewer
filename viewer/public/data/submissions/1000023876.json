      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Univar USA Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers process design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is located at 1804 N 20th Street, Nampa, Idaho.  The primary activity at this facility is warehousing of raw chemical products.  We have 2 Regulated Substances (RSs) as defined by the federal Envioronmental Protection Agency (EPA) present at this facility.  These RSs are Hydrochloric Acid (Hydrogen chloride) and Ammonia (Aqueous).  All substances are warehoused for the purpose of resale.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrochloric acid (Hydrogen chloride) at our facility is 533.00 lbs. while Ammonia (aqueous) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 1,826.00 lbs. \n\n\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), \nincluding administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP*Comp\u00c2\u00bf.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from warehousing.  In this scenario, 410 lbs. of Aqua Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 60 minutes."

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\n\nUnivar USA Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no RMP regulated substances released above the threshold quantities in the past 5 years at this facility.\n\n\n6.\tEmergency Contingency Plan\n\nUnivar USA Inc. carries a written Emergency Contingency Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The Plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first-aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the Plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent process changes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Additional training for spill response and personal protective equipment are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented by September 2009."
