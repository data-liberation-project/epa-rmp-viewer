The process units operated by Enterprise involve the processing of liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) into their individual components such as ethane, propane, propylene, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The primary separation process utilized is fractionation by distillation.  Supplemental fired heat recovery units provide heat energy to the processes via a heat medium system.  A gas turbine is utilized to drive a refrigeration compressor while recovering the heated exhaust gases in one of the fired heat recovery units.  The facility utilizes an air assisted flare for any and all venting of the processes.  The plant has an ethanolamine based treating unit for the removal of Carbon Dioxide from the natural gas liquids.  Solid desiccant dehydration units are also part of the process to remove water from the natural gas liquid streams.  \n\nThe fractionated hydrocarbon products listed above are flammable substances regulated under the RMP regulation.  As noted earlier, the Port Allen Plant has two different processes on site.  Both the Fractionation Process and the Propylene Concentration Process are registered as RMP Program 3 processes.  The purpose of the RMP is to provide information about our operations, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case of an accidental release, our five-year accident history and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nThe operations at the Port Allen Plant were reviewed to determine the toxic and flammable hazardous materials that are present on site that are covered by the EPA Risk Management Program.   These hazardous materials are as follows:\n\nToxics\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\nFlammables\n\nListed flammable substances which are handled or stored above the threshold quantities at the Port Allen Plant are raw make (Y-Grade Produ"

The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and has two Program Level 3 processes under the EPA RMP regulation.  \n\n Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Port Allen Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 3), and are also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage and the EPA RMP Program 3 processes.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.

Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (SDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Port Allen Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal s"

Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Port Allen Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Port Allen Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit of the program to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Port Allen Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Port Allen Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Port Allen Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n \n\nRelease"

The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Port Allen Plant is coordinated with the West Baton Rouge Parish Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.
