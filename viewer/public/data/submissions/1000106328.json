EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSaputo - Plant City developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo's Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Specific employees are trained and certified as medical responders. Employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is routinely updated to reflect pertinent changes. The plant also coordinates with the Hillsborough County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate \u2013 Department of Refrigeration Services, Health & Safety, Risk Group and Department of Environmental affairs will improve compliance and overall plant safety."
