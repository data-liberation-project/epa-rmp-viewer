The facility's senior management is committed to offer superior service while maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  \n\nVVWRA maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  An Emergency Response Plan is also in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP program maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nVVWRA has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Victorville Fire Department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of VVWRA to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nVictor Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority is located at 20111 Shay Road, Victorville, California 92394.  The facility is located approximately 5 miles northwest of Interstate 15, and 2 miles north of George Air Force Base.  The area surrounding the facility is primarily barren desert.  The chlorine system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is surrounded by chain link fence with access through one gate only.\n\nChlorine at the"

      "SummaryText": " treatment plant is received and stored in one-ton containers.  A maximum of fifteen containers can be stored at any one time.  The chlorine system has a manifold system that allows the system to draw gaseous chlorine from one of six on-line containers (each with a vacuum regulator).  Chlorine gas is routed to the chlorinators, where the feed rate is controlled.  A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the injectors, which pull the gaseous chlorine into the water supply, thus treating the wastewater.  The chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  This implies that a breach in the integrity of the system would result in air being sucked into the system, not a release of chlorine.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe VVWRA chlorine system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the VVWRA treatment plant operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's Risk Management Program and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nChlorine gas detectors are strategically located in the chlorine building (in the storage room and the chlorinator room).  In case of chlorine detection, visible and audible alarms are activated at the site and the on-call operator is paged through the SCADA system.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, vacuum regulators and check valves prevent chlorine from escaping the system.  If vacuum conditions are compromised, the vacuum regulators close stopping chlorine flow from the one-ton containers.  Chlorine vent lines are piped to water containers located outside the building.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Vict"

The facility's accident history was investigated as a result of updating the Hazard Assessment study (May 2004).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nVVWRA has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.

The PHA was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the chlorine system since the 1999 PHA, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the 1999 PHA, 1999 Seismic and 2002 PSM/RMP audit, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, and the review of chlorine checklists.
