Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Willacy Co-op in San Perlita, Texas are strongly committed to employee, public, and\n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\n\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\n\nresponse efforts with the Raymondville Fire Department, which provides additional emergency\n\nresponse expertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in one 12,000-gallon tank, two 6,000-gallon tanks, and two 1,000-gallon nurse tanks\n\nat our facility in San Perlita, Texas (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 22,100 gallons (\n\n113,726.6 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage\n\nvessel at our facility contains 52,489.2 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\n\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \n\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (52,489.2 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\n\nperiod.  We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect th"
