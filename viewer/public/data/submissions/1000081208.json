Ammonia is one of the ten hazardous chemicals most commonly involved in a release. To prevent and mitigate an Ammonia release, to improve facility safety, and benefit the community and the environment, Shamrock Foods Company has developed policies and programs to prevent an accidental release.  They include management commitment to safety, risk management plans, standard operating procedures, safety programs, preventative maintenance programs, contractor safety, and training. The most common causes of an Ammonia release are related to Operations and Maintenance failures, Equipment Failures and/or Process Failures; consequently Shamrock Foods Company has emphad preventative maintenance, scheduling replacement of parts such as valves and gaskets, and training of maintenance employees in safe operations.\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan has been submitted to the Maricopa County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  All employees are trained on relevant response procedures.  There are written procedures for the use, inspection, maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.  The plan also includes evacuation routes, protective actions for uninvolved employees, a method of accounting for employees, and a list of personal protective equipment for response and mitigation equipment. The Emergency Action Plan also includes a procedure for informing the public and emergency response agencies in case of a release.   \n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe Shamrock Foods Arizona Distribution Center is located at 2929 West Virginia Phoenix, Arizona, \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is anhydrous ammonia.  There is approximately 65,390 lbs. of Ammonia on site separated into three refrigeration systems.  Ammonia is considered an Acutely Hazardous Material and the amount maintai"

The release would extend beyond the property boundary.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario - The RMP regulations require that an alternate scenario be determined that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  The alternate release is also required to reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists. In considering an alternative-case scenario Shamrock Foods Company evaluated the offsite consequences of am incident which occurred on May 7, 2007 which resulted in the release of 4,997 pounds of ammonia over a sixty minute period.  This release scenario satisfies the criteria for the Alternate Toxic Gas Release.\n\n\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm ERPG-2 Type for the alternate case scenario is 0.185 miles.  This release would extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\n\nAll employees are trained on relevant response procedures.

Shamrock Foods Arizona Distribution Center has developed a prevention program that includes safety information, a Hazard and Operability Study, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.\n\n\n\n5.Five-year accidental history.\n\n\n\nShamrock Foods Company has not had any releases in the five years preceding this RMP Resubmission which meet the five-year accident history criteria.\n\n\n\n6.The emergency response program.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Emergency Action Plan described in paragraph 1, plans for evacuation to ensure that the evacuation procedure is adequately addressed and the needs for drills will be assessed. This emergency response program was established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and includes procedures for handling small releases. \n\n\n\n7.Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nThis facility is in the process of improving system controls to improve the safe operation of the three ammonia systems."
