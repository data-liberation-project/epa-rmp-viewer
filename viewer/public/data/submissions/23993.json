Box 399 Clarksville Iowa 50619 \nContact: Dasil Darrow  Phone: 319-278-4729\n\n1. Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Butler County Ag. Packard/ Location  (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 170,000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 54,000  pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards & administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 0.70  mile.  \n\nb. The alternate release scenario: a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down vale/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maxium quantity released would be 28,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .60 mile. (The most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valv"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.22  mile).  \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see  Section 8.3(b).\n\n\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations,  property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6. Emergency Response Program.\n\n The facility has:\n\n  a.  a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facililty.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time"
