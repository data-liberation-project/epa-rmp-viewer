The facility is located in Mocane, OK.  The regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The equipment which handles anhydrous ammonia includes a pressure vessel and associated piping.  The pressure vessels and associated piping may contain over 327,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\n\r\nThe Mocane Ammonia Facility has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  These assets are owned and operated by Magellan Ammonia Pipeline, L.P.  Over the past five years, there have been no reports of a harmful ammonia release at this facility.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the company's policy to notify the LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nThe regulated anhydrous ammonia storage/loading process in the facility is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nThere has been no accidental release from the ammonia process at the Mocane Ammonia Facility that has required rep"

Within the past five years the ammonia process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule.  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the ammonia process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.  \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nNo changes are currently planned to the ammonia process.  As opportunities for improvement associated with the ammonia process arise at the Mocane Ammonia Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Ammonia Pipeline, L.P."
