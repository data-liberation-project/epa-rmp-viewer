If an accidental release should \n                     occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,\n                     or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of\n                     the release to people and the environment.\n\n             2.   Facility Information\n\n\n                   The primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  The primary activity of our\n                    propane facilities is the storage and resale of propane to our member patrons.\n\n                   Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct\n                   application as a fertilizers for crop production \n                   nutrients.  Propane is stored and delivered to member patrons for use in\n                   in heating and grain drying.\n\n\n                    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in a 30,000 gallon capacity\n                     tank at 85% full is 131,325# at the Blencoe, IA facility(Process 1).  In addition, 42 - 1,000 gallon  nurse tanks are generally at this site, at a location north of the office (Process 2 ).            \n\n                    The maximum quantity of propane stored in a 28,000 gallon ca"

The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n                     a.  The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the\n                     release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10\n                     minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 131,325 pounds, which\n                     represents the volume of the storage tank(s) at 85 percent capacity as\n                     limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of 200 PPM)\n                     is 1.1 miles at the location with the largest storage.  The worst case release \n                     scenario for propane would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n                     tank released as a gas.  The maximum quantity release would be 99,996\n                     pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank(s) at 85 percent\n                     capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint\n                     (point of 1-psi overpressure) is a maximum of .4 miles at the location\n                     with the largest storage.\n\n                     b.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year history ( or the\n                     most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transer hose.

In addition, we comply with all applicable, state and local\n             requirements.\n\nOur ammonia systems are protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, barriers, manual shutoffs and emergency shutof valves.  All main storage tank and fill valves are locked when not in use.  The systems are inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guildelines in ANSI standards.  If pumps or valves need repair, repair is performed by an outside company or they are replaced.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  Training consists of classroom lecture, current videos and on the job training.  Topics covered in this training include; safety, operating procedure for plant startup, plant shutdown, filling nurse tanks, unloading a transport, emergency shutdown and startup after emergency shutdown.   \n\n      5.

The Emergency Response Progarm.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and requestt hat they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to insure that they are familiar and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to insure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.\n\n              Western Iowa Coop has:\n              a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n              b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and Community Right\n                   to Know information as required under SARA Title II (EPCRA).\n\n              c.  a written emergency response program in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 \n                   CR 12910.120, including preemergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n      7.
