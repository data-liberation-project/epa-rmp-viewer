The Houston Chemical Plant's accidental release prevention programs prevent accidents at each stage of operations from planning to operation.  New or expanded facilities are built to current engineering standards, and hazard reviews are conducted on all chemical processes.  Process workers are trained and certified in detailed operating procedures.  Equipment is regularly inspected to applicable standards, and inspection is an integral part of the preventative maintenance system.  \n\nCoordinated emergency response actions between the Houston Chemical Plant and local emergency officials are planned and practiced.  By working together, the emergency response teams are prepared to take the necessary measures to protect the public if an incident occurs.  \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant was built in 1943 by the U.S. government to produce synthetic rubber.  After World War II. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. purchased the Houston plant from the government, and has since expanded and modernized the faciity.\n\nSynthetic rubber manufactured at the facility is called \"Plioflex\" rubber.  To produce it, two petrochemicals, butadiene and styrene are reacted with several chemical agents in a soap and water solution.  The reaction of butadiene and styrene to produce rubber gives off heat, and the temperature of reaction is controlled by the coolant anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nButadiene is a flammable substance that is stored under pressure in sufficient quantity to be regulated.  On site use of Anhydrous ammonia and chlorine are also regulated.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe prevention program is guided by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, and applies to process operation containing the chemicals butadiene, anhydrous am"

Process Hazard Analysis of processes containing butadiene, anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine.\n3.  Training and certification program.\n4.  Mechanical integrity program, including:\nVisual internal and external inspection of process equipment\nCorrosion monitoring of vessels and piping\nRoutine testing and maintenance of relief valves\nRoutine testing of safety instrumentation\n5.  Written operating instructions that include safe upper and lower control limits, consequence of deviation , and emergency shutdown procedures.\n6. Leak detection and repair program; covering piping componenets that are monitored quarterly.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant has had no accidental releases of chemicals causing any known off-site environmental impacts in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant is a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid organization (CIMA) which provides emergency response assistance form neighboring plants.  Goodyear conducts training and participates in practice drills with CIMA members.\n\nThe Goodyear emergency response teams are trained in fire fighting, rescue, hazardous materials response, and emergency medical care.\n\nGoodyear Houston is an active member of the Houston Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nPLANNED IMPROVEMENTS\n\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant has programs and systems in place that result in continuous improvement in safety at the facility."
