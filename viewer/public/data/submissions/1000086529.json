      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN: KRAFT Heinz Foods Company, Newberry, SC\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 04/05/2020\n\n\n\n1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Kraft Heinz Foods Company facility in Newberry, SC has a good record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  This facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility uses a real time data base to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week by employees with Emergency Response Training.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Friendly Fire Department, City of Newberry Fire Department, National Response Center, South Carolina State Emergency Response Commission and Department of Health & Environmental Control, in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this location Kraft Heinz Foods Company processes turkeys.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311615 (SIC code 2015).  This facility can produce and packaging various turkey products including delicatessen type items for consumer intake and de-boned and de-feathered turkey portions to be sent to other Kraft Heinz facilities for further processing and packaging.  \n\n\n\nThis facility is equipped to slaughter turkeys.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products.  These include product staging, processing, and storage areas.  Also, this plant employs a blast freezing process in order to adequately preserve portions of processed turkey for shipment to other locations.\n\n\n\nKraft Heinz Foods Company has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68, at this loc"

      "SummaryText": "ation.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the meats in the various areas described above and is also used in the blast freezing process. \n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is 220,028 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to Kraft Heinz in Newberry, S.C.\n\n\n\n3.0 Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Although the alternative release scenario is more likely, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario be reported for each regulated chemical.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n?    Irritation of respiratory tract,\n\n?    Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\n\n?    Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\nThe ammonia release in pounds is grouped as follows:\n\n?    Under Section 68.25(c)(1), a regulated  substance such as ammonia, which is normally a gas at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure, shall be released as a gas over a 10-minute period.  Thus, ammonia's physical state in the worst-case release is a gas.  Passive mitigation controls were not applicable to the worst-case rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease at this plant.\n\n?    The endpoint of 200 ppm for ammonia is based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  This level is the concentration to which an individual could be exposed to for up to one hour without suffering from irreversible or other serious health effects that could impair that individual's ability to leave the affected area.\n\n?    Alternative Release Scenario - The worst-case release is less likely to occur than the following scenario: The alternative release scenario was the US EPA's default scenario as described in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration.  This alternative release scenario would most likely be caused by a gasket rupture or pump seal leak which would result from a 0.25\" diameter orifice.  \n\n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is following OSHA PSM, then it is following RMP Program Kraft's ammonia PSM program has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  There are several aspects of the prevention program that are key: \n\n?    Kraft Heinz maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n?    Kraft Heinz has a PM and inspection program to keep track of maintenance and mechanical supplies that are needed.\n\n?    Utility personnel are present on site and assigned to the ammonia system, 24 hrs. a day, 7 days a week, all year round.\n\n?    Most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and machinery so there is less chance of an ammonia release.\n\n?    There is an ammonia detection system in the plant which alerts the utility personnel of the presence of ammonia.\n\n\n\n5.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nA review of t"

      "SummaryText": "his facility's accident history indicates there has been one accidental spills or releases of ammonia at the facility as defined by 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), in the last five years.  This was a 15 lb loss of ammonia and not reportable.\n\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are 15 in-plant contacts for an emergency which can be found in the Emergency Response Plan.  There are also back-up personnel if the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency response training as well as a detailed description of the training content.  There are also specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire or ammonia emergency.  \n\n\n\nAt the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Newberry County LEPC and Fire Department and other local fire departments and emergency services will be called to provide back-up emergency response and equipment.  The Newberry County LEPC and Fire Department responds to all emergencies where fire alarms are used for evacuation in addition to all fire related emergencies.  Ambulances will be called to the scene if it is deemed necessary.\n\n\n\n7.0   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral Safety Improvements have been made since our last submission. They include but are not limited to the following: Emergency Shutdown system installed and operable, Ventilation System installed, and operable, Enhanced sensor network installed and operable, Additional Control Valve groups relocated to areas remote from operations. Based on in progress PHA re-validations and employee input we will continue to improve safety in the ammonia system.\n\n"
