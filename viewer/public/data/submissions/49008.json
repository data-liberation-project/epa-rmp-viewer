      "SummaryText": "UTi is a supply chain services company that provides transportation management, ground transportation, and warehouse and distribution services. UTi\u00bfs Renaissance Park facility, located at 901 Renaissance Boulevard in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, is used to store packaged finished goods for JohnsonDiversey prior to their distribution.  Because UTi stores aerosol products at the Renaissance Park facility, the site has the potential to exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for flammable substances that are used as propellants in aerosol cans.  Therefore, UTi is submitting a predictive filing for flammable substances.\n\nThe worst-case scenario performed, based on the TNT-Equivalency Method presented in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure will not extend beyond Renaissance Park\u00bfs property line.  Therefore, no public or environmental receptors are impacted.\n\nAn emergency response plan is maintained at the facility and reviewed annually to identify potential plan updates recommended to improve site safety.  No accidental releases of regulated flammable substances have occurred at the facility in the last 5 years.  Coordination of emergency response activities is facilitated by the site\u00bfs inclusion in the Racine County\u00bfs Office of Emergency Management offsite response plan and by compliance with the annual chemical inventory filing requirements of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act program."
