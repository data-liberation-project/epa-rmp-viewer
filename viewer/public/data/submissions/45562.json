This policy is to be enforced through compliance with applicable regulations, physical safeguards, training, and deployment of adequate resources.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response are given the highest priority.\n\n\n\nThe Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 required the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to formulate regulations for managing and reducing the probability of the release of highly hazardous chemicals.  On June 20, 1996, EPA promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR Part 68).  The rule required any stationary source utilizing greater than a specified threshold quantity (TQ) of a regulated substance to develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) to regulatory authorities on or before June 21, 1999.  Regulated substances include 77 air toxics and 63 flammable gases or liquids.\n\n\n\nMCB, Camp Lejeune has one process subject to the EPA RMP regulations:\n\n\n\n*Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), New River Water Treatment Plant (WTP).\n\n\n\nChlorine is the only substance at MCB, Camp Lejeune in excess of the TQ established in 40 CFR 68.130.  The TQ for chlorine is 2,500 pounds.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders and used in the treatment of drinking water.  Historically, other chlorine gas processes have also been subject to the RMP including storage of approximately 180, 150-pound chlorine cylinders  at a storage lot used for disinfection at Base swimming pools, as well as one-ton cylinder storage and use at two additional WTPs.  The Base swimming pools switched to sodium hypochlorite for disinfection and storage of the 150-pound cylinders ended in August 2001.  The WTPs also switched to sodium hypochlorite and ceased usin"

The new plant is scheduled for start-up in 2007 and will also utilize sodium hypochlorite rather than chlorine gas.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessments\n\n\n\nThe chlorine process is subject to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and has offsite impacts in the case of accidental release.  Therefore, MCB, Camp Lejeune has developed and implemented a RMP compliant with all Program Level 3 process requirements established by EPA.\n\n\n\nThe modeling methodology used in this study conforms to the RMP Offsite Consequence Analyses (OCA) guidance recommended in the final RMP rule.  The release scenarios were modeled using RMP*CompTM, an accidental release dispersion modeling package developed by the CAMEO team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division, NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office (CEPPO) of the EPA.  All hazard assessments had offsite impacts.  In 2004 the EPA published RMP rule revisions that for security reasons, the OCA release scenarios are no longer required to be described in this executive summary.\n\n\n\nAs part of MCB, Camp Lejeune's RMP, a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted at three chlorine processes, initially in November 1997 and again in August 2002.  The August 2002 PHA is still valid for the ramaining subject process.  The PHA involved a systematic evaluation of the hazards posed by each process and made risk reduction recommendations.\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) was developed when the original RMP was implemented.  Since then, the ERP has been updated and incorporated into Camp Lejeune's Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) which is a consolidation of all emergency and contingency plans aboard the installation.  The ICP provides guidance and procedures necessary to effectively respond to and prevent fires explosions, spills and/or releases associate"

The National Response Team's ICP Guidance outlined in 61 FR 28642, serves as the basis for the Camp Lejeune ICP.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release History and Prevention Program\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage have occurred in the previous five years from the previously or currently covered processes.  Moreover, no accidents have ever occurred resulting in this type of damage or human impact."
