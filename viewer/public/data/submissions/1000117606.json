As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Fresh Innovations has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP/PSM/CalARP related activities. \n\n1.1 Fresh Innovations, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Fresh Innovations has updated their unified RMP/PSM/CalARP Program.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n(1) Finished Product Room \n(1) Processing Room\n(1) Shipping Room\n\nFacility Location\n\nFresh Innovations is located at 7735 S Highway 99 Stockton, CA 95215. The latitude and longitude of the machinery area is 37.890583, -121.222119. The facility is located on the west side of State Highway 99 in a rural area surrounded by the Stockton Metropolitan Airport and agricultural land.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \u0093an area of minimal flood hazard\u0094.\nFresh Innovations is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Fresh Innovations had a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\nThe USGS 2023 50-State Long-term National Seismic Hazard Model revealed that Fresh Innovations has a 25-50% \u0093chance of slight (or greater) damaging earthquake shaking in 100 years\u0094.\n\nDescription of Covered Process\n\nThe air-cooling evaporators in Processing and Finished Product Rooms are supplied from flooded accumulators while the air-cooling evaporators in the Shipping Room are supplied by a subcooler or high pressure receiver.

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nFresh Innovations has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Fresh Innovations has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP/PSM/CalARP Program implementation.\n\nFresh Innovations considers the RMP/PSM/CalARP Program a \u0093living document\u0094.
