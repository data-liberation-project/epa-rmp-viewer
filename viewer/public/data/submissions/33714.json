      "SummaryText": "Enns Packing Co., Inc. Executive Summary\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Enns Packing Co., Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public \nand environmental safety.  This commitment to safety is demonstrated by \nour comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas \nsuch as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our \npolicy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of \nregulated substances. \n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass packing and storage of grapes \nand non-citrus tree fruit (SIC 0723).  We have 3 Federal and State regulated \nsubstances and one State only regulated substance at our facility.  Ammonia \n(anhydrous) is the only substance above Federal and/or State minimum \nthresholds.  Propane, Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and Methyl Bromide are \nbelow State and Federal thresholds.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for \nRefrigeration.  Propane is used for forklift fuel.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) \nand Methyl Bromide are used for fumigation.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 35308.40 \nlb. distributed in various vessels, pipes and coils.  Regulated substances \nfalling below minimum threshold criteria are 4848 lb. of Propane in a single \nvessel, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) in 70 lb. cylinders at 3 locations totaling \n560 lb. and Methyl Bromide in 5 ? 175 lb. cylinders or 875 lbs.\n\n3.  Worst Case and Alternative Scenario Description\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we \nhave used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference \nTable or Equations. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen \nscenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic \nsubstances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia \n"

      "SummaryText": "Refrigeration equipment.  In this scenario, 13461 lb. of Ammonia \n(anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-\ncm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is \nestimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been \nlimited to 38% of the maximum capacity of the source by a flooded \nAmmonia System design and limited High Pressure Receiver capacity.  At \nClass F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum \ndistance of 1.42 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 \nmg/l.  Because of the rural location and prevailing wind, potential for off-\nsite exposure would be minimal.  The owner and several other family \nmembers live onsite and are closer than public receptors.\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release \nfrom Ammonia Refrigeration equipment.  The scenario involves releasing \n1500 lb. from a typical sight glass, seal, valve or gasket failure on liquid \nvessels or piping.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm \ndeep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated \nto have evaporated after 15.00 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, \nthe maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l of Ammonia \n(anhydrous) is 0.085 miles.  There are no public receptors within this \ndistance. \n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the \nChemical-Specific Preventions Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental \nrelease prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  \nThe facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 \nStandard, 1967 Edition.  \n\n5.  Five-year Accident History    \nEnns Packing Co., Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental \nreleases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention \npolicies, there has been no reportable accidental release during this period.\n\n6.  Emerge"

The plan includes all \naspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical \ntreatment, evaluations, notification of local emergency response agencies \nand the public, as well as, post incident decontamination of affected areas\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is \nregularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated \nto reflect any pertinent changes taking place with our processes that would \nrequire a modified emergency response.  \n\nTulare County Environmental Health is the Local Emergency Planning \nCommittee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and \nverified.\n\n7.  Changes to Improve Safety\nEnns Packing Co., Inc. has instituted several changes during the last 5 years \nto continue to improve the safety of our operation."
