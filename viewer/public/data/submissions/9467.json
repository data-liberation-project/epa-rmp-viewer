The units contain reactors, vessels and separation towers.  All the risk management program elements apply.  The last PHA covering E2 was April 14, 1999.  The last PHA covering E4 was April 13, 1995 and the last PHA covering E7 was August 21, 1995.  All units contain their own storage facilities operated at the units.  Dikes exist in E4, E2 and E7.Flares apply only to E7.  Process area detectors apply to E4 and E7.",

              "Description": "The OSP (Oxide Specialties Process) area has two units:  E-3 and E-6.  Both units react ethylene oxide with either nonylphenol or linear alcohols to form nonylphenolethoxylates and linear alcohol ethyoxylates which are used in industrial and household detergents, among other products.  (The last PHA covering E-3 was in September 1995.  The last PHA covering E-6 was in May, 1995 (this is the most recent for the process).  E-3 unit consists of 3 reactors and associated equipment to charge, react and store product which is non-hazardous.  E-6 unit consists of 5 reactors and associated equipment.  All the risk management program elements apply except for PSSR.  No changes have been significant enough at E-3 or E-6 to require a PSSR.  All changes have been managed by MOCs.",

The F units manufacture ethylene oxide using ethylene and oxygen as reactants (the last PHAs for the F units were: F-2 - September 22, 1995; F-4 - March 27,1998; and F-6 - March 23, 1995).  The G units react ethylene oxide and water for ethylene glycol (see Executive Summary for uses of ethylene glycol).  G-1 unit receives the cycle water bleed streams produced in the F units and recovers antifreeze-grade glycol.  G-2 unit reacts propylene oxide with water to form grades of propylene glycol (see Executive Summary).  G-2 unit can also produce ethyleneglycol. G-3 and G-4 units produce ethylene glycol by purifying reclaimed ethylene glycol returned by polyester manufacturers and by dewatering and dehydrating cycle water and do not contain covered chemicals.  (G-1, G-5 and G-6 last PHA - September 22, 1995; G-2 last PHA - July 18, 1995; G-3 & G-6 last PHA - November 20, 1995)  The risk management program elements for the units listed apply to all units.  The flammable mixture mass noted below includes inventories of non-RMP flammable chemical and RMP flammable chemicals below the threshold quantity.  RMP chemicals below the threshold quantity included in the flammable mixture is ethane.",

              "Description": "The F-5, PO/MTBE process area consists of six sections which are the Feed Preparation, the Peroxidation Reaction, the Epoxidation Reaction, the TBA Purification, the PO Purification and the MTBE sections.  The Feed Preparation Section (last PHA on January 5, 1998) consist of purification towers to purify and concentrate isobutane prior to charging the Peroxidation Section (last PHA December 16, 1997) for reaction with a RMP non-covered chemical.  The Epoxidation Section (last PHA December 18, 1997) manufactures propylene oxide by reacting propylene with a RMP non-covered chemical.  The Tertiary Butyl Alcohol section (last PHA April 9, 1998) reclaims and purifies tertiary butyl alcohol for reuse; the Propylene Oxide Section (last PHA December 7, 1998) does the same for propylene oxide.  The MTBE section (last PHA April 8, 1998) manufactures and purifies MTBE.  The risk management program's elements apply to the F-5 unit.  The flammable mixture mass noted below includes inventories of non-RMP flammable chemical and RMP flammable chemicals below the threshold quantity.  RMP chemicals below the threshold quantity included in the flammable mixture are acetaldehyde, methane, butane and pentane.  This process unit has associated diked storage tanks.",

The Furnace section includes from the feed system through the furnaces up through the quench columns (last PHA done on 6/9/1998). The compression, refrigeration and tower section (last PHA done on 12/21/1998) includes compression, refrigeration and separation equipment downstream of the furnace section as well as an acetylene hydrogenation unit.The A3 offsites (last PHA done on 9/30/1996) includes tankage and ethylene metering skids associated with the A3 Process. All risk management process controls, mitigation, monitoring and detection systems apply to all units as noted below.  Only tankage has dikes and only tankage does not have a quench system and excess flow devices. Only the furnace unit does not have tandem seals.  The flammable mixture mass noted below includes inventories of non-RMP flammable chemicals and RMP flammable chemicals below the threshold quantity. RMP chemicals below the threshold quantity included in the flammable mixture are hydrogen, acetylene, propadiene, vinylacetylene, pentane, ethylacetylene, and 1,3- pentadiene.",

This scenario results in off-site impacts. A rigorous inspection program complying with industry codes and standards, effective operator and maintenance training using procedures consistent with safe operation, and adherence to Process Safety Management reduce the risk of releasing the entire contents of the EO tanks.  Overfilling the tank has been considered and safeguards implemented to reduce the chance of this scenario.
