Pentane is used during two parts of the process, initially during bead formation then later during the drying stage as a paste applied to the beads to provide lubrication during our customers processing. Pentane is brought on site in 36,000-gallon rail cars. Pentane vapors are collected during the process in a spherical gas ball and sent to the boiler for destruction. \n\n\nWorst-case release scenarios\n\n\nEPA has defined a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified end point. At the Painesville site, the only regulated substance that is used is n-pentane, which is a flammable substance. The EPA recently changed the Worst-Case release scenario requirement for flammables that are liquids at ambient temperatures. This change allowed for a more realistic release scenario, where the tank holding the largest amount of the flammable substance fails, causing the entire contents to pool into the surrounding dike. The amount that becomes vapor in the first 10 minutes of the release is used to determine the endpoint during a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nApplying the worst-case scenario definitions at Painesville, the following information was derived:\n\nWorst -Case Scenario: \n\nWorst-case scenario involves a release of the maximum quantity of n-pentane (208,000 lbs.) contained in the pentane storage tank. This would result in a vapor cloud containing 4200 pounds of n-pentane vapor within the first 10 minutes of the release. The release of this amount of n-pentane, coupled with a vapor cloud explosion, would result in a 1 pound per square in. (psi) overpressure at an end point of .13 miles. EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations was the modeling used to determine this overpressure end point.     This endpoint contains no residential receptors but"

Utilizing the knowledge of the operators and the Process Engineer, an alternate case scenario was developed that would have a greater likelihood of occurring. This scenario involves the failure of a 4-inch railcar unloading hose. The area where this would occur has a passive mitigation system consisting of drainage to a gravel dike area where it is possible a vapor cloud fire may occur. The scenario involved active and passive mitigation, involved a release of approximately 157,500 pounds of n-pentane with an RMPComp estimated distance to end point of .06 miles. This scenario does not involve any off site consequences. A more likely scenario involving off site consequences could not be found. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs\n\nTo prevent the situations described above from occurring, these processes are covered under OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, OSHA 1910.119. All 14 elements required under the PSM rule are in place at the site and have been integrated into the prevention plan requirements under the Risk Management Program. Compliance with the PSM rule provides the foundation for compliance with the Risk Management Program.\n\nSome of the specific prevention measures in place include the following: \n* There are pressure relief systems on the storage tanks. \n* Dikes surround the storage tanks. \n* There are on going equipment inspection programs in place to monitor mechanical integrity.\n* The tanks are protected by firewater deluge systems. \n* Area classifications are required to guard against the introduction of ignition sources into the processes. \n* There are hydrocarbon sensors and alarms in the area to detect pentane releases.  \n* The site's operation technicians continuously monitor pentane-unloading operations.  \n\nThere have been no accide"

In fact, pentane has been used at the site for more than 15 years without any major off-site incidents.\n \nTo further improve site safety and emergency preparedness, the Painesville Site coordinates its emergency response plan with the Lake County Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC). The site conducts bi-annual training emergency response drills in conjunction with the LEPC and the local fire department. And the site SHER Specialist maintains close communication with the Lake County LEPC coordinator on a regular basis.\n\nThe next series of site process hazard reviews will begin in 2001. These reviews are required by PSM every 5 years, our last review was in 1996. In addition to PHA's required by OSHA, there is an annual Responsible Care audit performed by internal NOVA Chemicals auditors, as well as a Loss Prevention audit.  Additional focus will be placed on our pentane storage and handling methods during these reviews to determine if additional safeguards should be added to our current Painesville site programs."

The site is bordered on the north by a residential area, with Lake Erie approximately one-half mile to the north. The area south of the site is industrial. The nearest residence abuts our north property line. There are no schools or hospitals within three miles of the site. \n\nCurrently, there are 58 NOVA employees working at the site, in manufacturing, technology and administrative jobs.   \n\nThe Painesville site is a national leader in the production of plastic resin for polystyrene foams. The major product is Dylite expandable polystyrene.\n\nThe NOVA Chemicals Painesville site's approach to chemical safety is best described by the NOVA Chemicals Safety, Health, Environment and Risk Policy, which states that: \n\nNOVA Chemicals is committed to making protection of human health, safety and the environment its first priority. Protection and enhancement of the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers and the public form an integral part of all our business processes including: planning; research; facility acquisition, development and operation; product development; marketing; logistics; waste management; and decommissioning and divestiture of facilities.  NOVA Chemicals readily accepts this life- cycle stewardship responsibility for all of its operations and will be a pace-setting company in its demonstrated performance.\n\nWe operate on the premise that all accidents and incidents are preventable.\n\nWe fulfill this policy commitment through the application of a comprehensive safety, health, environment and risk (SHER) management system which ensures that:\n\n\tIdentifiable safety, health and environmental risks associated with NOVA Chemical's businesses, operations and products are assessed and successfully managed;\n\n\tEffective loss-prevention programs are in place and physical assets are protected;\n\n\tSafety, health an"
