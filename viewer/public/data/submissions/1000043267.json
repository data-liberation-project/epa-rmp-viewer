The HWWTP is located at 4100 Delta Drive in the central portion of the City of El Paso, Texas and within 500 feet from the International Boundary.  The HWWTP is surrounded by industrial, commercial, residential, and vacant land.\n\n\n\nCurrently the HWWTP has the potential to store up to sixteen (16) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage room, allowing the potential to store a total of 32,000 pounds of chlorine. However, the normal storage is eight (8) one-ton chlorine containers at any one time. The average amount of chlorine managed at HWWTP is 16,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \n\n\n\n?    Communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors (Hazard Assessment). \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the ALOHA software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles. The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards.  The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 61,600 people; Mexico's potential affected population was unable to be determined however, a comparable population resides in the worst case vulnerable zone.  The alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people.\n\n \n\nThe RMP rule requires the identification of environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint zone for both worst case and alternative scenarios. The following environmental receptors were identified:\n\n\n\n1. The "
