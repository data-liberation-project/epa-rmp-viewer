      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nThe Northwest Wastewater Treatment Plant, operated by the City of Springfield, has a capacity of 6.4 million gallons per day.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Section 112r regulated substances maintained at the Northwest Wastewater Treatment Plant, which will be referred to herein as the Plant.\n\nPlant Description\nThe Plant maintains two regulated substances on site: chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Chlorine storage is 16,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds. Sulfur dioxide storage is 8,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds The storage and management of both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is addressed in this RMP.  \n\nThe Plant is located at 4801 N. Highway 13, Springfield, Missouri, which is a rural area.  The surrounding area includes some scattered residences.  The plant is about 2 miles from the main highway that leads into Springfield.    \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario for chlorine was calculated as the release of a single one-ton cylinder of either substance in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency guidance for RMP development.  Only passive control systems can be considered for the worst-case release, such as the containment provided by a building.  The conditions of the scenario, such as release time and weather status are those provided in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance. The area of potential impact was determined using RMP*Comp, modeling software developed by the EPA.\n\nThe results of the Worst Case Off-Site Consequence Analysis indicated that the chlorine would travel approximately 2.2 miles under the specified weather conditions before dispersing in the atmosphere to a harmless concentration.  The sulfur dioxide would travel approximately 2.1 miles before dispersing to a harmless concentration.  Since the toxic endpoint for the chlorine release is farther away, it was used at the worst c"

Maps of the area and a list of the types of receptors in the potential impact area are provided in the Off-Site Impact Analysis Section.

The likelihood of such an incident occurring is minimal.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more likely release scenario than the worst case.  Engineered controls, such as detection systems, alarms, or scrubbers are considered in the analysis.  \n\nThe type of system failure selected for the chlorine alternative release was the loss of chlorine due to a break in the flexible tubing leading from the cylinder to the vacuum regulator.  The chlorine would leak from a 3/8\" opening.  The leak would continue until the chlorine detection alarm sounded and the valve on the cylinder could be closed.  Because chlorine would have leaked into the chlorine room, the Springfield Fire Service would respond according to their procedures for a toxic chemical release.  The time for the response was estimated at __ minutes.  Once on site, the fire response personnel would enter the room in protective clothing and close the valve on the leaking cylinder.\n\nThe type of system failure selected for the sulfur dioxide alternative release is very similar to the chlorine release because the two chemicals are stored in identical tanks and are applied with the same fee"

A combination checklist and modified \"What if\" type of analysis was used.  General questions regarding the storage and use areas as well as practices and protocols associated with the management of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems were answered.

Any response requiring entry in a dangerous atmosphere or use of a chlorine repair kit is to be managed by the Springfield Fire Department.  The Plant has an agreement with the Fire Department, which is included in this plan.  A complete copy of the Emergency Response Plan is also included.  \n\nAccident History\nThe Plant has had no chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases in the past five years."
