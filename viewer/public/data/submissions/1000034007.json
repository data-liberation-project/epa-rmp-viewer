      "SummaryText": "at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Port Arthur Complex (PAC or the \"facility\"), operated by Flint Hills Resources Port Arthur, LLC (FHR), is an olefins plant with the capacity to produce nearly 1.4 billion pounds per year of ethylene and 700 million pounds per year of chemical-grade propylene, which are both sold into the merchant market with pipeline access to many major delivery points in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the lower Mississippi River regions. Ethylene and propylene are basic chemical building blocks used to manufacture a variety of products such as trash bags, automotive parts, and medical devices. \n\n\n\nThe facility consists of four main processes:\n\n1.    Light Olefins Unit (LOU),\n\n2.    Aromatics Unit/Cyclohexane Unit (AU/CU),\n\n3.    Utilities operation, and\n\n4.    Offsite Tankage operation \n\n\n\nThere are approximately 28 EPA RMP regulated substances used at the facility in amounts greater than the threshold quantity; the facility is in NAICS code 32511 and is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. Consequently, the facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by FHR.  These high standards include:\n\n\n\n?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\n?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n?    Correcting findings identified in regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n2.1.4    Prevention Program\n\nThe PAC Olefins Plant is operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.

      "SummaryText": "oing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have contributed to process safety and the facility has only one  RMP chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n?    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\n\n?    Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\n?    Minimizing the possibility of a release of propylene with shutdown interlocks installed on process equipment.\n\n?    Reducing the severity of fires with operation of automatic sprinkler and manual deluge systems.\n\n?    Reducing the risk of overfilling by having level alarms and/or indicators on the storage tank.\n\n?    Implementing operating procedures for unloading and transfer operations.\n\n?
