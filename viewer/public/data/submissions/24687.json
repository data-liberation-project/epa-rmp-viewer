THE ANHYDROUS PLANT IS LOCATED ON HARDING DRIVE, WEST OF 40TH AVENUE, there are four tanks, two 30,000 gallon, one 18000 gallon and one 12000 gallon.  The facility is use for the storage of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Proper protective equipm,equipment should always be worn when handling anhydrous ammonia.\n     1.  Nonvented goggles that fit securely.  Never wear contact lenses when working with ammonia.  Goggles are located at the main office and anhydrous plant.\n     2.  Protective gloves are a must.  Neoprene gloves are located at the main office and anhydrous plant.  Wear the cuff up to prevent a blast of ammonia from traveling up the sleeve or arm.\n     3.  If needed, alos use gas mask, slikers, and rubber boots.\n     4.  Approach leaks form the up wind side, spray the leak with water if necessary, and shut off all tank valves.\n  IF THIS FACILITY HAS A RELEASE, WHICH COULD THREATEN HUMAN LIFE OR THE ENVIROMENT OUTSIDE THE FACILITY, THE EMERGENCY COORDINATOR WILL FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES BELOW:                                                              \n     A.  Use internal facility communication two way radios, intercom, and loud speakers to notify all personal of an imminent or existing emergency.\n     B.  Establish that everyone is accounted for and uninjured.  In case of an emergency, everyone should report to the time clock located outside the main office.\n     C.  Assess possible hazards to human health or the environment.\n     D.  Contact fire, emergency response, and police departments if necessary.  Provide them with the name, source, and quantity of the material released.  Briefly describe the nature of the problem.\n     E.  Notify management personnel.\n     F.  Immediately notify appropriate federal, state and local agencies, if assessment indicated that human health or the environment is threatened.  The emergency coordinator will "

WE DETERMINED THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE WOULD BE THE TAMPERING OF EQUIPTMENT BY UNTRAINED INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO OBTAIN ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF ILLEGALLY MANUFACTURING METHAMPHETAMINE.  SMITH FERTILIZER AND GRAIN HAS INITIATED SEVERAL MEASURES TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AND TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE IN THE EVENT AN ACCIDENT WOULD OCCUR.\n     THESE MEASURES INCLUDE:\n1. CONDUCTING REGULAR VISUAL INSPECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO SIGNS OF TAMPERING.\n2. DELIVERING ANHYDROUS AS CLOSE TO TIME OF APPLICATION AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID LEAVING TANKS IN UNATTENDED, DESERTED AREAS.\n3. ENCOURAGING THE PROMPT RETURN OF TANKS FOR THE SAME REASON.\n4. MAKING OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BY HAVING DISCUSSIONS AND DISTRIBUTING LITERATURE.\n\n     Within the past five years, the process has had no accidential release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefor, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RPM."
