This minimizes the chances of an inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n1.60 Emergency Response Program\n\nAmy's Kitchen has a written Emergency Response Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It complies with the provisions of OR-OSHA Emergency Response regulations, OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan has been reviewed with Jackson County Fire District #3.\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Amy's Kitchen and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia-release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n- Incident Command Center\n- Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n- Emergency Response Team\n- Evacuation Plans and Assembly Points\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assista"

      "SummaryText": "1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.10 Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Amy's Kitchen refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant.  Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Amy's Kitchen to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  \n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\nAmy's Kitchen is a manufacturing facility that produces frozen pizzas and other frozen or canned foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the frozen product.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n-The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n-The ammonia refrigeration system's maximum inventory is 35,840 pounds of anhydr"
