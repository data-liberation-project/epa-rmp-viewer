UST is required to address the safety requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 because UST exceeds the 10,000-pound propane threshold.\n\n\n\n(a)   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of UST to operate the facility and heat treatment systems safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the propane system and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.\n\n\n\nSafe operation depends on proper storage, handling, and implementing/maintaining inherent safety features of the systems.\n\n \n\nSafety in storage and handling is achieved through the use of safe handling procedures and training of personnel.\n\n \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plant in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the Chicopee Fire Department\n\n\n\n(b)  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe propane storage tank and associated equipment is used for heating furnaces for the heat treatment of metal parts.\n\n\n\n(c)   GENERAL, ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nUST has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage propane at the facility located in Chicopee, MA\n\n\n\nThe RMP compliance manual is kept, and co"

Propane and process safety information as required by the regulations;\n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures for propane system management; and \n\n?    Propane system maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\nThe following additional steps were implemented to complete the prevention program:\n\n?    Training on RMP and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation;\n\n?    Conducted Process Hazards Analyses for the propane/heat treatment processes;\n\n?    Conducted a Compliance Audit\n\n?    Revised an Emergency Response Plan; and\n\n?    Training in support of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) (current and revised) for various processes and safety measures.\n\n\n\nThere are several roles, outlined in the RMP Manual, each having specific responsibilities under this program, including:\n\n\n\n?    Risk Management Program Coordinator (RMPC)\n\n?    RMP Operations Director\n\n?    Training Supervisors\n\n?    Maintenance Lead (Supervisor)\n\n?    Hazmat Team Chiefs\n\n?

Propane Procedures\n\n\n\nA number of these programs have standard operating procedures and checklists which are requisite for documenting regulatory compliance, particularly for the regulated propane process.  The instructions for completion of the forms are included in the RMP document.  UST completes these forms and maintains documentation in the facility files.\n\n\n\n(d)  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAt approximately 5.00PM on August 22, 2014, a press room operator observed a fire at the propane storage tank area at the rear of the facility.  The Chicopee Fire Department was immediately called.  The Fire Department responded to the fire and shu"

An \"Incident Investigation\" was initiated, including implementation of follow up actions.\n\n\n\nThere have been no additional accidental releases meeting the definition contained in 40 CFR ?68.42(a) within the last five years of operation.\n\n\n\n(e)  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed an Emergency Response Plan.  The plan addressed fire, explosion, spills or release, severe weather, and other criteria.  The plant details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of federal and state agencies.\n\n \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes emergency response to propane releases and fires.  Should an emergency release of propane occur at the facility, the facility will be evacuated, the Chicopee Fire Department will be notified, and the Fire Department will assume Incident Command.\n\n\n\nNOTE:  Facility personnel will evacuate under emergency conditions, they will not perform emergency response duties. (Beyond shutting down equipment remotely, when possible)\n\n\n\n(f)  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe facility completed its most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in August 2017.  As a result of PHA review, a number of improvements to the Risk Management program have either been completed or planned.  The improvements are intended to improve the safety of the process and minimize the potential for a release.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
