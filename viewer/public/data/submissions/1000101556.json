This coordination includes communications as necessary with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and local industry representatives.  U.S. Oil & Refining Co. has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Tacoma Fire Department). Joint exercises are conducted with the Tacoma Fire Department to ensure that its personnel remain familiar with the refinery's equipment and process hazards. This provides a means of notifying the public if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release at the refinery, the Shift Supervisor would determine if the emergency is of a nature that outside assistance is required.  The first outside assistance called is the Tacoma Fire Department for fire, injury, or large vapor or liquid release.  The refinery emergency siren would be activated and personnel evacuated upwind of the release.  The shift supervisor is the initial On-Site Incident Commander.  In the event of a release that could impact areas outside of the refinery, the Tacoma Fire Department is responsible for notification of the neighboring community.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY & ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE\r\n\r\nWe believe that continuous improvement is the best way to be successful in the future.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that procedures, personnel, and the new or modified equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. \r\n\r\nThe PSSR review provides the final check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications, that operator training is complete, and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemente"

Key safety systems are clearly identified in the operating manuals.\r\n\r\nTraining \r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive initial training in refinery operations and maintenance systems.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) they are allowed to work independently. \r\n\r\nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\nContractors \r\n\r\nU.S. Oil & Refining Co. uses contractors for specialty services and to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has a comprehensive pre-qualification pr"

Each Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise, and utilizes one of the methodologies specified in 40 CFR 68.67(b).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary consistent with the requirements in 40 CFR 68.67(c). \r\n\r\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios having the highest risk receive priority attention.  Mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design basis, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and the results and findings from these revalidations are documented and retained.  Team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolutions of the findings are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nClear and concise instructions have been developed by teams of experienced personnel for all facility operations.  The procedures are kept current via updates prepared on an as-needed basis, by annual reviews, and by integrating the Management of Change procedures; revision dates are tracked in the associated documentation.

The program is based on the elements of Process Safety Management (PSM) (OSHA) and Accidental Release Prevention Requirements (EPA).  The PSM elements are fully implemented and integrated into the standard operating practices of the refinery.  Summarized below are brief descriptions of each of the elements:\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nU.S. Oil & Refining Co. actively encourages employees to participate in all phases of process safety management and chemical accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation at the refinery range from updating operating procedures and training manuals, to assignment as a Process Safety Management Specialist, or participating as a member of the Plant Safety Committee, or a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nCritical information on properties of feedstocks, intermediates, and finished products is made readily available to facility personnel through Safety Data Sheets, current drawings, and comprehensive operations manuals.\r\n\r\nThe refinery maintains various technical documentation that provide key information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical classification information, relief system design and the associated design basis, ventilation system designs, design codes and standards, material and energy balances, safety systems information, design pressure, temperature, flow, and process stream composition information.  This information, along with written procedures carried out by trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing excellent inspection and maintenance systems.

Oil & Refining Co. is a petroleum refiner located on 136 acres in the Port of Tacoma with the facilities and personnel to process approximately 42,000 barrels per day of crude oil into products.  The facilities include over three million barrels of storage capacity for crude oil feedstocks, intermediates, and finished products.  The hydrocarbon materials range from volatiles such as liquid butane and gasolines, through distillates such as turbine aviation fuels, diesel and catalytic cracker feedstock, to heavy residuals and byproducts such as fuel oils, asphalt products and liquid sulfur respectively.  The refinery has operated in this location since 1957 and has evolved with the industry into a complex, yet safe, clean, and efficient facility with 177 employees.\r\n\r\nThe refinery, which consists of a crude oil processing area, tank farm, finished product loading racks, crude oil railcar unloading facilities, and office area, is bounded by Marshall Avenue to the South, Lincoln Avenue to the Northwest and Port of Tacoma land to the East, West, and North.  The refinery's main processing units consist of a crude unit, two catalytic reformers, one isomerization unit, one diesel hydrotreater unit, sulfur processing facilities, and ancillary utilities.  The substances handled at the refinery that are regulated under the Risk Management Plan regulation at 40 CFR Part 68 include propane, butane, and pentane.\r\n\r\nIt is our policy to follow responsible safety, environmental, and quality practices to ensure continuous improvements in protecting our employees, the public, and the environment.  Additionally, our training programs ensure employees are aware of their responsibilities and understand the necessity of operating all processes in continuous compliance with all applicable safety and environmental regulations as well as stringent company standards.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe followi"
