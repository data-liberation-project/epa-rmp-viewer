This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the U.S. Foodservice facility. \n\nU.S. Foodservice\u00c2\u00bfs senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  U.S. Foodservice\u00c2\u00bfs safety and environmental policies are administered by the Facility Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers\u00c2\u00bf documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n \nU.S. Foodservice facility is located at 4650 W. Buckeye Road Phoenix, Arizona 85043. This facility provides refrigeration for food products. The process, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment cycles ammonia through various states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient hear causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from approximate"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \u00c2\u00bfnear misses\u00c2\u00bf that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n \nIn the event of a release of ammonia, the facility is a non-responder.  U.S. Foodservice maintains safety plans designed to save lives and to minimize and reduce injuries. The U.S. Foodservice facility is dedicated to its employees safety during normal operation and in emergency situations.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, was conducted on May 20-21, 2009 and provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the U.S. Foodservice facility in Phoenix, Arizona. The U.S. Foodservice safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.\tContinue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n2.\tContinue to have employee involv"
