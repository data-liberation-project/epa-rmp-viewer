This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the U.S. Foodservice facility. \n\nU.S. FoodserviceA?s senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  U.S. FoodserviceA?s safety and environmental policies are administered by the Facility Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturersA? documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n \nU.S. Foodservice facility is located at 4650 W. Buckeye Road Phoenix, Arizona 85043. This facility provides refrigeration for food products. The process, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment cycles ammonia through various states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient hear causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from approximate"

The total ammonia inventory is 17,000 pounds.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nAdministrative Measures:\nThe facility operates in accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and the Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR part 68).\n\nBuilding Codes:\nThe facility was constructed to comply with the current edition of all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, and requirements of the local, county, state, and national bodies having jurisdiction.   \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n \nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (June 2004 A? June 2009) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or A?near missesA? that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n \nIn the event of a release of ammonia, the facility is a non-responder.  U.S. Foodservice maintains safety plans designed to save lives and to minimize and reduce injuries. The U.S. Foodservice facility is dedicated to its employees safety during normal operation and in emergency situations.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, was conducted on May 20-21, 2009 and provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the U.S. Foodservice facility in Phoenix, Arizona. The U.S. Foodservice safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.    Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n2.    Continue to have employee involv"
