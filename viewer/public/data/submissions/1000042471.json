Mid-West Fertilizer, Inc. -  Liberty is an Ag Retail facility that provides inputs for crop production for the local farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is one of those inputs that is important as a nitrogen fertilizer.  The following plan is how Mid-West Fertilizer, Inc. - Liberty plans to prevent accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.The facility policy for accidental release prevention: \na.This facility handles anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA.  Anhydrous ammonia is a valuable tool used in production agriculture as a cost effective fertilizer.  The management of Mid-West Fertilizer, Inc. - Liberty is committed to the safe handling and prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared o work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment. \n                                                                     \n2.Facility Information:                                                                                                                              a.The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for retail sales to area farmers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received stored and distributed for direct application to area fields as fertilizer.  The maximum stored quantity of the storage tanks would be 158,000 lbs. in our two 18,000 gallon storage tanks.                                                                                                                                              \n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario:                                                                                                         a.The Worst Case scenario would be the release of the entire storage tank in a gas release over 10 minutes.
