In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against an international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review, which included a number of audits of various ExxonMobil Corporation facilities, Lloyd's concluded that the \"environmental components of the OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard.\"  They went on to say, \"We further believe ExxonMobil Corporation to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nExxonMobil Baytown Technology & Engineering Complex (BTEC), located in Baytown, Texas, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes for conducting both fundamental and applied research in the development of new and improved processes and products for manufacturing basic and intermediate chemicals, commodity and specialty polymers, as well as, advantaged feed stocks.  Although many regulated flammable substances, flammable mixtures, and toxic substances are contained in these BTEC processes, only two are above the threshold quantity.  BTEC Risk Management Program and Plan (RMP) represent these two chemicals in a single process.\n\n\n\nThe RMP-covered process at BTEC has been determined to be Program 3 per the U. S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP) provisions.  However, the only public receptors potentially affected by the process are limited to workers at the ExxonMobil Baytown Chemical"

Some equipment and operations at BTEC which are not subject to RMP provisions are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.   \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe hazard assessments were completed using EPA's RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  This Guidance covers all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both Worst Case (WCS) and Alternate Release (ARS) scenarios.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at BTEC.  This section addresses the following elements: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  The accident prevention program at BTEC equally covers all individually listed regulated substances, flammable mixtures, and toxic substances.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nBTEC encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the BTEC accident prevention program.  In addition, BTEC has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personnel safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of BTEC, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and BTEC management.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nBTEC keeps a variety of documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

The specific business groups within BTEC are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs or SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, BTEC has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  BTEC ensures that the process is maintained within these safe limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems).\n\n\n\nBTEC also maintains numerous documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  These documents include information such as materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nBTEC has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique.  These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards on the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are appropriate.  \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Mitigation options are identified and evaluated.  Selected mitigation options are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution and completion of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls are consistent with design safety features, BTEC periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These hazard reviews are also performed during the design stage of new facilities and for facilities undergoing significant modification.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nBTEC maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n\n\n(1)     initial startup;\n\n(2)     normal operations;\n\n(3)     temporary operations;\n\n(4)    emergency shutdown;\n\n(5)     emergency operations;\n\n(6)    normal shutdown; and,\n\n(7)     start-up following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.\n\n\n\nThese procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators.

New employees receive basic training in BTEC operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests and/or skills demonstrations) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations technicians periodically receive refresher training on key operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted yearly on critical procedures and at least every three years on non-critical procedures.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nTraining is also provided for each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or else the equipment use will be reviewed to determine what actions are necessary to ensure the continued safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  BTEC incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nBTEC has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  These include orientations for visitors/contractors, control of the entry/exit of support personnel, energy isolation for equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work permit/procedure to safely manage spark-producing activities, control of vehicle entry into process area, confined space entry permit/procedure to help ensure precautions are taken before entering confined spaces, and job safety analyses to identify and mitigate hazard"

These practices are primarily documented in the Safety Manual and the BTEC Maintenance Manual.  \n\n\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nBTEC has a comprehensive system to manage changes to process.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to:\n\n\n\n(1)    ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards; and,\n\n(2)    verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\n\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition operations personnel are provided any necessary training before the change is implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nBTEC promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental impact, or personnel injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to BTEC management for resolution.\n\nCorrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  The resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the findings including contract employees where applicable.  Incident investigation reports are retained indefinitely "

Compliance audits (PSM/RMP, External SHE Regulatory, and OIMS) are conducted at least every 3 to 4 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to BTEC management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained on file.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at BTEC have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized above is applied to all RMP covered processes at BTEC.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, BTEC has safety features on many processes to:\n\n\n\n(1)    quickly detect a release;\n\n(2)     contain/control a release; and,\n\n(3)    reduce the consequences (mitigate) of a release.\n\n\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\n\n1.
