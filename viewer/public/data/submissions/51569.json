A number of processes at our faciity are subject to the Occupatonal Safety and Health Adminstrtioan (OSHA) Processes Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following section briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCorsicana maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of the information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. Corsicana primarily uses the checklist and HAZOP method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nFor the purposes of safety conducting activiites within our covered processes, Corsicana maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency oeprations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nCorsicana develops and impl"
