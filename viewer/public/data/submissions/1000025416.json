Additional information/Assumptions ex: It was assumed that the natural gas in the plant consists of pure methane.  Lengths of lines and volumes of certain vessels were assumed based on good engineering practices.  A table of this information is shown in Appendix 1.  \r\n\r\nApplicability of Program Levels\r\n\r\nLocation of facility\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners LP owns and operates the Alliance Compression and Treating Facility (ACTF) in Denton County, Texas.  Coordinates for the facility are: N 33\u00b0 2.09892 latitude and W 097\u00b0 20.834 longitude.  The facility is located approximately 4 miles West of I-35 W on Hwy 114 in Denton County and is South off Hwy 114.\r\n\r\nThe facility location is shown on the accompanying USGS topographical map and location maps in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2.  Alliance is surrounded by fields, developed and undeveloped land with Northwest ISD schools to the East including Elementary, Middle and High Schools and several accompanying ball fields.  Railroad tracks and easements run southeast of the facility.  There are two dry creeks bounding the location with one running north to south on the West side and the other running north to south on the East side of the location.  Elizabeth Creek is south of the location running southeast.  A recent aerial photograph, location map, and a USGS topographic map of the area around the Alliance Compressor Station are presented in Appendix 2. \r\n\r\nDefinition of Program Levels\r\n\r\nProgram 1: Processes which would not affect the public in the case of a worst-case release (in the language of Part 68, processes with no public receptors within the distance to an endpoint from a worst-case"

The facility is eligible for Program 1 as it does not have a public receptor within the distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion for the regulated substance.  The facility is not eligible Program 2 because it is an OSHA PSM facility. This places the plant under program 1 requirements. \r\n\r\nThe EPA program RMP*COMP was used to determine the endpoints for worst case scenarios for each regulated substance.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Alliance Compressor Station has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Alliance Compressor Station uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, Crestwood Midstream Partners LP has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners LP conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners LP has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

The facility is equipped with a control room and flare/vent systems for upsets. \r\n\r\nFor a more detailed description of this facility, please consult the Operating Manual and study the process and instrument diagrams.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the processes at the Alliance Compressor Station that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners LP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\r\n \r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners LP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemic"

The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\nThe Alliance Compressor Station also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners LP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners LP primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis tech"

      "SummaryText": "nique to perform this evaluation.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Alliance Compressor Station periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nAlliance Compressor Station maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These p"
