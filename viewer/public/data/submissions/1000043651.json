It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local\r\nrules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, the\r\nsafety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use\r\nand the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with ANSI K-61.1 and OSHA 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia\r\nstorage.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency\r\nresponse agency.\r\n\r\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage.  We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport\r\ntruck and store it as a liquid in pressurized vessels.  Access to the process is restricted to\r\nauthorized employees and contractors.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be\r\nstored at this facility is 30,000 gallons (water capacity).\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local\r\ncodes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained\r\nin accordance with ANSI K-61.1, OSHA 1910.111 and state law.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nWe maintain safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and\r\nequipment designs associated with our anhydrous ammonia storage facilities.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Review\r\nOur Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (E"
