The reason for submitting this RMP is to report the change of ownership from Gold Kist Inc to Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation. The Worst Case Scenario was also updated to be in line with our company standard method of developing.  We are taking this opportunity to resubmit the entire RMP to be in compliance with the five year mandatory update due next year.  This facility has one refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in this system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  .\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the Athens Clarke Fire Department and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply wit"

We do have several passive and active mitigation systems to minimize any effect incidents like these would have.  We also incorporate several management systems to decrease the likelihood of this incident occurring.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\u00bf Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners\n\u00bf Preventative maintenance program\n\u00bf Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners\n\u00bf Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\n\u00bf Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\u00bf Procedure for handling all changes to the system\n\u00bf Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\n\u00bf Up-to-date process safety information\n\u00bf Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\n\u00bf Hot-work permits for work on or near the ammonia process.\n\u00bf Line Break procedures\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.

The Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance of the refrigeration equipment.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system, as required under the regulations.
