Inc are \ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper\nequipment, regular inspections and maintanence and training of all persons that work with the material.\nShould an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the fire department and local emergency planning commitee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to \npeople and the environment.\n\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity of the facility is the storage and sale to farmers of anhydrous\nammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia ia received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop \nproduction nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 168,000 pounds in the facility's 3 tanks.\nThe capacity of each of the three tanks is 56,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the contents of the storage tank released\nas a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released  would be 56,000 pounds, which represents\nthe volume or the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company \nprocedures.  The distance of the endpoint of dispersion based on model used is 1.8 miles.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1 inch transfer \nhose, with 26,600 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the end point of dispertion is\n1.6 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  The regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistant\nwith ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding stoarage and handling of anhydrous amm"

The Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia\nfor the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant \nproperty damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths,\ninjuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance\nwith OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning \nand community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local \nemergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.\nPeriodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintanence of safe practices and operations.\nThere are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation\nat this time."
