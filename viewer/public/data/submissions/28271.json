A combined cycled operating unit, Stanton Unit A, is currently under construction north of the existing units.  Stanton Unit A is scheduled to begin commercial operation in October 2003 as a 633 MW facility.  Stanton Unit A is jointly owned by Orlando Utilities Commission, Kissimmee Utility Authority, Florida Municipal Power Agency, and Southern Company-Florida.  The new unit will be operated by Southern Company-Florida.\n\nEmployee safety and health is a fundamental value of Southern Comapny-Florida.  It is the policy of the facility to provide and maintain safe working conditions and to operate and manage facilities in a manner that protects the environment and meets or surpasses all federal, state, and local environmental regulations.  Stanton Unit A has a safety program designed to ensure that employees\u00bf and contractors\u00bf are working in a safe environment.  The program includes training, operating and maintenance procedures, as well as an auditing and incident investigation programs.\n\nStanton Unit A will have two processes that are covered under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations, 40 CFR Part 68, as Program 3 processes.  Anhydrous ammonia will be stored on-site in one 18,000 gallon tank for use as part of the Selective Catalytic Reductions system used to control nitrogen oxide emissions generated from burning natural gas.  The facility will use chlorine as a biocide to treat the cooling water.  Stanton Unit A plans to bring six one ton chlorine cylinders on site May 22, 2003.  The maximum amount of chlorine that will be stored on site is 12,000 lbs.  The enclosed submittal only includes the information required for the chlorine process.  The RMP will be revised to include ammonia and resubmitted prior to bringing ammonia on site in mid June 2003.\n\nThe worst case chlorine release scenario was defined"

      "SummaryText": "as the release of the largest single vessel occurring over ten minutes.  The RMP*COMP version 1.07 model predicted that        \nthe chlorine gas would travel 3.0 miles before it reached its endpoint.  The 2000 Census data predicted that 5,100 people would be affected by a worst case chlorine release.  A valve failure resulting in a 0.75\u00bf' rupture was used for the alternative case scenario.  It predicted that at a release rate of 151.9 lb/min the chlorine would travel 0.6 miles before it reached its endpoint.  This alternative release scenario would affect approximately 205 people.\n\nNo spills have occurred at Stanton Unit A in the past five years.\n\nStanton Unit A has developed an emergency response plan that complies with 29 CFR 1910.38 to protect the public health and the environment.  This plan includes procedures for notifying the public about accidental releases, procedures for the use and maintenance of response equipment, employee training, and procedures to review and update the plan.    The Orange County Fire Department has visited the site and been made aware of the facility\u00bfs emergency response procedures.  Emergency notification will be made by dialing 911 to notify the Orange County Fire Department Haz-Mat team."
