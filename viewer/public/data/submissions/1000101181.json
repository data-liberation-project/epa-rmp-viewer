Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sun Pacific Reedley has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Sun Pacific Reedley, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sun Pacific Reedley has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name             | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration      Anhydrous Ammonia           67,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet CalARP and RMP ob"

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n(25) Controlled Atmosphere (CA) Rooms\r\n(12) Cold Rooms\r\n(2) Hallways\r\n(1) Loading Dock\r\n(1) Precool Room\r\n(4) Ripening Rooms\r\n(1) Ripening Rooms Staging Area\r\n\r\n1.2.2 Facility Location\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Reedley is located at 707 W South Ave, Reedley, CA 93654. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.616591, -119.454781. The facility is located approximately 12 miles east of state highway 99 on the north end of the City of Reedley.\r\n\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Reedley is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Sun Pacific Reedley has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\r\n\r\nThe cold rooms, CA rooms, hallways and loading docks are equipped with air cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. The ripening rooms are equipped with DX (direct expansion) evaporators.\r\n\r\nAll control valve groups are located on the roofs to provide easy access.

The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun Pacific Reedley facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at Sun Pacific Reedley in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Reedley's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release.

Nevertheless, Sun Pacific Reedley continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sun Pacific Reedley's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sun Pacific Reedley's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Reedley has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sun Pacific Reedley has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\nFor the future, Sun Pacific Reedley now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Sun Pacific Reedley employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Sun Pacific Reedley will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
