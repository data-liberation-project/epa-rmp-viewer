This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR Part 68.155.  The Aberdeen Water Treatment facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of chlorine, a regulated toxic substance, above the threshold quantities. This RMP submittal is a revalidation RMP submittal for Aberdeen Water Treatment.\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nAberdeen Water Treatment is committed to protecting the environment and water treatment facility in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel, Aberdeen Water Treatment has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.  \n\n\n\nIn the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response actions are described in its Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP). The ERAP includes procedures to coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel (i.e., law enforcement, fire, and rescue departments, emergency medical services, hospital and government personnel, etc.). In addition, the ERAP is used to familiarize local emergency response personnel with Aberdeen Water Treatment's emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n2.

The facility requires the use of chlorine as a disinfectant for the potable municipal water supply. \n\n\n\nThe facility is located approximately 7 miles north of Aberdeen, South Dakota, in a rural setting. The facility was originally constructed in 1934 as a municipal water treatment facility.\n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe Aberdeen Water Treatment facility has developed programs to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, process safety management (PSM) requirements from OSHA, and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information:\n\n\n\nThe facility uses the what-if process hazard analysis (PHA) methodology. The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: toxic release, over pressurization, corrosion, and equipment failure. The facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the plant. The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and piping and instrument drawings.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures related to the chlorination process. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes contract support on a periodic basis. Contractors performing services on or near the regulated process will require a contractor screening process and hazards training prior to initiation of services on site.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nThe facility has prepared a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) process for any change or modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, proced"

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Incident Investigation review process to promptly investigate any incident that could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance. Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nThe facility will conduct audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. The audits will include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with plant personnel.\n\n\n\n4.    Five Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThe facility has not been regulated under RMP previously so the facility has not had any accidents reportable under RMP in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan. The plan is addresses aspects of chlorine release scenarios, emergency response, notification of the public and local agencies if a release occurs, and information on emergency health care for exposures.
