Therefore, Marva Maid Dairy endeavors to take all appropriate steps to minimize the possibility and impact of accidents and releases. These steps include proper training of employees, development of safety programs and operating procedures and frequent review and refresher training. Since Marva Maid Dairy recognizes that accidents may occur regardless of its efforts related to training, planning and program development, it is also the policy of Marva Maid Dairy to be prepared for any possible contingency. \n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the Marva Maid PSM/RMP (MMPSM) program is to prevent an unintentional release of anhydrous ammonia. Secondly, the program elements aid us in mitigation and minimization of the consequences of such a release should it occur. Lastly, the MMPSM program is designed to provide documentation which demonstrates compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management Regulation (PSM), the EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management (RMP) Regulation, and the EPA General Duty Requirements. The MMPSM program provides a framework for making PSM compliance an integral part of our business activities. It establishes and documents a Management system which assigns responsibility for developing, implementing, and integrating various elements of the PSM/RMP program into the daily routine of the business. \n\n\n\n2.0 PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nCovered Process:\n\nThe covered process is an ammonia refrigeration system serving a dairy facility, providing storage for milk and other dairy products providing two primary missions:\n\n\n\n1. Maintain storage and production areas at approximately 34?F to 40?F to preserve quality and freshness of the product.\n\n\n\n2. Maintain glycol at approximately 28?F for use in the various production processes.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\nCompressors:\n\nThe system has 7 compressors operating as a single stage system. The system is designed at 78?F wet bulb and 34 PSIG suction pressure. The screw compressors all utilize liquid injection oil cooling. All compressors are staged utilizing a microcontroller system.\n\n\n\nCondensers:\n\nThe system has 3 evaporative condensers. The system has an auto-purger to insure the removal of air or other non-condensables and utilizes a treatment system to control algae, bacteria, fungus and scaling.\n\n\n\nReceivers / Vessels:\n\nThe system has one high pressure receiver, one large recirculating receiver and one suction accumulator.\n\n\n\nEvaporators / Chillers:\n\nThe system utilizes some 15 pump overfed evaporators to provide climate control for the entire processing and storage facility. Additionally, there is 1 flooded chiller providing chilled glycol for the processing areas. \n\n\n\n3.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn an effort to insure the general safety and well-being of plant personnel as well as the community, Marva Maid Dairy has implemented numerous safety and emergency preparedness programs. These include Lock-Out / Tag Out, Permit Entry Confined Space Entry, Emergency Response, and others. Standard Operating Procedures have been developed to establish uniformity and safety in the day to day operations of the refrigeration system. Additionally, Marva Maid Dairy has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program to insure the knowledge and skill levels of its employees and operators is developed and maintained at a high level of proficiency. The key element and foundation of the Marva Maid Dairy safety and training programs is the Marva Maid Dairy Risk Management and Prevention Program.\n\n\n\n4.0 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\n\n\nDuring the five year period preceding this report, there have been no releases from covered processes that resulted in significant property damage on or off site. \n\n\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY R"

      "SummaryText": "ESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIt is the intent of Marva Maid Dairy to prevent all foreseeable emergencies. Emergencies are not completely preventable so this plan defines the framework for an effective emergency response. The framework addresses such issues as training, preparation, assignment of authority, and risk assessment. It gives employees procedures to follow for effective and safe actions during an emergency, including evacuation. The Marva Maid Dairy emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies. We work with the local Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nBecause risk management is a continuous process, periodic audits are used to identify potential improvements related to hazard mitigation, mechanical integrity, and compliance. Action items are generated and their status is monitored to ensure implementation. Additionally, we search for and take advantage of opportunities to enhance operator skills and constantly look for ways to reduce hazardous chemical inventories.\n\n\n\n"
