RRGC is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Summit Midstream Partners, LLC (\"Summit Midstream\" or the \"Company\").\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are represented in the Summit Safety Manual and Emergency Response Plan. Summit Midstream takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals. As for emergency response, the Company has established and maintained site-specific procedures for emergency notification and response. These procedures are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\r\n\r\nSummit Midstream understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Summit Safety Manual and Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Foundation Creek Gas Plant is located at 41501 Highway 139 in rural Rio Blanco County, Colorado.  The gas plant was purchased by Summit Midstream through its subsidiary, RRGC, from ETC Canyon Pipeline, LLC in 2012 and remained operational until March, 2014.  Previously, the facility processed natural gas, produced natural gas liquids (NGLs), stored NGLs in above ground pressurized tanks, and delivered NGLs into pressurized tank trucks for delivery into an interstate pipeline. Currently, the plant is de-inventoried with the exception of some"

NGL is a flammable pressurized liquid mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including RMP-regulated flammables methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane, and pentane. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present on site. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Steps\r\n\r\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Summit Safety Manual and Emergency Response Plan. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nSummit Midstream has established and coordinated emergency response action plans with the Rangely Fire Department  The emergency response plan also includes procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies, if a release occurs.  The specific details of the action plans are documented in the Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 68.12(b)(1) of the RMP rule, Summit Midstream analyzed a worst-case flammable release scenario (no RMP regulated toxic substances are present) for the single RMP process at the Foundation Creek Gas Plant.  The worst-case release scenario (WCS) assumed a vapor cloud explosion modeled using EPA's RMP*Comp software which assumes a 10 percent yield factor using a TNT equivalent method per the RMP rule.  Summit Midstream confirmed that the nearest public receptor to the Foundation Creek Gas Plant is beyond the 1-psi overpressure endpoint distance of the flammable WCS.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials at the Foundation Creek Gas Plant meeting the five-y"

Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."
