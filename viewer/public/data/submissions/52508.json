The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with general safety standards, such as NFPA, Compressed Gas Association safe handling practices, Uniform Fire Code and other generally accepted practices.  The system is designed with safety backups throughout, such as backup valves in case one fails.  Many other safety regulations have also been implemented, including OSHA PSM and hazardous material inventory and business plan reporting.\n\nFire prevention is accomplished by controlling access and posting for \"no smoking.\"  In addition, the facility has hot work procedures, a water sprinkler deluge system, and UV detection all designed to prevent fires from affecting the storage tanks.  There are also hydrocarbon detectors in the test area to detect releases of LNG or LPG around the tanks, the test stand and the flare.\n\n \n\n4.
