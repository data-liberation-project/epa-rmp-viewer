      "SummaryText": "Omaha Steaks conducted a PHA study on May 20, 2000, on the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility located at 9203 \"F\" Street, in Omaha, Nebraska. The previous PHA study was conducted in January 1999, prior to the implementation of the RMP Program. Omaha Steaks purchased the F Street facility in May of 1998. After the purchase, Omaha Steaks operated only in a segment of this building, the other segment being occupied by Butch Long Steaks, a company which operated a meat production and distribution enterprise. In January of 2000, Omaha Steaks took possession of the portion of the building, previously occupied by Butch Long. A decision was made to upgrade the production area, and turn it into a beef-patty manufacturing operation.\n\nThe upgrades to the ammonia system, in the production area, made it evident that a PHA was required, by the OSHA's PSM Standard, Title 29, CFR, part 68. Although these changes and upgrades to the system did not alter any of the Off-Site Consequences, at the suggestion of EPA personnel at Region VII Headquarters, Omaha Steaks decided to update the company's RMP, on file with the EPA.\n\nOmaha Steaks is confident that this upgrade, combined with employee and contractor training, will enable the facility to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, and also will help minimize the on-site, and the off-site consequences of accidental releases. Our safety programs continue to be applied to any and all activities involving the process, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of ammonia. Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary, and are communicated and accepted by all employees at the facility."
