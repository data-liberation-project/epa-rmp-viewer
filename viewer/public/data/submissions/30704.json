This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our  trained personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Sebewaing Twp. Fire Dept.,  which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass Storage and transfer of agricultural anhydrous ammonia..  We have only that one regulated substance present at our facility. The ammonia at our facility is simply stored for delivery and use as an agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 80,000.00 lb., which is on hand when the storage tank is 85% filled. For safety purposes, the tank is never filled beyond 85%.\n\n\n\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility complies with the requirements of several regulations, including requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. Is also complies with other Federal, and State regulations.\nAdditionally, our facility is inspected regularly by government agencies. Any recommendations made are promptly followed.\n\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\nCooperative Elevator Co. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with acciden"
