      "SummaryText": "Greenwood Resources / Sandpiper Tree Farm has established a Risk Management Plan according to the federal regulation for the Chlorination Systems to enhance its safety practices.  Greenwood Resources / Sandpiper Tree Farm management is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and surrounding occupancies.\n\nGreenwood Resources / Sandpiper Tree Farm policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal RMP Program, i.e., chlorine.  Greenwood Resources / Sandpiper Tree Farm trains its employees to properly handle and store hazardous materials, to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  The Greenwood Resources / Sandpiper Tree Farm Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThis PHA addresses the Chlorination Systems located at the Sandpiper Tree Farm that are used for disinfecting water used in the irrigation system.  Chlorine is delivered to each site in 150 lb. cylinders.  There are two cylinders at each site.  \n\nSystem piping diagrams are provided in Appendix A.  Chlorine, in its gaseous form, is transferred from the 150 lb. cylinders to the injectors entirely under vacuum.  The motive power for this transfer is provided by the venturi effect of the injectors.  Water flow through the injectors creates a pressure drop in the chlorine line attached to the venturi.  The vacuum regulator, attached to the chlorine cylinder would allow chlorine flow only when downstream pressure is in vacuum.  \n\nSystem flow rate is controlled by the chlorinator, which is set by the Chlorination System Operators.  In case of loss of vacuum (e.g., a break in piping integrity) a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator closes, stoppi"

      "SummaryText": "ng chlorine from escaping the cylinder.  This is an important safety feature, which minimizes the likelihood of a release.  \n\nChlorination Systems operate at their set flow rate continuously and under normal conditions there is little need for operator intervention.  Operators, however, check the system periodically and provide the needed tests, inspections and maintenance activities.  All elements of the system are subjected to a periodic inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance program.  \n\nChlorination is needed only eight months in a typical year.  The chlorine cylinders are removed from the sites when chlorination is not needed.  Fresh cylinders are brought in at the beginning of chlorination season.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nGreenwood Resources / Sandpiper Tree Farm has an RMP program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  \n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (i.e., August 2003 to August 2008) for the Greenwood Resources / Sandpiper Tree Farm Chlorine Systems reveals that there have been no reportable accidents during this period.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral process and management system improvements are being considered and implemented because of the technical studies performed in the course of the development of the Risk Management"
