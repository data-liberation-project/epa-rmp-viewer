      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared for the ADM Decatur Complex.    The Decatur Complex is an industrial complex with contiguous and adjacent facilities consisting of an East Complex and a West Complex, as well as additional support facilities.  The following locations are covered by this RMP:  Corn Processing, BioProducts, East Plant, Glycols, and Cogeneration within the East Complex and Vitamin E and the West Soybean Refinery Facility within the West Complex.\n\n  \n\nEach listed location employs chemical specific safety precautions in handling hazardous chemicals to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community and the environment.    Emergency response for the ADM Decatur Complex is coordinated with ADM Personnel and the Decatur Fire Department.   Each location has its own emergency response plan and prevention program.  In addition, within the response plans, each location has developed chemical specific response strategies applicable to their location. The plans also include procedures for notifying the appropriate personnel and agencies in the event of an accident involving a hazardous chemical.  The Emergency Response Plan review and training dates listed in Section 9 of this RMP are based upon the most recent plan reviews and training dates conducted within the Decatur Complex.  The most recent review of the Emergency Response Plan was conducted by the BioProducts facility on April 23, 2015. The most recent Emergency Response Plan training was conducted at the West Refinery on February 25, 2015.   The most recent safety inspection within the complex was conducted at the West Refinery on 4/21/2015, by the State of Illinois-Office of the State Fire Marshall. \n\n\n\nThis plan addresses the following three chemicals: \n\n\n\n1)    Anhydrous Ammonia -   BioProducts and Cogeneration \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and rail and stored in three storage tanks.  At the BioProducts facility, anhydrous ammonia is used as a pH control and a nitrogen so"

At the ADM Cogeneration facility, anhydrous ammonia is utilized to reduce emissions of nitrous oxides.   \n\n\n\n2)    Pentane - Corn Processing \n\n\"Natural Gasoline\" containing pentanes (n-pentane and iso-pentane, both a \"flammable chemical\") is used to denature ethyl alcohol prior to being stored for load-out.  \n\n\n\n3)    Hydrogen - Corn Processing, Glycols, West Plant Refinery and Vitamin E\n\nHydrogen is produced at the Glycols and West Refinery plants. It is used at Glycols to produce propylene glycol. It is used at the West Refinery to hydrogenate vegetable oil. The Corn Processing facility utilizes hydrogen to produce sorbitol. The Vitamin E Plant uses hydrogen to produce Alpha tocopherol from non-Alpha tocopherols. All plants store hydrogen. Glycols, Corn Processing, and Vitamin E use compressors to increase the pressure of hydrogen which is required for each of their processes. The Corn Processing facility and the Glycols facility share a low pressure hydrogen pipeline between locations and as well as a high pressure pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program Descriptions for each covered process provide information related to the prevention program details, emergency response plan reviews and training at the specified location.  The key concepts of ADM's prevention programs are the elements of each location's site specific Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Each location's emergency response plans are coordinated with ADM personnel and/or the Decatur Fire Department, such that, in the event of an accident/incident, immediate emergency response measures can be implemented.  ADM works cooperatively with the Decatur Fire Department to improve response capabilities.  \n\n\n\nIn the past five years, the ADM facilities listed above have not experienced any accidents/incidents involving the referenced covered processes that have required reporting under this standard.  \n\n\n\nADM personnel focus on safety on a daily basis.

The locations continue to evaluate options for improving processes and efficiencies in order to reduce the quantities of hazardous materials used and stored at its facilities.  In addition, ADM also continually evaluates options at its facilities for replacing hazardous materials with less hazardous or non-hazardous materials.  Continued safe operations are a result of the following:  precautions used in handling hazardous chemicals, personnel training, and the engineering of inherent safety features in the design of equipment.  \n\n"
