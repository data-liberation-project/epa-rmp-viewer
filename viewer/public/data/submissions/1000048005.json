              "Description": "The ADM Glycols facility (1000060629) is located within the ADM Decatur Complex and produces hydrogen by the steam reforming of desulfurized natural gas. Hydrogen is purified and stored in a low pressure storage tank before it is sent to compressors. Low pressure hydrogen is also piped to the Corn Plant (1000060744 and 1000059961) low pressure storage tank.  High pressure hydrogen is stored in high pressure storage tanks and is piped from these tanks to the glycols production area.  High pressure hydrogen is also piped to the Corn Plant (1000060744 and 1000059961) high pressure storage tanks. Hydrogen enters the hydrogen discharge pipe header which is connected to two reactor trains in which it reacts with glycerin over a catalyst to produce glycols. The Glycols facility (1000060629) has a hazard prevention program for the process.  The facility?s program is a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program which addresses the Prevention Program 3 requirements of 40 CFR ?68.175. The program covers hydrogenolysis, hydrogen production, compression, and storage. All safeguards described in this section (e.g., process controls, mitigation systems, monitoring/detection systems) apply to the hydrogen systems at the Glycols Plant.\n\n\n\nPlant Manager: Michael Kruley\n\nDate of Emergency Response Plan Review/Update: 7/25/2014\n\nDate of Emergency Response Plan Training for employees: 9/14/2014\n\nLast Safety Inspection by External Agency: 7/22/2014\n\nName of Agency: Illinois Environmental Protection Agency\n\n",

The Decatur Complex is an industrial complex with contiguous and adjacent facilities consisting of an East Complex and a West Complex, as well as additional support facilities.  The following locations are covered by this RMP:  Corn Processing, BioProducts, East Plant, Glycols, and Cogeneration within the East Complex and Vitamin E and the West Soybean Refinery Facility within the West Complex.\n\n  \n\nEach listed location employs chemical specific safety precautions in handling hazardous chemicals to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community and the environment.    Emergency response for the ADM Decatur Complex is coordinated with ADM Personnel and the Decatur Fire Department.   Each location has its own emergency response plan and prevention program.  In addition, within the response plans, each location has developed chemical specific response strategies applicable to their location. The plans also include procedures for notifying the appropriate personnel and agencies in the event of an accident involving a hazardous chemical.  The Emergency Response Plan review and training dates listed in Section 9 of this RMP are based upon the most recent plan reviews and training dates conducted within the Decatur Complex.  The most recent review of the Emergency Response Plan was conducted by the BioProducts facility on April 23, 2015. The most recent Emergency Response Plan training was conducted at the West Refinery on February 25, 2015.   The most recent safety inspection within the complex was conducted at the West Refinery on 4/21/2015, by the State of Illinois-Office of the State Fire Marshall. \n\n\n\nThis plan addresses the following three chemicals: \n\n\n\n1)    Anhydrous Ammonia -   BioProducts and Cogeneration \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and rail and stored in three storage tanks.

It is used at Glycols to produce propylene glycol. It is used at the West Refinery to hydrogenate vegetable oil. The Corn Processing facility utilizes hydrogen to produce sorbitol. The Vitamin E Plant uses hydrogen to produce Alpha tocopherol from non-Alpha tocopherols. All plants store hydrogen. Glycols, Corn Processing, and Vitamin E use compressors to increase the pressure of hydrogen which is required for each of their processes. The Corn Processing facility and the Glycols facility share a low pressure hydrogen pipeline between locations and as well as a high pressure pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program Descriptions for each covered process provide information related to the prevention program details, emergency response plan reviews and training at the specified location.  The key concepts of ADM's prevention programs are the elements of each location's site specific Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Each location's emergency response plans are coordinated with ADM personnel and/or the Decatur Fire Department, such that, in the event of an accident/incident, immediate emergency response measures can be implemented.
