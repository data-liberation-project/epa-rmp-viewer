Our safety culture starts with our organizational leaders and extends to everyone involved in our business.  Our daily workplace safety priorities are focused on four areas:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety Leadership: Encourage a culture of caring.\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Identification: Take the time to recognize and mitigate hazards.\r\n\u00bf\tFrequent and Structured Pause: Be willing to stop work when you're unsure whether it's safe to proceed.\r\n\u00bf\tSerious Injury and Fatality Prevention: Respectfully challenge each other about how we perform work.\r\n\r\nPCS believes it's critical to minimize the impact our operations or products have on the environment. We have comprehensive environmental stewardship programs at our sites and with key stakeholders.\r\n\r\nAs employees of PCS, we have the responsibility to manage our operations to protect human health and the environment. Sound health, safety and environmental policies are an integral part of our everyday job requirements.  In recognition of this responsibility, we will correct any unsound health, safety, and environmental practices or conditions, or call them to the attention of those who will do so, as soon as they are identified.  Specifically, we will:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tConduct our operations in compliance with any applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.\r\n\u00bf\tContinue to improve our safety, health, and environmental performance through the Augusta Does Accident Prevention Together (ADAPT) Process.\r\n\u00bf\tConduct periodic assessments of our operations to ensure and reduce risks.\r\n\u00bf\tImplement progressive health, safety, and environmental practices that apply risk management and loss control principles to our operations.\r\n\u00bf\tEstablish safety, health, and environmental performance goals and assign responsibilities for developing and implementing"

PCS conducts a PHA on any process involving an OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substances. The scope of each PHA includes: 1) hazards of the process, 2) identification of any previous accident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, 3) Engineering and administrative controls, 4) Consequences of failure of controls, 5) facility location, 6) human factors, 7) qualitative evaluation of the effects on all work place employees, 8) risk ranking matrix, 9) Environmental impact, 10) RMP review. The PHA team will write the analysis findings and all suggestions are be considered by management based on risk ranking.\r\n\r\n3.4\tOperating Procedures:\r\n\r\nPCS has developed operating procedures that provide operating instructions for each part of the process from the introduction of raw material to the shipment of finished product. The operating procedures give detailed step by step operating instructions for each part of the process during: 1) Initial startup, 2) Normal operation, 3) Temporary operation, 4)"

Each new employee is given a comprehensive orientation training program and a basic job specific training covering their job duties and responsibilities as they relate to both normal and abnormal operating conditions. Each employee must demonstrate the required skills to perform their job upon completion of training and must be certified and proficient in performing the duties of their assigned jobs.\r\n\r\n3.6\tContractor Safety:\r\n\r\nPCS developed a contractor program in accordance with 40 CFR 68.87 and 29 CFR 191.119. This program outlines the entrance requirements a contractor, sales person, visitor, consultant, vendor or service company must abide by in order to perform work at the facility.  The Contractor program also details the PCS and contractor responsibilities for the training required for contractors working on-site and procedures for periodic evaluation of contractor safety performance.\r\n\r\n3.7\tPre-Start up Review:\r\n\r\nPCS conducts a pre-start up review prior to the introduction of any OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substance to ensure that new process facilities or modifications to original equipment, controls or safety interfaces of a covered process or covered system do not create a hazard to the facility personnel, civilian population surrounding the facility or the environment. The review is also intended to ensure that hazards identified in the PHA have been properly addressed by design or procedural changes.\r\n\r\n3.8\tMechanical Integrity:\r\n\r\nThe mechanical integrity program establishes and implements the maintenance and inspection programs to ensure the mechanical integrity and reliability of fixed equipment, plant piping, rotating equipment,"

The maintenance and inspection program includes, but may not be limited to, pressure vessels, non or low-pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping and piping components, pumps, pressure safety relief valves and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls (including monitoring devices and sensors, alarms, and interlocks). This program encompasses preventive and predictive maintenance of plant equipment, calibration and testing of instruments and electrical equipment, and routine inspections for plant equipment and piping.\r\n\r\n3.9\tHot Work Permits:\r\n\r\nThe Safety Work Permit System establishes the safest, most useable method of providing all personnel, with procedures to consistently apply when performing work at sites under the PCS jurisdiction. The Safety Work Permit system is broken down into 8 types of permits. 1) Confined Space- Attendants Permit, 2) Confined Space Entry Permit, 3) General Safe Work Permit, 4) Line Breaking Permit, 5) Hot Work Permit, 6) Electrical Permit, 7) Excavation, 8) Vehicle Entry. The requirements of each of the permits can be found in the PCS Nitrogen Safety Manual section 11.0.\r\n\r\n3.10\tManagement of Change:\r\n\r\nThis process ensures that all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than replacement in kind are identified and are reviewed by qualified personnel prior to their implementation. Except in emergencies, such changes are approved in writing prior to their implementation. This review process ensures that additional risks are not introduced, all changes are documented, existing procedures are updated, new procedures are written as required, all process safety information is updated, and that all employees that are affected by the change are properly trained.\r\n\r\n3.11\tIncident Investigation:\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the Incident Investigation management system are to: 1) Carefully analyze an"

The Primary objectives of EMPs are protection of life and elimination or reduction of harm to the public, employees, contractors, and the environment. Secondary objectives are continued production and delivery of products and services. Response and recovery actions must minimize damage done to facilities, equipment, and both delivery and communication systems.  Training on, and maintenance of, the EMP includes, but is not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tTraining and preparation is performed for all applicable employees,\r\n\u00bf\tSimulated drills are conducted on a regular basis,\r\n\u00bf\tThe facility maintains an Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting of certified emergency personnel.\r\n\u00bf\tCritiques of drills and actual events are conducted.

The audits are conducted by a team of personnel knowledgeable in the process and the RMP and PSM requirements.  A report of the findings of the audit is developed and appropriate responses to each finding of the audit are documented.\r\n\r\n4.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe PCS Nitrogen facility has not experienced any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia (toxic), aqueous ammonia, or flammable gas mixtures that meet the criteria at 40 CFR Part 68.42 within the last five years. \r\n\r\n5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe core elements of the emergency response program are incorporated in the Emergency Management Plan (EMP). The EMP works in conjunction with numerous other plans including Hazardous Materials Response (HAZMAT), Hazard Communications (HAZCOM) and various site-specific plans. The core elements of the EMP are training of personnel, roles and responsibilities, emergency action levels, emergency operations center, exercises and drills, and notification procedures. This comprehensive plan is available to all personnel in the event of an emergency and is discussed in more detail above.\r\n\r\n6.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nPCS continually strives to improve the safety of operations and the impact on the public and the environment.
