Depending upon the complexity of the process system being analyzed, a variety of methodologies can be used. Including, but not limited to the \"HAZOP\" (Hazard and Operability Study) and \"What if\" processes. PCS conducts a PHA on any process involving an OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substances. The scope of each PHA includes: 1) hazards of the process, 2) identification of any previous accident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, 3) Engineering and administrative controls, 4) Consequences of failure of controls, 5) facility location, 6) human factors, 7) qualitative evaluation of the effects on all work place employees, 8) risk ranking matrix, 9) Environmental impact, 10) RMP review. The PHA team will write the analysis findings and all suggestions are be considered by management based on risk ranking.\n\n\n\n3.4    Operating Procedures:\n\n\n\nPCS has developed operating procedures that provide operating instructions for each part of the process from the introduction of raw material to the shipment of finished product.
