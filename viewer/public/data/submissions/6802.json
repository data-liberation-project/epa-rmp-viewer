      "SummaryText": "\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY:  The City of West Palm Beach Water Treatment Plant has\ndeveloped this Risk Management Plan (RMP) in response to section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act\n(CAA). This guidance complies with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)\nRisk Management Program (RMP) regulations, 40 CFR Part 68, and the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nSection 112(r) requires facilities which store certain toxic or flammable chemicals above threshold\nquantities to develop and implement an RMP.  The RMP evaluates the worst case and alternate case\nrelease of these chemicals into the environment and the impact on surrounding human populations\nand environmental receptors.  The worst case release scenario assumes that all of the toxic substance\nwithin a system or process is released at one time.  The alternate case release scenario assumes a\nsmaller, more realistic, release of perhaps one cylinder or container.  The RMP also evaluates the\nfacility's resources to cope with chemical releases and implemented procedures responding to\nchemical releases.  Although this RMP presents worst and alternative case scenarios, it should be\nnoted that there has never been an incident at the City of West Palm Beach Water Treatment Plant\nwhich resulted in any offsite injury to human health or the environment.\n\nThe City's water treatment plant, located at Clear Lake, treats surface water from the Water\nCatchment Area (WCA) and the L-8 Canal.  It provides potable water to the City of West Palm\nBeach, the Towns of Palm Beach and South Palm Beach, and to some unincorporated areas of Palm\nBeach county.  Current water use ranges between 20 and 40 million gallons per day (mgd).  The\nwater plant can treat up to  47mgd, which is expected to be sufficient to meet its future water\ndemands.\n\nThe original water system was developed by Henry Flagler in 1894 to serve the historic Royal\nPoinciana Hotel.

A pro-active\nimprovement program will provide a potable water to meet existing and anticipated regulatory\nstandards.  The three years, $16 million program will upgrade the plant and modify the treatment\nprocess to meet the requirements proposed in the Safe Drinking Water Act. \n\nThe water treatment plant physically and chemically treats raw intake water to produce a potable\nwater which meets standards of the Safe Drinking Water Act. \n\nChlorine is the only chemical used at this facility at quantities above the EPA - List of Regulated\nToxic Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention, and thus chlorine is\nthe basis of this RMP.   The maximum amount of liquid chlorine onsite at any one time is 36,000\npounds.  Chlorine cylinders are stored in a state of the art chlorine building with a computerized leak\ndetection system and a chlorine leak scrubber system.  If a leak develops inside the building the leak\ndetection system sends an alarm to the control room and activates the scrubber system.  All vents and\nlouvers in the building automatically close.  The air within the building is drawn through the scrubber\nsystem which neutralizes the chlorine gas with a sodium hydroxide solution.  Chlorine is used in the\ntreatment process to produce potable water.  Chlorine is added to the water as a disinfectant to kill\npathogenic bacteria.  During normal operations six (6) one ton (2,000 pounds) chlorine containers\nare in use at one time plus six (6) containers are on standby with container valves closed, and six (6)\nare in storage. The chlorine is stored in the containers as a liquid under pressure but is discharged into\nthe water as a gas. \n\nChlorine is one of the chemical elements and is one of the halogens.  Neither the gas nor the liquid\nis explosive or flammable, however, both react chemically with many"

      "SummaryText": " substances. Chlorine is a\nhazardous chemical that can cause severe injury or death if released to the atmosphere. Chlorine gas\nis primarily a respiratory irritant. In sufficient concentrations, the gas irritates the mucous membranes,\nthe respiratory system and skin. At higher levels there is vomiting associated with labored breathing. \nIn extreme cases difficulty in breathing may increase to the point where death can occur from\nsuffocation.\n\nChlorine is also hazardous to the environment.  Chlorine causes bleached spots on leafy plants due\nto an attack on chlorophyll in the leaf. Mammalian animals suffer many of the same effects as humans\nexposed to chlorine, and many forms of aquatic animal life are adversely affected by chlorine in\nconcentrations well below 0.1 ppm, but harmful concentrations are unlikely unless chlorine is\ndischarged directly into water.\n\nWorst Case Scenario - The worst case scenario is based upon a complete release of the entire\nquantity of a toxic substance within the largest vessel. The worst case scenario at the Water\nTreatment Facility is based on a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine. This scenario assumes a release\nof one (1) container in a duration of 10 minutes (EPA Standard).  The predicted wind speed is 1.5\nmeters per second (EPA Standard). Passive mitigation is calculated in the equation.  However, active\nmitigation is not allowed in this scenario.  The passive mitigation is the concrete chlorine building. \nBased on these assumptions, if a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine occurred, the toxic endpoints\nwould extend 0.9 miles from the source of the release.  A toxic end point is the distance the released\ngas would travel, assuming all of the released gas moves in the same direction, and still cause\nnoticeable health effects. If  this release did occur, the contamination zone would depend upon wind\ndirection and speed. At this facility the prevailing winds are out of the southeast.

The Environmental Protection Agency RMP Comp version 1.06 computer software was used\nto calculate the toxic endpoint.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario - The alternative case scenario is based on a partial release of a toxic\nsubstance from a system or process.  This type of release may result from a ruptured container,\nruptured seal, or broken valve.  This alternate case scenario is based on a release of 2,000 lbs. (one\ncontainer) of chlorine under the following conditions: 1 inch rupture in the container (diameter of\nvalve opening); container is under 35 psi (Chlorine Institute Inc. standard); the container temperature\nis 77x F (average ambient temperature);  release duration is 34 minutes (time to completely empty\ncontainer); and wind speed is 3 meters per second (EPA Standard).   Both active and passive\nmitigation are equated in the alternate scenario.  The scrubber system (active) mitigates 99.3% of the\nchlorine during a release.  The sealed chlorine building is the passive mitigation in this scenario. \nUnder these conditions the distance to the toxic end is 0.1 miles (528 feet). The human population\nwithin the 0.1 mile radius around the facility is 120 individuals (based on 1990 census).  There are\nno public or environmental receptors inside the 0.1 mile radius.

Numerous\nprecautions are taken at the Water Treatment Plant to prevent the accidental release of chlorine gas\ninto the atmosphere, and to minimize the consequences if a release does occur.  \n\nChlorine Containers -    The chlorine is stored and discharged from one ton capacity containers.

The fusible metal is designed to\nyield or melt between 158x F and 165x F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in\ncase of a fire or other exposure to high temperature.\n\nChlorine System - The system has process controls, a mitigation system, and a monitoring and\ndetection system.
