Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Wellman Farm Center, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Information: The primary activity at the site is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop propduction nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 323,935 pounds in two storage tanks of 12,000 gallons each and fifty nurse tanks of 1000 gallons each.\n\n3. Worst and Alternative Case Scenarios: The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 51,000 pounds which represents the volume of that tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion (a point at which the concentration of ammonia is 200 parts per million, ppm) is estimated to be 1.75 miles. The Alternative Case Scenario is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic shutoff valve stops its flow. The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is estimated to be 1.2 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, 29 CFR 1910.111 of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused death, injuries or significant property damage, nor to our knowledge have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage of environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
