If an emergency were to occur, it is the policy to notify the Los Angeles County Fire Department and request that they respond.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility is operated by the County of Los Angeles, Department of Health Services. We provide adulatory treatment for persons recovering from substance abuse. Propane is used for heating, hot water and cooking in the daily support of the residents of the facility. The system consist of three (3) propane tanks with the largest being 5,000-gallons with associated piping, valves, burners, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario: Our worst-case scenario is failure of the 5,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% @ 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's look-up tables, the greatest distance to the endpoint is 0.2 miles. This explosion would only have an effect on the client population served by our facility at the endpoint, with a total population of 200.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and che"
