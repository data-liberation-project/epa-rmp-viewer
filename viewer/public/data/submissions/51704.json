      "SummaryText": "The BP America ? Naperville Campus (Naperville Campus), located at 150 West Warrenville Road, Naperville, IL 60563, is a multi-building facility dedicated to the research and development of new products, techniques and processes; the improvement of current products and uses; the resolution of customer technical problems; and commercial business support. The 700 Tank Farm at the Naperville Campus is being reactivated for storage of petroleum products and, although unlikely, has the potential to exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for butane and pentane.\n\nThe 700 Tank Farm has 18 total (17 stainless steel and 1 carbon steel) aboveground storage tanks with a maximum holding capacity of 58,800 gallons. The worst-case scenario performed, based on the TNT Equivalency Method presented in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure will not reach a public or environmental receptor.\n\nBP maintains an emergency response plan ? which includes 700 Tank Farm emergencies ? that is reviewed periodically to identify potential plan updates recommended to improve site safety. Since the 700 Tank Farm has not been in service during the last 5 years, no accidental releases of regulated flammable substances have occurred. The site coordinates emergency response activities with the City of Naperville and the DuPage County?s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. The site also maintains compliance with the annual chemical inventory filing requirements of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act program."
