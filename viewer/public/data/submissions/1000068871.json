The refrigeration system runs almost year-round to keep cooler room temperatures for product quality.  However due to seasonal changes sometimes the system is pumped down and shut off due to no product available.\r\n\r\nThe facility is in Sutter County on a contiguous property. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the cooler refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system is a direct mechanical refrigeration system. The Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers Capital Group LLC. facility was constructed in three stages.  The stages started in 1997, then in 2003 and the final building stage occurred in 2006 with minor changes made in 2016 and 2017.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia equipment is in the machine (engine) room, outside on the"

In addition, the House System is separated by walls and distance. Furthermore, as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate.

First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \r\n\r\nSecond, all Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers Capital Group LLC. employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.

Various other safety programs and procedures are included.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nAll employees who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the SDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and the individual's role in the emergency response plan or action plan.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe purpose of the Mechanical Integrity program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.   Inspections, and ongoing maintenance based on industry standards are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief/vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps etc.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThe Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review\r\nPre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems and should be considered outside of the management of change proc"

This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo ensure that all the other areas of program are followed, the regulations require compliance audits.  At a minimum, these must be completed every three years.  The last two audits are kept on file.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nAn incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated within 48-hours of an incident using a team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Employee Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community.  As a rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM program, including taking part in the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\r\n\r\nHot Work and Safe Work Practices\r\nThis permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area.  Permits indicate t"

The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\r\n\r\nContractors and Contractor Qualifications\r\nThis site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids. \r\n\r\nA-5   FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere were no reportable ammonia releases at this facility during the last 5 years that meet the definition of a reportable accident according the program regulations.\r\n\r\nA-6   EMERGENCY ACTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis facility has trained personnel to implement the Emergency Action Plan developed for Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers Capital Group LLC. for flammables, fire, earthquake, hazardous materials and other emergencies. \r\n\r\nFacility personnel shall coordinate with responding outside agencies such as fire and Sutter County Environmental Health. The facilities emergency action plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies. \r\n\r\nThe facility can coordinate with outside parties through drills and attendance at Ammonia Safety Days. Facility personnel will exchange data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency.  In addition, Fire Department personnel should tour the facility frequently to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release.\r\n\r\nDetailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responders and company personnel.  All areas (zones) can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel/contract"

Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \r\n\r\nThe emergency action plan for all releases is to gain access to the shutdown valves and controls for the system with the release.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches and controls are identified at the facility.  \r\n\r\nOn-site personnel do not enter an atmosphere above the Cal/OSHA IDLH which is 300 ppm for ammonia.  Incidental responders are trained to retreat at 25 ppm and don respirators for re-entry.  Facility personnel will assist outside agencies in a plant advisory role during larger releases or atmospheres exceeding the IDLH unless the release can be controlled defensively to reduce the level to less than the IDLH. All personnel not trained to respond will evacuate to the meeting areas and be accounted for.\r\n\r\nA-7   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nEmployees, community safety, the environment and product care are primary concerns.  An initial PHA study was conducted at Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers Capital Group LLC. and the study team made recommendations for additional safety which have been incorporated into the original design.  \r\nThe following is a list of recommendations which will help to improve overall safety.  The recommendations shall be tracked to completion.\r\n\r\nRank\tItem\tRecommendations\r\nB\t1.02-\tCalibrate and test all safeties annually\r\nB\t5.02-\tInstall remote notification system for alarms and failures.\r\nB\t10.06-\tAdd monthly bump testing for hand held monitors.
