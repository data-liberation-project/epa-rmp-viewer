      "SummaryText": "The Hillsborough County Water Department (HCWD) has an accidental release prevention policy intergrating technology, established procedures and management practices into an unified approach to risk management.  The HCWD operates a number of water and wastewater treatment facilities throughout unincorporated Hillsborogh County.  The plants adhere to all applicable policies and procedures of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Florida Department of Community affairs.  Each facility is in compliance  with the EPA emergency response program requirements.\n\nFalkenburg AWT\n\nThe Falkenburg AWT is located at 102 North Falkenburg Road, Tampa, Fl  33619.  The site is immediately west of the intersection of Woodberry and Falkenburg Roads.  In addition to the treatment facility, the complex includes wastewater transmission facilities and reclaimed water facilites.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios identified as worst case release and alternative scenario.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the owner or operator  shall assume that the? maximum quantity in the largest vessel? is released as a gas over ten minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is identified as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nFor modeling, the HCWD utilized the EPA lookup tables.\n\nThe worst case scenario at Flkenburg AWT involves an unspecified failure of a single one ton chlorine container.  The offsite consequence analysis was performed for two sets of meterological conditions. The EPA specified conditions assume the release of the entire amount as a gas in ten minutes, use of the one hour ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint and the consideration of the population residing within a full circle with the radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to f"

      "SummaryText": "acilitate the performance of offsite consequence analysis. The Hillsborough County Water Department believes the EPA assumptions to be unrealistic.\n\nA.  Only a fraction of the compressed liquified chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes to a vapor.  The remaining liquid forms liquid droplet aerosols.  This resultrs in the formation of a dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristics siginificantly different than a cloud of pure chlorine gas.\n\nB.  Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected. The plume area, or footprint, is approximatley six percent of the area of the full circle.\n\nEPA-mandated meterological conditions, Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/second, highest daily maximum temperature and average humidity were used for the modeling.\n\nMitigation systems to be considered include chlorine leak detection system and the use of a vacuum system in the chemical feed process. The Falkenburg vacuum feed system is expected to significantly reduce the amount of chlorine released in case of a pigtail or piping failure.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nThe HCWD general release prevention program is based on several key factors.\nTraining of Staff.\nPreventative maintenance program.\nState of the art process and safety equipment.\nAccurate, effective operating procedures.\nHazard review of equipment and procedures.\nIn house inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the availabililty of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) worn by operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide containers; awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide detection systems. The facility also maintains chemical appropriate repair kits on site."
