J-W Pipeline Company will submit the Executive Summary to a central point as specified by the Environmental Protection Agency. \n\n\t1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (40 CFR \t\t\t68.155(a)) \n\nJ-W Pipeline Company\u00bfs accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices.  Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  J-W Pipeline Company\u00bfs emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and complies with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nJ-W Pipeline Company\u00bfs spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n\t1.2 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\nThe primary activity at J-W Pipeline\u00bfs Sweetwater Creek Facility, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, is the handling and storage of natural gas liquids (NGL).  As part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are stored on site, and sold to a petroleum refiner.  The flammable regulated chemical mixture at the Facility is Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include ethane, propane, isobutene, N-butane, isopentane and N-pentane.  These regulated flammable chemicals have a regulated threshold"

The maximum inventory of NGL is two 60,000-gallon bulk storage tanks, which contains an average 270,000 lbs. of regulated flammable chemicals each.\n\n\t1.3 Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario (40 CFR 68.155)) \n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA was applied using the RMP-COMP model approach to perform worst-case release scenario (WCRS) and alternative release scenario (ARS).\n\nThe WCRS submitted for Program 3 flammable substances assumed the release was the total quantity of one 60,000-gallon bulk storage tank which forms a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits, and the cloud detonates.  For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) for vapor cloud explosions. \n\nUsing the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure the distance to the endpoint indicated that the Facility has offsite consequences from the WCRS.  \n\nAfter considering possible ARSs, a release involving a pool fire of the NFL condensate from a failure of a 2-inch steel pipe connected to the NGL bulk storage tank was selected.  The ARS distance to endpoint for the above-described release was calculated at 0.2 miles from the facility.  \n\nUsing the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure the distance to the endpoint indicated that the Facility has no offsite consequences from the ARS.  \n\n\t1.4 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific \t\t\tPrevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\nJ-W Pipeline Company has taken he necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR 68.  This Facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations as listed in the RMP.

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\t\t1.4.2 Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with regulated substances, J-W Pipeline Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is reviewed as needed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.  \n\n\t\t1.4.3.
