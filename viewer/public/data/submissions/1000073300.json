Introduction\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 112r, a study was conducted to determine the possible impact of a chlorine release on the community surrounding the Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant. In August 2013 the study was revisited to identify any changes that might impact the outcome of the scenarios ran in 2008. If a worst case scenario were to occur at the plant, a 2.54 square mile area East North East of the plant, both inside and outside the town limits of Hillsborough, could be impacted.

Local topography, vegetation and adjacent surface waters in the vicinity of the plant would mitigate a release to a significant degree.\r\n\r\nII.\tPurpose\r\n\r\nThe modeling study conducted in 2008 has been re-evaluated to determine if there would be any change in the impact on the surrounding community of a chlorine release at the Town of Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant.\r\n\r\nIII. \tObjectives\r\n\r\nSection 112r of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment requires that a site with a listed hazardous substance above a stated threshold quantity must develop a Risk Management Program (RMP).  Chlorine (CAS # 7782-50-5) is a listed hazardous substance, which is presently stored and used in amounts above the threshold quantity at the Town of Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant. The town currently has two one-ton cylinders, one in use and the other in reserve. This means that no more than 4,000 pounds of chlorine are on site at any given time.\r\n \r\n       There are several elements in a RMP, including a prevention program identical to OSHA's (Process Safety Management Program) and an Emergency Response Plan.  One element is the requirement for an \"Offsite Consequence Analysis.\"  This analysis is achieved by utilizing a modeling study to determine the geographic and demographic impact of two types of releases: a \"worst case\" scenario and an \"alternative release\" (more probable) scenario.\r\n\r\nIV.\tMethods, Process and Procedures \r\n\r\nFour computer software programs were utilized for this modeling study.  The modeling program RMP*Comp, calculated the potential toxic endpoint of a chlorine release.  CAMEOfm, ALOHA and MARPLOT programs developed by NOAA, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\r\n\r\nOrange County GIS and the LandView 6 publication provided the mapping and database extracts from the Environmental Protec"

Additionally they were used to identify sensitive locations, such as schools, churches, daycares and rest homes in the study area.\r\n\r\nCAMEOfm, ALOHA and the MARPLOT mapping applications were used to determine and depict the geographical extents of the potential chlorine gas plume that may result from a release at the Town of Hillsborough's Water Treatment Plant.  This depiction is in the form of a plotted footprint of the plume on the map.  These programs will remain a tool in the Town of Hillsborough's resources for future planning and response.  \r\n\r\nV.     Census Data\r\n\r\nThe 2010 U.S. Census Data was used by the LandView6 program and is presented utilizing the Block Group Uniform Population Density Method.  This method tallies data for each block group polygon that has any portion of the polygon falling within the radius of the circle, but then prorates the results based on the ratio of the area of the circle to the land area of the block group polygons.  This is done to account for the fact that there will be block groups on the circumference of the circle that are only partially within the radius and therefore their population counts need to be apportioned accordingly.  This method assumes a uniform population density throughout the block groups' land area within the circle. It may have resulted in an over count as the circle includes areas where no people live, such as over water and undeveloped areas.  An undercount for those block groups whose area is only partially inside the radius but whose population is concentrated in the area inside the radius is less likely to be the case as the developed block groups are fairly uniform in this area.  \r\n\r\n\r\nVI.

Typically, there will be one (1) one-ton (2,000 lb) cylinder of chlorine connected to the chlorine system.  One (1) one-ton spare cylinder will be on standby.   All of the chlorine cylinders are stored under cover with one side open to the atmosphere.  The enclosure is secured by a gated fence across the opening with a metal shield to protect and conceal tanks from the street. \r\nThere have been no incidents involving the storage and use of Chlorine at this site in the last 5 (Five)years.\r\n\r\nVII.   Environmental Setting\t\t\r\n\r\n     (a)\tTopography & Surface Water\r\n\r\nThe local topography surrounding a facility will have an effect on any chlorine released.  The RMP*Comp, the computer modeling program used for this study, does not take into account local topography when calculating the release endpoint.  The Hillsborough Water Treatment plant is located in a low area adjacent to the Eno River.  The topography at the site slopes moderately upward to the north and northeast. The river which runs north to south with a turn to the East about a third of a mile before the plant then east from there on, is bounded by the Occoneechee Mountain to the South and Southeast.  The northern banks of the Eno River are located approximately 477 feet southwest, 630 feet south and 970 feet southeast and 25 to 30 feet topographically down gradient from the plant.  The plant's elevation is approximately 544 feet above mean sea level.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n (b)  Vegetation\r\n\r\nThe Town of Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant is located in a fairly well-vegetated area adjacent to the Eno River.

An endpoint of 3 parts per million (ppm) was used to define the boundaries of the toxic clouds formed by the modeled scenarios.  This end point concentration was fixed by the Environmental Protective Agency (EPA) as part of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment.\r\n\r\n      (a)  Worst Case Scenario\r\n\r\nFor the \"Worst Case\" scenario, the EPA requires that the largest vessel in the system lose its contents in 10 minutes.  At the Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant, this requirement equates to a full one-ton cylinder of chlorine, stored outdoors, emptying its contents in 10 minutes.  This was the basis chosen for the \"Worst Case\" scenario at the site.\r\n\r\nThe inputs used for the \"worst case\" scenario modeling were as follows:\r\n\r\nChemical Released - Chlorine\r\nAmount Released - 200 pounds/minute for 10 minutes (2,000 lbs total)\r\nWind Speed - 3.4 miles/hour\r\nWind Direction 0 From the Southwest\r\nTemperature - 77 degrees F\r\nRelative Humidity - 50%\r\nCloud Cover - 5 tenths\r\nStability Class - F\r\nGround Roughness - Urban\r\nMitigation - Some (release to indoor atmosphere inside plant)\r\nEndpoint - 3 parts per million\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modeling results at this point show that a \"worst case\" scenario release could have a moderately significant impact on the surrounding area, depending on the wind direction.  For the \"worst case\" scenario, a chlorine cloud can impact the surrounding area up to a distance of 0.9 miles.

The river is bordered to the south and east by the Eno Mountain which protects a good portion of the town from any release of this nature. Public receptors located within and near the potential impact zone include Residences, Churches and Business within the impact zone and Central Elementary School at .98 miles, Hillsborough Elementary School at 1.16miles just outside the zone northwest of the plant.  Also adjacent to the site are the town's motor pool and public works buildings.

The majority of the impact zone steadily gains in elevation as you travel northwest from the plant. The potentially impacted area is shown on the map included in this report as figure 1.\r\n\r\nIn reality, however, the effects of local topography, vegetation and adjacent surface waters (see Section 4.0 of this report) will mitigate the impacts of a release at this site to a significant degree.  Chlorine is classified as a heavier-than-air gas, and as such tends to naturally flow downhill towards\r\nlow lying areas.  In a little to no wind situation at the plant, a chlorine release would tend to flow east through dense vegetation, downhill and along the Eno River, it may remain in or around the water until it dissipates.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 is a MARPLOT image which depicts the potential geographical extent of the probable chlorine plume resulting from a \"worst case\" scenario release with a 3.4 mph wind from the southwest.\r\n\r\n      (b)   Alternative Case Scenario\r\n\r\nFor the \"alternative case\" scenario, a 180-pound release was chosen.

The 180 pound release is based upon a hypothetical vapor leak that can occur at a pigtail or a valve.  The site's safety experience with managing chlorine has been excellent.  As a result, the 180-pound release was judged to be representative of a significant chlorine vapor leak and was used for the alternative case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe model inputs used for the \"alternative case\" scenario were:\r\n\r\nChemical Released - Chlorine\r\nAmount Released - 3 pounds/minute for 60 minutes (180 lbs total)\r\nWind Speed - 10 miles/hour\r\nWind Direction - From the Southwest\r\nTemperature - 77 degrees F\r\nRelative Humidity - 50%\r\nCloud Cover - 5 tenths\r\nStability Class - D\r\nGround Roughness - Urban\r\nMitigation - Some (release to semi enclosed structure)\r\nEnd point - 3 parts per million\r\n\r\nFor the \"alternative case\" scenario above, the potential endpoint was calculated to be less than one-tenth of a mile (<176 yards) from the release point.  The potentially impacted area is shown on the map included in this report as Figure 3.  Census Block data (see Section 2.3 of this report for limitations) indicates that there would be 6 residences and plant workers potentially affected.

      "SummaryText": "release during uncharacteristically strong winds contrary to the prevailing wind direction in the area of the Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant could have an impact on the surrounding community.  In the unlikely event that a major chlorine release occurs, the Town of Hillsborough's Emergency Response Plan will be initiated to address the actions required by the emergency response organizations to protect the community.\r\n\r\nThe Town's Emergency Response Plan for the Water Treatment Plant addresses communications with neighboring residents in the event of a release that may result in exposure to chlorine gas and/or chlorine odor.  Notification to the population possibly affected by a chlorine emergency will be facilitated through the town's CodeRed Emergency Notification System. This system is designed to call the resident's phone and will broad cast a message recorded by the staff member responsible for launching the call.  Specific instructions for \"Sheltering-in-Place\", \"Evacuation\" (to include evacuation routes), and alternate means to receive information concerning shelter locations and \"All-Clear\" information will be given at that time.  The County of Orange has the same system covering the area giving some redundancy.  Other means that will be used is the EAS (Emergency Alert System) through local Radio, TV stations and the National Weather Service.  Local News station broadcast may preempt programming in an effort to get the word out.\r\n\r\nAny release of chlorine that triggers an emergency response will initially be handled by the Orange Rural Fire Department, Hillsborough Fire Marshal/Emergency Management Coordinator, Hillsborough Police Department and Orange County Emergency Services. The primary responding agency will be that of the Orange Rural Fire Department who protects the town under a contractual agreement. The department is trained to the Haz-Mat Operations Level and will function under the Incident Command System.  Our mutual aid partners providing sp"

Most of the west and central Hillsborough neighborhoods are located in close proximity to the impact zone.  Downtown Hillsborough should not be affected, as the estimated impact zone is located over 1/2 mile to the west of the city center.  2 elementary schools were identified as concerns due to their close proximity to the projected worst case plume.   Additionally, a small number of businesses and approximately 1,300 people may be located within this 0.9-mile radius.\r\n\r\nThe probability of a \"worst-case\" scenario is extremely low.  The staff at the water treatment plant has an excellent safety record in dealing with chlorine. Additionally, the plant has two factors that will positively influence any chlorine release.  First, all chlorine cylinders are located in a strong semi-enclosed building.  This building will retain the chlorine enough to activate the chlorine alarm system giving staff time for evacuation and notification of emergency response personnel.  The location of the"

      "SummaryText": "plant is very favorable to controlling any chlorine release.  The facility is situated in an area adjacent to the Eno River, which is located topographically down gradient from the plant.  Since chlorine is a heavier-than-air gas, it will tend to flow downhill to the river where the chlorine would be consumed by the surrounding trees, vegetation and surface waters.\r\n\r\nIf an \"alternative release\" scenario of 180 pounds in 60 minutes were to occur, the endpoint was calculated to be only one-tenth of a mile or less from the release point.  Only 12 homes are indicated to be within this zone, employees working at the plant and the town's public works and motor pool facility would potentially be affected.  As with the \"worst case\" scenario, local topography, vegetation, adjacent surface waters and prevailing winds from the west should mitigate the effects of a chlorine release at the site.\r\n\r\nThe Town of Hillsborough continues to place a high priority on Process Safety Management at the site which is designed to prevent any accidental release to the environment."
