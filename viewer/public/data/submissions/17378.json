For two minutes prior to the activation of the mitigation systems, and at the rate of 217 pounds per minute, the discharged Titanium Tetrachloride reacts with atmospheric moisture and converts to vaporous Hydrochloric Acid .  The resulting dense vapor plume will travel 0.88 miles off site before reaching its toxic end point of 0.030Mg/L.  In its toxic state, the plume will not reach residential communities, however, industrial sites within about one half mile of the release may be affected.  Active mitigation systems include both remotely controlled and loading-site emergency shutoff mechanisms that are designed to stop the discharges, an emergency alarm to alert employees and other nearby industrial sites, and a suppression dense-foam system to blanket the containment dike and prevent the chemical from reacting with atmospheric moisture and converting to Hydrochloric Acid.  Fire water monitors can create a water-mist barrier capable of reducing the amount of released Hydrochloric Acid that is capable of drifting off site. \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nPROPYLENE\n\nA Propylene storage tank ruptures, 10,000 pounds of liquefied Propylene is decompressed  and converts to a vapor cloud.  The vapor cloud ignites, explodes, and propagates a pressure wave (blast) greater than 1 psia, for a radius of 915 feet from the explosion point.  This blast will not reach any residential areas, but may affect industrial sites immediately adjacent to the plant. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nPROPYLENE\n\nA one inch circulation pipeline to the Propylene storage tank ruptures and discharges at 27.5 lb./minute for 5-minutes.

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of recommended improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n1.  Improve dissemination of process safety information to employees.  For each process, an on-line compilation of safety elements will be made available for employee reference.\n\n2.  Contractors will be required to successfully complete the Contractor Safety Program sponsored by the Greater Houston Contractor Safety Council.\n\n3.  Incident Investigation Tracking System will be placed in service.  This will enable on-line access and the creation of specialized reports that may be useful in safety evaluations and the determination of safety program effectiveness.\n\n4.  Select members of the Emergency Response Team will be trained to the advanced level of Hazardous Materials Technician.  Currently, process supervisors meet this standard, while most Team members are trained to the First Responder level.  \t\n\nCERTIFICATIONS\n\nWithin the past five years, each covered process has had no accidental release that caused off site impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent off site impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the covered processes, entry within the distance to the specified end points may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMPlan.  \n\nFor all  covered processes, the undersigned certifies that, to the be"

It is a feed stock for one of our products.  \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical \n\nTITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE\n\nA Titanium Tetrachloride storage tank ruptures and discharges 145,000 pounds of the chemical into a containment dike.  The contained Titanium Tetrachloride reacts with atmospheric moisture and converts to vaporous Hydrochloric Acid.  Stipulated climatic conditions for the Pasadena area include an atmospheric temperature of 95 degrees F, and relative humidity of 90 percent.  Winds will be out of the south-southeast at  4-12 miles per hour.  Under these climatic conditions, the conversion of Titanium Tetrachloride to Hydrochloric Acid occurs at the rate of 217 pounds per minute.  The release lasts for 10 minutes, produces 2,170 pounds of Hydrochloric Acid, and forms a dense vapor plume that reaches its toxic end point of 0.030 mg/L at a distance of 2.5 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nTITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE\n\nA tanker truck unloads TitaniumTetrachloride into a bulk storage tank.  The chemical transfer is through a hose with a two inch diameter.  The transfer hose shears and Titanium Tetrachloride is discharged from each hose segment and from the tank and container to which they are attached.  The discharge spans two minutes and 37"
