      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nA.  Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nThis facility was recently acquired by The Pictsweet Company.  There were existing safety programs in place and an RMP had previously been submitted under the previous Owner.  In an on-going effort to ensure all existing safety programs meet Pictsweets high safety standards, The Pictsweet Company has reviewed all sections of the RMP and is resubmitting a complete RMP.  \n\nThe Pictsweet Company has always had a philosophy that Safety is important to our companys success.  Our primary objectives are to ensure the safety and health of our people and to protect company property. Our goal is to provide our employees with safe and healthful working conditions.  We are very serious about this responsibility.  Our employees also share in the responsibility to protect themselves and fellow workers from injury.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). The purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory of this system is approximately 65,000 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this system could po"

      "SummaryText": "se a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAs RM program. \n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the cooling and freezing of vegetables. Through the use of multiple stages (2) of compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of -40F with the use of low suction booster compressors and provides temperatures of +30F and +45F with the use of intermediate suction compressors.  The higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located outside, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs and relief valves.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents in the past five years.\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an Emergency Action Plan and an Emergency Response Plan to respond to accidental releases.  The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the LEPC for Hildalgo County.\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Pictsweet Company is currently reviewing and updating as needed the existing safety programs at this facility to ensure the safety of employees and to minimize any occurrences of accidental ammonia leaks."
