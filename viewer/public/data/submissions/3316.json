Andres, Co-Plant Manager (316)799-2021 or (316)799-1920.\n\nRisk Management Plan-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\n     Elbing Grain Company is owned and operated by brothers, Edwin H. Andres and Irvin R. Andres and their two sons, Steven D. Andres and Ricky L. Andres.  They have a full time bookkeeper and a parttime bookkeper.  As owners/operators, the Andres family is committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anydrous ammonia and  to the safety of the persons living in their community.  Steven D. Andres is a volunteer firefighter with the local fire department, The Whitewater Fire Department, and has had training in hazardous materials (HazMat) handling.  He fully understands the dangers of an accidental release of anlydrous ammonia and has conveyed his concerns to the fire department.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     Elbing Grain is a retail outlet for agricultural products including animal feed, animal health products, seed, fertilizer,  and herbicides.  In addition, it receives and ships out grain including Wheat, Soybeans, and Milo.\n\n     Anydrous ammonia is a part of the fertilizer sales program.  The anhydrous ammonia plant consists of two above ground non-refrigerated tanks; a 30,000 gallon tank, and a 12,000 gallon tank.  The two tanks are interconnected with pipes for vapor exchange and the movement of liquid, however, the tanks are used separately.  Two vapor exchange pumps are used to move liquid from a storage tank to 1,000 galllon mobile tanks for farm use.\n\n     Andyrous ammonita is received via tank trucks and unloading is accomplished by a liquid pump on the tank truck, pumping into a storage tank through the liquid lines.  A vapor exchange line is used to equalize pressure between the storage tank and tank truck to prevent overpressurization.  There is a riser for unloading railroad tank cars but it has been plugged "

The worst-case scenario\n\n     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank, 30,000 gallons or 140,196 pounfds which represents 85% capacity as limited by ddesign standards.  The release rate would be 14019.6 pound per minute for a 10 minute duration.  Estimated wind speed at 1.5 meters/second and the distance to endpoint would be 1.63 miles.  Given the built in safety of excess flow valves, in our opinion, there are only two instances where the worst case scenario could occur:  A tornado or a train derailment on the Union Pacific Railroad, 75 feet from the plant.\n\n4.  Alternative release scenario\n\n     The most likely potential for an alternative release would be a break in a transfer hose.  Such a break would release a total of 11,908 pounds at 5954 pounds per minute for 2 minutes.  In this instance the most likely distance to the endpoint is .60 miles.\n\n5.  The accidental release prevention program    \n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Hewalth Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"\n\n6.  The Five year Accident History\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have (a) caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor (b) to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental change.\n\n7.  The Emergency Response Program\n\n     The facility has:\n\n     (a) a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n     (b)provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and commuinity right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n     (c) a written emergency response program, in acco"
