Major components of this section that contribute to the prevention of accidental releases include:  testing of critical control and shutdown instruments, testing of pressure relief valves, and routine testing of piping and vessel corrosion.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 2005, corrosion in an inlet vessel containing unprocessed gas and liquids caused a liquid spill, gas release, explosion, and fire.  The fire burned for approximately two hours, from 4:00 AM to 6:00 AM.  There was no off-site impact.  There were no fatalities, no injuries, no environmental impact except localized on-site soil contamination, and $4.3 million in equipment damage.  As a result of the incident, Fain Gas Plant improved equipment, revised maintenance, revised training, revised emergency response plan, revised operating procedures, implemented new process controls, created new mitigation systems, and changed the process.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program for this facility is contained in the Emergency Response Manual, ERM.  A copy of the ERM has been provided to the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Potter/Randal County.  The ERM includes steps to take in case of an uncontrolled release of hazardous substance.  The initial step would be to contact the Potter/Randall County Emergency Response system which in turn will contact other emergency response agencies to aid in controlling access to the facility by the public.\r\n\r\nThe facility has ongoing programs that help train personnel in areas that have the greatest potential for uncontrolled release of hazardous substances.  In addition to utilizing PSM for hazard assessment, safety training is done in which items are discussed and resolved.\r\n\r\nSummary for incident dated March 6, 2018\r\n\r\nThe following summary is intended to meet the requirements of 40 CFR Subpart"

      "SummaryText": "l release prevention measures taken are outlined in the mechanical integrity section of the PSM program for the facility.  Major components of this section that contribute to the prevention of accidental releases include:  testing of critical control and shutdown instruments, testing of pressure relief valves, and routine testing of piping and vessel corrosion.\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 2018 due to undetermined causes, inlet compressor building GMV 1-6 experienced a fire on compressor #4. The fire started at approximately 9:30 pm and burned for about 6 hours, until fuel sources were eliminated and excess fuel was used up. There was no off-site impact.  No injuries or fatalities occurred, no impact to the environment.  Damage to equipment and facilities was estimated to be $9 million. As a result of this incident, this compressor building and related equipment was abandoned in place and removed from service.  Revisions were made in regards to emergency response procedures, training has been revised, and changed process for compressing inlet gas coming into facility.\r\n\r\nThe emergency action program for this facility may be found in the Emergency Action Plan, EAP. An updated copy of the EAP has been shared with the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Potter/Randall Counties.  Steps have been included to take in the event of an unplanned/uncontrolled release of hazardous materials.  The initial step would be to contact the Potter/Randall Emergency Response system which will begin the process of contacting other emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nThe facility has ongoing programs that help train personnel in areas that have the greatest potential for uncontrolled release of hazardous substances.  In addition to utilizing PSM for hazard assessment, safety training is done in which items are discussed and resolved."
