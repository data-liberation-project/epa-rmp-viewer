The plant is surrounded by light industrial and residential areas. We develop new synthetic rubber products that will ultimately be manufactured on a commercial scale at our facilities in Texas and Louisiana. These products include styrene-butadiene and polybutadiene rubber used in vehicle tires, plastics modification, adhesives, asphalt modification, and other products.\n\n\n\nOne of the chemicals we use as a raw material brings us under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule. This is 1,3-butadiene, identified as a flammable substance under the RMP rule. We have long had in place the types of accident prevention programs and emergency contingencies required by this rule and continue to believe that effective safety and environmental practices are an integral aspect of sustainable business.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\n\n\nIt is Firestone's policy to meet or exceed all safety, health and environmental regulations and industrial standards that apply to our facility. We put significant resources into compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management and related OSHA standards, and have expanded our programs to meet the specifics of the EPA RMP Rule. These programs help maintain low levels of risks to our workers, contractors, the public, and the environment. This is achieved through a two-tier approach of defense-in-depth: (1) Minimize the possibility of serious plant upsets through engineering and procedural safeguards and(2) Thoroughly plan contingencies in coordination with local responding agencies. \n\n\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nOur commitment of resources to our Process Safety Management (PS"

Each program is intended to be used in combination with each other to help prevent unwanted deviations from normal, daily operations, and to cope with process upsets in a way that minimizes the potential for harm within our fenceline and beyond. Firestone does not consider safety to be a stand-alone practice but, rather, a fundamental element of all aspects of our daily operations, as such:\n\n- Changes in our process operations go through a Management of Change procedure that systematically addresses and resolves the potential safety implications of the change.\n\n- Preventive maintenance on pre-established frequencies is performed on all equipment that plays a role in the prevention or mitigation of process upsets to ensure that it is fully capable of meeting its design intent.\n\n- Based on extensive written procedures, our personnel are trained, periodically retrained, and tested on the proper operations and maintenance of our facility, as well as contingency actions for abnormal conditions.\n\n- We conduct detailed, systematic process hazard analyses to identify what hypothetically could go wrong in the facility and, when warranted, make further plant or procedural improvements.\n\n- Our equipment, instruments, and controls are designed for safety, complying with applicable regulatory and industry standards. Much of our facility is computer-controlled with operator back up, incorporating continual internal checks, emergency shutdowns, and alarms. Outdoor storage vessels at the facility are surrounded by concrete walls (dykes) to mitigate the effects of potential spills.\n\n\n\nOur practices closely reflect the specific nature of the chemicals we use. This includes our operating procedures, maintenance procedures, process designs, and personal protective equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWe have had no events at the Firestone facility that would qualify for inclusion in the RMP 5-year a"

We train all new personnel on the plan, conduct refresher training annually, and keep our personnel aware of any changes to the plan. Our emergency response plan complies with the RMP Rule and other applicable EPA and OSHA requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nContinuous safety improvement at our facility is achieved through day-to-day adherence to our Process Safety Management practices. Our program involves ongoing identification, analysis, and implementation of safety enhancement measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe 1,3-butadiene supply railcar, brought onsite at maximum capacity due to supplier error, was deemed as the vessel with the single largest quantity of 1,3-butadiene. As such, the worst-case release scenario (WCS) is assumed to involve the catastrophic rupture of the 1,3-butadiene railcar, resulting in the release and ignition of the railcar's entire inventory in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). The distance to the endpoint of 1-psi overpressure for this worst-case scenario was estimated to be 0.5 miles. This unlikely scenario is expected to have offsite impacts. \n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP Rule, the chosen alternative-case release scenario (ACS) has an endpoint distance that extends past the facility's fenceline and is also more likely to occur than the facility's chosen WCS. The chosen ACS is guarded against by Firestone's Process Safety Management program. In this hypothetical ARS, the operator is pumping butadiene from a railcar to a storage tank when the transfer hose suddenly ruptures resulting in a spill. This scenario requires a highly reliable safeguard, the excess flow valve on the railcar, to fail to operate as designed, by failing to cut-off "

The released vapor is then assumed to ignite resulting in an explosion. RMP*Comp estimates the potential effects of such an explosion to extend 0.07 miles, reaching our industrial neighbors, but not the general public. The safeguards in place to protect against this scenario are the excess flow valve on the railcar, along with our adherence to relevant National Fire Protection Association standards. Further precautions include performing continual preventive maintenance on the hose, replacing it at prescribed time intervals, and pressure testing it before use to detect a leak should one be imminent. \n\n"
