The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each of its facilities and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and complies with USEPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nJavier Valdez, Water Plant Manager, is the responsible official at the Edinburg West Edinburg Water Treatment Plant. The plant operates on property just west of the Edinburg water storage reservoirs at 1752 South Mon Mack Road, Edinburg, Hidalgo County, Texas. Its chlorination building sits on the east side of the plant and consists of an enclosed room that houses nine (13), 1-ton Chlorine cylinders. The chlorine room is equipped with a leak detector, alarm, fans, a drain, and a scrubber. Personnel oversee the facility 24-hours a day, including daily inspections of the chlorine building. The facility houses emergency air and power supply. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) storage occupies a location at the entrance to the chlorine building,"
