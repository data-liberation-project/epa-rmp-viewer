KM Davies has a refrigerated warehouse that uses 48,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for the refrigerant.  The refrigerant, ammonia, is contained within the closed loop refrigeration system and flows dynamically through the piping system.  The company is 90 + years old, but all of the refrigeration equipment and piping has been purchased new and replaced in the last 25 years.\n\n      Emergency Response plans and procedures have been published and are in place.  The plan details the response for many forms of hazards including ammonia.  The plan was created with input from required regulations, employees and in coordination with local emergency response organizations including fire and ambulance companies, county emergency planning teams, corporate hazmat teams, and law enforcement agencies.  \n\n      Employee training and development and policy evaluation is on-going.  Updates to the plan are made as regulations change and the company becomes aware of better procedures and how they can be implemented.  Several company employees along with several municipal employees through coordinated efforts have received training with hands-on experience and have been certified for emergency response with self contained breathing apparatus and Level A Suits.  Equipment of this nature is owned and maintained by the company.  Suits were updated as recently as Summer 2003.\n      Community training and information meetings which include numerous emergency response teams as well as all neighboring residents and businesses are conducted on an annual basis or as requested.  Community members are notified by writing and personal visit.\n      Preventative maintenance is scheduled and repairs continuous and part of everyday, ongoing operations.\n      Ammonia is toxic in high concentrations.\nThese high concentrations can occur at the point of em"
