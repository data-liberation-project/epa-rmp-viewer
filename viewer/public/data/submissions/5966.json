      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n     We are a janitorial supply and industrial chemical distributor.  We sell chlorine which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n     Our emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  Our plan includes appropriate measures to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  Our facility is included in the community response plan developed under EPCRA.  \n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n     The primary purpose of this facility is to sell and distribute janitorial supplies and cleaning compounds.  The regulated substance handled is chlorine.  Chlorine is delivered by our supplier, Allied Chemical Co., in 150 lb. cylinders fabricated to DOT specification.  The cylinders are unloaded in our warehouse where they are secured and stored in containment racks until they are sold.  Management controls ensure that the total inventory of chlorine stored at our facility will never exceed 7500 lbs.  The potential for release of the chlorine gas is considered by the local emergency planning committee to be low.\n\n3.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n     A 150 lb. chlorine cylinder falls over and shears off the valve.  There is a gas release.  The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/L is .65 mi"
    },
    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 5966,
      "SummaryText": "les.  The model used to determine this distance is EPA's RMP Guidance for Chemical Distributors Reference Tables/Equations.  This has the potential to extend past the facility's boundaries if no active mitigation is considered.\n     Alternative Release Scenario\n     A containment rack holding sixteen 150 lb. chlorine cylinders is crushed by a forklift in such a way as causes vessel leaks in all sixteen cylinders.  Using EPA's RMP Guidance for Chemical Distributors Reference Tables/Equations, the distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/L is .27 miles.  \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n     Our facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history.\n     There have been no accidents at our facility.\n\n6.  The emergency response program\n     Our facility's emergency response plan is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  We are also included in the local emergency response plan and are coordinated with the local fire department.  \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n     Our company is a family owned and operated business.  We have been in business for over 41 years.  As federal and state regulations have changed over the years our company has sought to improve our operations in accordance with EPA and OSHA guidelines as well as all state and local planning requirements.  We have sought outside assistance and training from various sources such as OSHA Consultation Services, The Chlorine Institute, and Allied Chemical Co. and continue to place the safety of our employees and community among our highest priorities."
