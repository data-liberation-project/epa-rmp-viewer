Facility Policy\nThe owners, management and employees of Walnut Creek Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Pottawatamie county LEPC, and other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\nThe primary activity of this facility is to store anhydrous ammonia, for the grower to later apply, for the fertilization of his or her agronomic crop.  The quantity stored ranges up to 192,500 pounds between storage and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 75000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity.  The distance to the end point(point of dipersion, to 283 ppm) is .99 mile.\n\nb.  The alternate release scenario:  The most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a  1 inch transfer hose release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is .30 mile.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia'.  The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administ"

The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see section 8.3 (b).\n\n5. Five Year Accident History.\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia or personal injuries in the last five years.  To my knowledge the has been no off-site damage resluting in death , injury, evacuation, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Action Plan\nThe facility has:\na.  A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb.  Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information are required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety Improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facitlity.  We are implementing new requirements such as:  locking the storage tanks and introducing vehicle barriers around the storage tanks."
