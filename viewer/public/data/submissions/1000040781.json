It receives crude oil from multiple sources, which it processes into petroleum products, including gasoline, transportation fuels, LPG, and oils.  In addition to the flammable materials associated with crude oil processing, the facility uses hydrofluoric acid in the Alkylation Unit, which is a standard refining application.  The processing of the crude oil results in the generation of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur Recovery Units process the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide to recover sulfur for sale and to limit SO2 and CO2 emissions to atmosphere at quantities below the allowable limits.  \n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe federal Risk Management Program requires Phillips 66 Company, Ferndale Refinery (Phillips 66) to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any processes containing regulated substances above threshold quantity (TQ) at the Ferndale Refinery.  The Ferndale Refinery handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.  The facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur.  The RMP formalizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n\n\n\nThe Ferndale Refinery processes oil into gasoline and refining products.  The facility receives oil from many sources via ship or pipeline, stores it in tanks onsite, and then processes the oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, barge or truck.  The refining process separates the crude oil into five products: gasoline, diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), heavy fuel oil and sulfur.  The sulfur is generated because oil contains significa"

The fuel products are stored onsite prior to shipping, and any non-hydrocarbon products (e.g. sulfur) is also stored prior to shipping.  The facility has the utility and support systems required providing for safe operation of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe RMP contains two parts required for submittal:\n\n- RMP Executive Summary, Prevention Program Summary, and Management System Summary\n\n- RMP Data Elements\n\n\n\nThe original 1999 RMP effort at the facility was divided into three phases.  First, the facility determined which processes were covered by the RMP regulation.  The results of this study are published in the report titled \"Phase I: Inventory Determination\" which measured the quantities of regulated substances to determine which processes are subject to RMP.  Next, the facility conducted the required hazard assessment as defined by the regulation.  The hazard assessment modeled accidental release scenarios that provided the refinery with insight into the potential for onsite processes to affect the surrounding community and the environment.  Finally, Phase III of the RMP effort is provided in this document.  It contains the executive summary of the overall RMP effort at the facility, a synopsis of the prevention program, a five-year accident history and summary of the management systems in place to implement and maintain the facility's risk management measures.\n\n\n\nIn June, 2009, the covered refinery processes were divided into separate processing units, the Toxic Worst Case Release Scenario was revised to reflect current operations, stored railcar inventories were added, and another railcar Flammable Alternative Release Scenario was added. \n\n\n\nThe following changes have been made to the RMP submission documents as part of the June 2014 update: \n\n- Revised the equipment included in each covered processes to better align with process flow,\n\n- Revised inventory data based on"

For regulated substances where emergency response planning guidelines (ERPG) values have been established, RMP requires that the ERPG-2 value be used as the toxic endpoint.

The alternative release scenarios allow the facility to present scenarios that assume the use of administrative and actual controls in place at the facility. Even the ARSs are rare events.  The details of the process release conditions assumed for this and other hazard scenarios, and assumptions made, are provided in the Alternative Case Release Scenarios section of the 2014 RMP Update Report. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to compile a 5-Year Accident History for all RMP regulated substances in covered processes at the facility.  As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near-misses that occur within the facility.  This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\n- Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\n\n- Offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\n\n\n\nThe Facility had one RMP reportable incident in 2010.

The Facility is a contributor to the community by protecting the plant and neighbors from damaging effects of emergency situations.  The facility design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization before an accident can occur.  In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond control.  The emergency response plan known as the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), along with training and drills, is designed to prepare the facility to recognize emergency situations of various types and react promptly and correctly to minimize any ill effects.  Local, state, and federal safety rules dictate the facility to study and understand the principles and specifics covered in this preplanning effort and fully understand all roles in the plan.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this emergency plan (ICP) is to provide a cohesive, written procedure for coordinating effective response procedures by all plant personnel in order that danger to employees, contractors, the general public and the environment may be lessened in the unlikely event of an emergency.  The emergency response procedure covers the entire facility, including refinery units that handle or produce regulated substances.  It includes, but is not limited to: first-in response, evacuation, emergency shutdown, decontamination and medical response to chemical exposure, agency notification, public notification if potential for impact, personnel accounting, and clean-up.\n\n\n\nTraining for emergency response is handled through the HSE Department, and is conducted frequently with classroom, tabletop, and live exercises.
