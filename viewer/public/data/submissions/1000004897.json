If an accident or accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with the local responders to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the incident to people and the environment.\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\nA?    The primary activity at this facility is storage of anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer for retail sale to farmers.  \nA?    Product is received into bulk tanks where it is stored until it can be transferred to nurse tanks for field application.\nA?    The maximum quantity stored in the bulk tank is 245,140# in 1 A? 26,000 gallon tank and 1 A? 30,000 gallon tank.  There are 21-1,000 gallon nurse tanks on hand that will hold a total of 17,850gallons (91,928 #).  All calculations are made at 85% full (max allowed by law) to leave room for expansion.  We used 5.15 pounds per gallon as indicated on the Material Safety Data Sheet.\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release\n\nA?    This information has been withheld at the request of the EPA.  \nA?    All distance to endpoint information shall be made available to first responders.  \n\n\nEmergency Planning:\n\nA?    This facility does not have an Emergency Response Plan.  By definition we have an Emergency Action Plan.  This means that employees are trained to recognize the problem, notify first responders, and evacuate all employees.  Employees shall not respond to a release requiring specific training and/or equipment.  \nA?    An employee who is involved with the volunteer fire department is allowed to go off the clock and respond as a member of the local fire department.  \nA?    This facility coordinates with the local responders each year during the submission of Tier II, Community Right-To-Know information.  Local responders will be given the opportunity to tour our facility as needed for training and informational purposes.  \n\n\nAccidents/Incidents:\n\nA?    There have been no accidental releases or "
