The end point is .1 mile or 528 feet away from the water plant.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been started by Marceline water plant to check all epuipment valves and pipes on a regular timetable. All employees at the water plant have been trained in safe handling of chlorine tanks. Such training includes loading and unloading suppliers shipments, connecing and disconnecting tanks, and changing equipment in the plant.\n\nThere has not been any releases of chlorine in the past five years. The main reason for this success is that Marceline water plant has a good prevenitive maintence program and keeps all employees trained in safehandling of chlorine.\n\nThe Emegancy Respronce Program is set up to shut down any leak and to evacute any part of the public that may be in danger of a release of chlorine gas. Marceline water plant has trained the fire department, Local Emergency Planning Cordinator (L. E. P. C.) to help with the shut down of the chlorine systum in the case of an emergency. The Police Department has a map of the release points that would be involved in the worst case scenario, or the alternative scenarios. for evacation of people from the zone on the map. The police would also assit with traffic control. The D. N. R. and D. P. C. (our chlorine supplier), would be called for help. The Hospital in Brookfield Mo.  would be notified of any leak so they would know about and be prepraed for any medical tretments needed. Linn and Chairiton County Ambulance's will be notified.\n\nIn case of a chlorine release the employees of the Marceline water plant and local municipal fire department have been trained in the use of Self Contrained Breathing Apparatiuses (S. C. B. A.). They will shut down any leak to the best of there ability. After the leak has been stoped, the cause will be determned and fixed.\n\nAt this time there no planned changes at the Marcelince water plant Chorline system. Up dates to"

The water plant serves Marceline's population of over 2500 plus the Linn/Chairiton Public Water Supply #3 serving parts of Linn, Chariton and Macon Counties. We are dedicated to supplying quality water and a safe envrionment to all of our customers and employees.\n\nThe City of Marceline water plant is located on road 223, 1/4 mile south of county line rd in Chairiton County on the west side of the road 1/2 way up the hill. The water plant's primary activity is to produce an average of .5 million gallons of water per day, with a total capacity of 2.1 million gallons per day. Th regulated substance that we use at the water plant is chlorine. The water plants uses between 20 and 30 pounds of chlorine a day, and may have up to 4000 pounds of chlorine in inventory at any one time.\n\nThe worst case scanarlo resease of chlorine is a plan that is designed to indicate whether you have your release contained on site or if the release will affect the general public. The guldelines we used to reach the end point of the worst case scenario was the Risk Mamagement Plan's trade mark submitted by E. P. A.\n550-b99-001. Feb. 1999 via the internet at www.epa.gov/ceppo/. The worst case scenarlo release was factored into the program at a win speed of 1.5 m. p. h., tempture of 77 degrees, and a release of 2000 pounds of chlorine at 200 pounds a minute for 10 minutes. The end point of a release is .9 miles.\n\nThe worst case scenarlo release of 2000 pounds of chlorine would be if we had a tornado, earthquake, explosion, vandals, or a fire occurs. All assumptions assume worst case scanarios, which are very unlikely, but could happen.\n\nThe alternative scanario is what could, and may happen someday. We used the same E. P. A. plan to calculate the end point of release of chlorine gas. The mumbers we used .04 pounds released per minute. The time of release 250 minutes. Th"
