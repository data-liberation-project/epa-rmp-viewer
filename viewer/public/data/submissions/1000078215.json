This is accomplished to a great extent by a well developed, up-to-date and implemented Risk Management Program. All HBLCS facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner. It shall be the responsibility of the plant manager to ensure that all procedures are followed as set forth in our Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs. In the unlikely event of an accidental release it is HBLCS policy to immediately call the National Response Center, Local Emergency Response Committee, the local Fire Department and other agency(ies) that may be required. All HBLCS facilities will have an emergency response team to assist these agency(ies).\r\n\r\nHB Lyons Cold Storage, Lyons is a public refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed loop system. Anhydrous ammonia, most commonly known as ammonia, is an excellent refrigerant and is commonly used in most of the world's industrial refrigeration systems. Ammonia has an excellent warning property, its odor. Ammonia's odor is familiar to most people due to the fact that it is commonly used in household cleaning solutions. Ammonia can be detected as low as 5 parts per million (PPM) and has an average life span of 7 days in the environment before it breaks down to its common elements nitrogen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nTypical items stored within HBLCS facilities are raw or processed food items that can be found in your supermarket or local restaurant. Temperatures range between -30 degrees to +45 degrees F. The refrigeration equipment and most of the refrigeration piping are located inside the facility. There are a couple exceptions, the condensers and its related piping are on the machine room roof. The machine room contains most of the large refrigeration machinery and vessels.

The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors throughout to help lessen any leaks that might occur and to provide an early alert.\r\n\r\nHBLCS believes that prevention is foremost.  All of HBLCS facilities are maintained by a staff of trained maintenance personnel. Most of these people are members of the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) and all Chief Engineers are members of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). HBLCS has on staff at the corporate level an OSHA and EPA coordinator/trainer who is a certified OSHA Instructor.  All facilities comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management without regard to the ammonia threshold quantity.  All the vessels and piping have been installed according to ASME vessel and piping codes and applicable local Building, Fire and Mechanical Codes. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nHBLCS Lyons facility has been operating at this location for many years. Within that long history the facility has seen few refrigerant releases. Since June, 1999, this facility has not experienced any accidents or releases from their refrigeration system. \r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for 29 CFR 1910.38-Emergency Action Plan, OSHA's 1910.119, Process Safety Management and 1910.120 HAZWOPER standards. We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nThe Facility has completed a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) recently and has made changes to improve safety. the compliance audit was completed recently as well and there are several areas in which the plant is improving safety."
