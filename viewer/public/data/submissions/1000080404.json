It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Morton County Law Enforcement Center's 911 system and request that the Hebron Fire Department, and the Hebron Ambulance Service respond to our emergency.  Morton County Disaster Emergency Coordinator, Tammy Lapp-Harris, would also be notified.\n\n\n\nThis facility is a Grain Elevator, and we also handle dry fertilizer, and Anhydrous Ammonia for sale to the public.  We own, lease and operate two fertilizer and Anhydrous Ammonia plants, this one which is located 2 miles southwest of Hebron, ND, and another which is located at Hazen,  ND.\n\n\n\nOur worst case scenerio for the Hebron plant, is the pull away breaking 25 ft. section of a 4 in. hose, causing vapor release. According to the EPA's look-up endpoint, there is a 6 mile radius, with a total population of 888, within the distance to the endpoint.  This facility complies with the EPA's accidental prevention rules and all applicable state and local code regulations.  We have never had an accident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused death, injury, property damage, or evacuations.\n\n\n\nThis plant, Anhydrous Ammonia Storage Facility AA-065, is inspected every 5 years by the Department of Insurance of the State of North Dakota, by the Chief Boiler Inspector, and seasonally by our plant supervisor."
