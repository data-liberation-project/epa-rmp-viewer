(Targa) owns and operates a natural gas processing facility, the Edward Gas Plant, in Upton County, Texas.  The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\r\n\r\nThe Edward Gas Plant is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Edward Gas Plant is located near Midkiff, Texas in Upton County. Targa treats the entire gas plant as one process with 1,404,902 lbs of flammable mixtures. The facility operates the process to produce the following petroleum products:\r\n\r\n1.\tY grade mixture from natural gas\r\n2.\tStabilized Condensate\r\n3.\tResidue Gas\r\n\t\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Edward Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 275,399 pounds (60,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in a Natural Gas Liquids Product Surge Tank (V-404).  Using the EPA's RMP COMP Version 1.07 program, the entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud exp"

The rest of the vessels that were evaluated are located within and have a radius smaller than the WCS vessel discussed.  \r\n\r\nThe facility is not located within a populated area; therefore, the WCS would not affect a public receptor and is considered a Program 1 process.  The nearby Benedum Gas Plant is owned by Targa and is therefore not a public receptor despite being located within the WCS distance to endpoint.  A consideration of the 0.5 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Edward Gas Plant is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to aid in accident release prevention.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Edward Gas Plant is a new facility.  There have been no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage during this period.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Edward Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of Targa staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs. However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \r\n\r\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate.
