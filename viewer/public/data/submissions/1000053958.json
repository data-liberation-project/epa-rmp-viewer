      "SummaryText": "ADM - Clinton\n\nRMP Executive Summary \n\n\n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) Corn Processing, Clinton, Iowa to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objectives are to minimize the risk of a denaturant release, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to ADM's employees, the public and the environment.  These objectives will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, maintaining a preventive maintenance program, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary with the Clinton Fire Department, the local emergency response providers.\n\n\n\nEmergency response for this facility is coordinated with the Clinton County Emergency Management Agency, which is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Clinton Fire Department.  Emergency response procedures at this facility include notification of the LEPC in the event of an accident involving denaturant with emergency response provided by the Clinton Fire Department with support by the Davenport Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nB. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nThe ADM-Clinton facility is a corn wet milling processing plant which processes corn into products such as corn sweeteners, fuel and beverage ethanol, corn oil and dry specialty starches.  To produce these products ADM-Clinton uses numerous substances which include denaturant(natural gasoline) that is regulated by the RMP regulations.  Natural gasoline is used as a denaturant in the fuel alcohol.\n\n\n\nADM-Clinton continues to include denaturant (natural gasoline) as used in the production of fuel ethanol, which as mentioned has the listed chemical in it.  The denaturant used at the facility generally has a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating"

However, due to the potential variability in the make-up of this additive, it is possible that ADM will receive material that has a flammability rating of 4.  Therefore, ADM has included provisions in the RMP for managing the denaturant as a precautionary measure.  \n\n\n\nC. Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario for Toxic Chemicals:\n\n\n\nN/A    \n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario #1 for Toxic Chemicals:\n\n\n\nN/A \n\n\n\nWorst-case Scenario for Flammable Chemicals:\n\n\n\nFor flammable substances subject to Program 3 requirements, the EPA requires that a worst-case scenario be evaluated and reported.  The worst-case scenario for substances that are normally liquid at ambient temperatures assumes that the single largest container fails catastrophically, the entire contents are released instantaneously and forms a pool.  It is assumed that the amount which vaporizes in the first ten minutes is involved in a vapor cloud explosion.  EPAA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis-2009 was used to perform the required offsite consequences analysis (OCA). \n\n\n\nThe worst-case flammable scenario is the complete loss of the 4,000,000 gallon denatured tank containing 97.5 vol% ethanol, 2.485 vol% gasoline (including HAPs) and the balance is a rust inhibitor. \n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario #1 for Flammable Chemicals:\n\n\n\nAccidental release of fuel (alternative denaturant containing HAPs) has an alternative scenario of the complete loss of the 4,000,000 gallon denatured tank.  EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis-2009 was use to perform the required OCA for this facility.\n\n\n\nTo determine the most extenuating impact from an alternative release a number of factors were evaluated.   These included looking at a release from either a tank or piping, vapor cloud fires, pool fires, BLEVE's and vapor cloud explosions.  \n\n\n\nD. Accidental Release Prevention:\n\n\n\nThe key co"

Five-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had any accidents involving denaturant that requires reporting under EPA's Risk Management Rules.\n\n\n\nF. Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThis facility has an Emergency Response Program and Emergency Response Plan for responding to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  As part of this program, ADM has personnel trained to the First Responder Awareness Level who can identify the released materials and activate the Plant Emergency Operations Plan, and First Responder Operations Level who can isolate the spill area, control access to the areas, and initiate containment activities under the direction of the Operations Officer.  Hazardous Waste clean-up activities are handled primarily by spill contractors.\n\n\n\nClinton County has a Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which has developed a county-wide emergency response plan that involves local industry, the fire departments, police departments, ambulance services, hospitals, the health department, the county highway department, local streets and sanitation department, and other local government agencies.  The plan organizes county-wide response to emergencies.\n\n\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs a result of a safety review of this facility's fuel alcohol system it has been determined that no changes are required to be made to the systems at this time.  ADM is continually evaluating options for improving processes and efficiencies in order to reduce the quantities of hazardous materials used and stored at its facilities.  In addition, ADM continually evaluates options at its facilities for replacing hazardous material with less hazardous m"
