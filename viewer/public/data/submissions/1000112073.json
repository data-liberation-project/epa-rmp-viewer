As a result of the PHA review, a number of improvements to the risk management program have either been completed or are planned.  The improvements are intended to improve the safety of the process and minimize the potential for a release.  Changes primarily include program changes (improved documentation), operating procedure or checklist updates, and employee training.\n\nRegistration:\n\nThis Risk Management Plan includes the required registration information referenced in 40 CFR \u00a768.160(b)(1) through (22) to be reported for a Program 3 process.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\nAs a Program 3 covered process with a regulated toxic substance, an offsite consequence analysis has been performed for one worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario.  The required data from the offsite consequence analyses is contained within this Risk Management Plan.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases meeting the definition contained in 40 CFR \u00a768.42(a) within the last five years of operation, or in the history of the plant.\n\nPrevention Program 3\n\nThis Risk Management Plan includes the required information referenced in 40 CFR \u00a768.170(b) through (p) to be reported for a Program 3 process.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis Risk Management Plan includes the required information referenced in 40 CFR \u00a768.180 to be reported for a Program 3 process.\n\nCertification\n\nThis submittal includes the required certification that, to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete."

The plan addresses fires, explosions, spills or releases of hazardous chemicals (including chlorine), severe weather, and other potential emergency conditions. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of local, state, and federal agencies.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes emergency response to chlorine releases. Should an emergency release of chlorine occur at the facility, the facility will be evacuated, the Holyoke Fire Department will be notified, and the Fire Department will assume Incident Command.\n\nNotification Exercises:  During 2023, the Holyoke Water Treatment Facility coordinated emergency response duties with the Fire Department (i.e. emergency evacuation drill), though this was not formally documented.

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the facility. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the Holyoke Fire Department, if necessary.\n\n(b) The Stationary Source and Substance Handled: The Holyoke Water Treatment Facility is a stationary source operating for the purpose of treating surface water for use in households, businesses, and industries within the Holyoke and surrounding communities.  Chlorine, which is a regulated, toxic substance, is used as part of the treatment process. \n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The City of Holyoke has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine at the Holyoke Water Treatment Facility located at 600 Westfield Road in Holyoke, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Holyoke Water Treatment Facility is a public utility, which is not subject to OSHA standards enforced through the federal Department of Labor.
