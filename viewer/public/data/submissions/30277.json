Wherever possible refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic). The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel.\n\n2.0 Morningstar Foods and Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nMorningstar Foods processes and cools milk, cream and soy products for national distribution. Approximately 14,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at Morningstar Foods. A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia from the system. \n\n3.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps.\n\nMorningstar Foods complies with all rules and regulations that pertain to the safe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia. Specific regulations include: OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule; OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER); OSHA Hazard Communication (HAZCOM); OSHA Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans; EPA Risk Management Plans (RMP). \n\nSpecific prevention steps that have been implemented to increase the safety of operation of the ammonia refrigeration system include: Two (2) emergency shut down push buttons are installed, enabling remote shutdown of the ammonia refrigeration system; the ammonia system is inspected daily; ammonia detectors are installed in the coolers and engine room; all refrigeration service valves have identification tags; security fencing has been installed around the facility; security personnel are on site"
