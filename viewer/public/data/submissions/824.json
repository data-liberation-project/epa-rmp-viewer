THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n   THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF SWIFT COOP OIL CO. ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n  THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZER FOR SALE TO FARMERS, AND PROPANE SALES AND DELIVERY.\n\n  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.  PROPANE GAS IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DELIVERY FOR HOME HEATING, FARM AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESS USE.\n\n  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 263,000 POUNDS IN OUR 2-30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF PROPANE GAS STORED WOULD BE 217,000 POUNDS IN OUR TWO 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\na. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS  WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF A STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.12 MILES.\n\n  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85% CAPACITY (108,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN A VAPO"

THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n  THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85% (108,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN TWO-THIRDS OF A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION.   ACCORDING TO EPA LOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS (FACTOR OF.67 X.43 MILES = .29 MILES) .29 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n  THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\". IN ADDITION, MN DEPT. OF AG RULES.  FOR PROPANE, NFPA-58 RULES.\n\n5. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\na. THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA OR PROPANE IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT:\n   HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT HE FACILITY; NOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n  THE FACILITY HAS:\n\na.  A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1919.38;\n\nb.  PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n\nc.  COORDINATED WITH LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.\n\n7.
