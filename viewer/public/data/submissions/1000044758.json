              "Description": "The Sulfur Trioxide/Sulfur Dioxide Sulfonation process consists of two production units interconnected to a common Sulfur Trioxide day tank and a Sulfur Trioxide storage tank.  The Sulfur Trioxide day tank is located inside of a heated and enclosed dike that can contain the entire contents of the tank.  This dike as well as all of the Sulfur Trioxide processing equipment is located inside of a concrete wall and roof process building.  The Sulfur Trioxide storage tank is located inside of a heated building that can contain the entire contents of the tank.  Sulfur Trioxide is received in 2,600 gallon tank trucks which are unloaded in a concrete dike that can contain the entire contents of the tank truck.  The Sulfur Trioxide unloaders undergo an extensive training program and yearly certification is required.\n\n\n\nThe Sulfur Dioxide storage tanks are located in a covered, outside, concrete dike that can contain the entire contents of one tank.  Sulfur dioxide is received in 3,500 gallon tank trucks which are then unloaded in a concrete dike that can contain the entire contents of the tank truck.  Sulfur Dioxide is unloaded approximately 12 times a year.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide detectors are placed in 9 strategic locations throughout the process building and storage areas.  The detectors activate both visual and audible alarms inside of the control room and a visual alarm inside of the process area.\n\n\n\nAll processing vessels are designed and tested to ASME codes and fitted with relief systems.  Each relief valve is installed downstream of a rupture disk to effect isolation from the process chemicals.  All positive displacement type pumping systems are fitted with internal or bypass type relief valves.\n\n\n\nBoth production units are computer controlled utilizing a DCS system with equipment interlocks.  These interlocks prevent inadvertent startups and allow for orderly shutdown in the event of loss of power, instrument air or steam or other process upsets.  All process equipment and valves are designed to shut down to a safe condition.  All critical process parameters utilize alarming routines through the control system that activate both visual and audible alarms in the control room.\n\n\n\nAn emergency shutdown system stops all transfer pumps, closes all isolation and control valves and sounds an audible alarm thus limiting the amount of a toxic release and alerting personnel of an emergency situation.  The emergency shutdown system can be activated by pressing a conspicuously marked red palm button in any one of three locations in the process building.  Training on the use of the emergency systems occurs at least once a year.\n\n\n\nBoth production units are registered under International Standard Organization ISO 9001:2008 and are in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  Process and operating procedure changes are processed under a sophisticated Management of Change and Document Control system that assesses the safety, environmental and technical impacts of a process change.\n\n\n\nAn operator training program is in place that utilizes a combination of classroom training and demonstration of competency with evaluation by written test and observation.  Operators receive training on new and revised operating procedures as well as personal safety and process safety topics.\n\n\n\nThe mechanical integrity of the process and control equipment, relief systems and instrumentation is maintained by preventive maintenance and equipment calibration programs.\n\n",

              "Description": "The Sulfur Trioxide vaporizer and Air/Sulfur Trioxide Sulfation equipment is interconnected to the Sulfur Trioxide storage tank.  The Sulfur Trioxide vaporizer and Air/Sulfur Trioxide Sulfation equipment is located inside of a concrete wall and roof process building.  The vaporizer, reactor and Sulfur Trioxide absorber are each situated above concrete pits large enough to contain the entire contents of the largest vessel.\n\n\n\nAll processing vessels are designed and tested to ASME codes and fitted with relief systems.  Each relief valve is installed downstream of a rupture disk to effect isolation from the process chemicals.  All positive displacement type pumping systems are fitted with internal or bypass type relief valves.\n\n\n\nThe process is computer controlled utilizing a PLC system with equipment interlocks.  These interlocks prevent inadvertent startups and allow for orderly shutdown in the event of loss of power, instrument air or steam or other process upsets.  All process equipment and valves are designed to shut down to a safe condition.  All critical process parameters utilize alarming routines through the control system that activates both visual and audible alarms in the control room.\n\n\n\nAn emergency shutdown system stops all transfer pumps, closes all isolation and control valves and sounds an audible alarm thus limiting the amount of a toxic release and alerting personnel of an emergency situation.  The emergency shutdown system can be activated by pressing a conspicuously marked red palm button in the control room.  Training on the use of the emergency systems occurs at least once a year.\n\n\n\nThe Air/Sulfur Trioxide Sulfation process is registered under International Standard Organization ISO 9001:2008 and is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  Process and operating procedure changes are processed under a sophisticated Management of Change and Document Control system that assesses the safety, environmental and technical impacts of a process change.\n\n\n\nAn operator training program is in place that utilizes a combination of classroom training and demonstration of competency with evaluation by written test and observation.  Operators receive training on new and revised operating procedures as well as personal safety and process safety topics.\n\n\n\nThe mechanical integrity of the process and control equipment, relief systems and instrumentation is maintained by preventive maintenance and equipment calibration programs.\n\n",

Pilot Chemical is also committed to the maintenance of a quality management system which meets the requirements of the International Standards Organization ISO 9001:2008.  This commitment requires the work force to focus on the production of a quality product through continuous improvement in all phases of its operations.\n\n\n\nThe Pilot Chemical Company of Ohio, Middletown Plant occupies 27 acres in an open, relatively flat, combination rural and industrial area, southwest of Middletown, Ohio.  The original facility was constructed in 1984 with building additions in 1995 and 2012 and process additions in 1995 and 1998. The facility produces detergent grade sulfonic acid, synthetic detergents, surfactants and emulsifiers through continuous sulf(on)ation and neutralizer systems for use in the industrial, agricultural and personal care markets.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substances on site exceeding threshold quantities are Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide, both of which are toxics, and Isopropylamine and Ethanol, both of which are flammable liquids.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide is a clear, water-white liquid at temperatures below its atmospheric-pressure boiling point of\n\n14 deg. F.  Sulfur Dioxide is stored on site as a liquefied, compressed gas at a pressure near 100 psi.  Sulfur\n\nDioxide vapors are colorless and heavier than air, but are extremely irritating and suffocating at concentrations above 30 ppm. With a distinctive rotten egg smell, Sulfur Dioxide has good warning properties with an odor threshold of 0.5 ppm.

Sulfur Trioxide fumes react with the moisture in the air to form a dense, white cloud of Sulfuric Acid mist.  This mist is extremely irritating to the eyes, skin and respiratory system.\n\n\n\nIsopropylamine is a colorless, water-white, highly flammable liquid with a strong ammonia-like odor.  Isopropylamine evaporates readily evolving vapor that is heavier than air and easily ignited.

Ethanol is completely miscible in water.  Ethanol has a flash point of 54?F and is considered a Class IB flammable liquid by OSHA and NFPA.  With a lower flammability limit of 3.3%, releases of Ethanol are potential fire hazards.  Ethanol is normally stable, but reacts violently with strong oxidizing agents.\n\n\n\nIndustries and residences are at least 600 feet from the main building containing the sulfonation processes and from the Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide storage tanks.
