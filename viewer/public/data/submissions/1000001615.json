      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 1963, the City of Oregon Water Treatment Plant has used chlorine as part of its treatment process in providing safe drinking water to its consumers.  During those 36 years, we have never had an off site release.  We recognize that chlorine can be a hazardous chemical if safety precautions are not followed and we work very hard to protect our employees and our neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe Water Plant is designed to treat 16 million gallons per day of water drawn in from Lake Erie. The treatment plant is a lime-caustic soda softening plant with rapid sand filters.  The chlorine is fed for disinfection  purposes from one ton containers.  The chlorine in the containers is in the liquid form under pressure and it is drawn off by vacuum as a gas.\r\n\r\nChlorine ton containers are transported to the plant by flat bed truck.  An overhead monorail lifts the containers off the truck and moves them to the storage building.  We receive four containers per shipment approximately once per month.\r\n\r\n\r\nRMP - RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\n\r\nManagement System - Overall responsibility of the system for the Water Plant rests with the Superintendent and Chief Operator\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation Plan - An Employee Participation Committee has been formed consisting of  Superintendent, Chief Operator, Water Operator, Instrumentation Technician/Operator II, and  Water Treatment Maintenance/Operator II.   It is the committee's responsibility to conduct the Process Hazard Analysis and implement, and review Operating Procedures and recommend modifications.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information - Diagrams and schematics are available and  employees have been trained and are familiar with the chlorination process.  Any new employee will be fully trained before they are expected to work with the process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The  Process Hazard Analysis is carried out by the Employee Participation Committee.  The overall process is evaluated,  and possible rec"

Follow-up meetings are conducted to check on the progress of the items  to be implemented.  The checklist method was utilized.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures - Operating procedures are documented using a standardized format.  Copies of procedures are given to all employees during classroom training and hands-on training.  Annually these procedures are reviewed by the either the Chief Operator or the Supintendent.  Any changes in procedures must follow the Management of Change requirements and  documentation  of the changes made on the Controlled  Documents.\r\n\r\nTraining - All new employees are given initial training  prior to working independently with the chlorine process.  Refresher training will be given at a minimum of every 3 years.  Maintenance/Operators will receive additional hands-on training relating to equipment repair and maintenance.  Records are kept of all training including the means to evaluate that the training was understood.\r\n\r\nContractor Safety - Policies are in place to evaluate contractor's qualifications before a selection is made.  Contractors will be given orientation and training on the chlorine process their first day of work.  Records are kept of contractor injuries and illness.  This information is periodically reviewed and evaluated during the construction phase.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review - A pre-startup safety review will be performed for any  new process regulated under the RMP and any existing process with modifications significant enough to change the safety information.  Any deficiencies will have a corrective action taken before start up is attempted.\r\n\r\nMechanical  Integrity - An effective mechanical integrity program is integral to preventing accidental chemical releases that may result from mechanical failure.  Maintenance personnel are trained with proper maintenance techniques.  Personnel will only use factory specified parts when working on"

A review must be completed for any temporary or permanent change in the chlorine process which includes replacement other than replacement in kind.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - If any leak would occur, procedures are set to form a team and compile information about the incident no later than 48 hours after the report.  The results and any new recommendations must be communicated to employees and documented on operating procedures.\r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response - A written emergency action plan is maintained.  Employees are given the plan and trained in the appropriate response.  There is also coordination with the Oregon and Jerusalem Fire Departments.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits - Compliance audits are carried out by a team comprising an outside individual knowledgeable in PSM an RMP auditing, plant superintendent and senior operator.  After the completion of the audit, employees will be notified of any recommendations and changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no off site consequences from the Oregon Water Treatment Plant in the last five years.  In fact, there have been no off site consequences from the Oregon Water Treatment Plant since the plant started operating in 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWater Treatment Plant personnel are trained in the use of  a Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).  However, our Emergency Action Plan calls for notifying  the Oregon Fire Department if the leak is anything put minor.  Both Oregon Fire Station #1 and Jerusalem Fire Department have toured the plant and are familiar with the chlorine location and process.  The Oregon Fire Depa"
