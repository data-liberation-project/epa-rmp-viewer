SAA trains and qualifies its personnel to properly engage in activities related to the usage and storage of chlorine; this includes its distribution system which is used in the manufacturing of aluminum products. SAA employees attend Chlorine Safety Training during pre-employment orientation. This pre-employment orientation training includes instruction on chlorine properties, hazards, and the use of chlorine in SAA's manufacturing processes. In addition, numerous employees are selected to participate in 24-hour HAZWOPER training on an annual basis. We believe that HAZWOPER training provides employees with advanced understanding for responding and coordinating emergencies involving hazardous chemicals such as chlorine. Each operating shift is staffed with personnel trained in HAZWOPER to ensure adequate coverage during operational hours. HAZWOPER training records are kept up-to-date and on-file with the on-site Safety Office. \n\n\n\nFacility description and the regulated substances handled: Superior Aluminum Alloys, LLC is a Secondary Aluminum processing facility that manufactures several aluminum products. Chlorine gas is used in SAA's manufacturing processes as a fluxing agent to reduce magnesium levels. Chlorine is injected and distributed throughout a molten bath via a pump. Chlorine is distributed through a piping distribution system equipped with vaporizers. Under normal conditions, eight (8) one-ton cylinders of chlorine are attached to the distribution system. The system is designed such that chlorine is released from four (4) cylinders at a time. The chlorine is released from the cylinders by opening a needle valve, as each cylinder is pressurized. The chlorine is then pi"

SAA maintains an inventory of no more than twenty-four (24) one-ton cylinders, eight (8) of which are connected to the distribution system, while the remaining cylinders (not to exceed sixteen (16)) are stored on a fenced-in rack system outside of the distribution room. Chlorine is the only substance handled at the facility that is currently regulated under the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), Section 112(r) Risk Management Planning Requirements. Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is designated as a regulated toxic substance under the U.S. EPA provisions for chemical accident prevention (40 CFR Part 68) with a threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds. Since the facility stores chlorine in excess of the applicable threshold, SAA is required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan and comply with the requirements 40 CFR Part 68 as authorized by the CAAA, Section 112(r). SAA's chlorine-based programs and processes are required to meet 40 CFR Part 68 Program 3 requirements because worst case off-site consequence analysis shows a potential impact to offsite populations and receptors.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps: SAA is required to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency's accident prevention rule and all applicable codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Five-year Accident History: Superior Aluminum Alloys, LLC experienced one (1) incident within the previous five years, which necessitated reporting due to the incident's estimated quantity released. On Saturday, April 24, 2010 at approximately 1:45pm, Superior Aluminum Alloys, LLC (SAA) discovered that a chlorine release of a reportable quantity occurred at its facility in New Haven, Indiana.  It was determined that chlorine was released through a single liquid-line connection valve on a bank of four (4) manifolded 1-ton cylinders. The exact quantity released inside"

      "SummaryText": " the chlorine room is unknown. However, based on chlorine cylinder scale weights it is estimated that the quantity released inside the building was approximately 6,500 pounds.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine room was vented through a hood and into the facility's lime-coated baghouse, where some of the chlorine is believed to have been neutralized by lime. However, some remaining amount of chlorine likely exited the baghouse stack and/or the chlorine room directly.  The duration of the release was approximately 2.5 hours. All facility personnel were evacuated from the facility. Employees trained in 24-hour HAZWOPER responded to the release and were later assisted by emergency response authorities from New Haven, Indiana and Allen County. As a precautionary measure, approximately ten (10) residential properties north of the facility were evacuated. To SAA's knowledge, no employees or nearby residents were sent for medical treatment, as there were no acute or chronic health effects suffered by anyone.\n\n\n\nPhone calls were initiated at approximately 1:54pm to the following agencies: National Response Center, IDEM Spill Reporting Center / IERC, Allen County Emergency Management Agency, and New Haven Adams Township Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program: SAA complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations for chlorine storage. If an emergency occurs that results in the release of a reportable quantity, all necessary parties are notified, including the following: National Response Center, IDEM Spill Reporting Center / IERC, Allen County Emergency Management Agency, and New Haven Adams Township Fire Department. SAA maintains a staff of employees certified in 24-Hour HAZWOPER and On-Scene Incident Commander training. These individuals are trained and qualified to respond to chemical release emergencies.
