      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary for the Chipeta Gas Processing Facility\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\n\r\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  It is our policy to implement reasonable controls that provide for a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  In a situation that may require it, Anadarko employees and its wholly owned operating company, Chipeta Processing LLC will notify and cooperate will all emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant is located about 40 miles south of Vernal, UT, on Fiddlar Rd. The area surrounding the plant is a rocky desert with limited grazing.  The majority of this land is owned by the US Government and administrated by the BLM. The facility includes compression, dehydration, a natural gas liquid recovery system using propane refrigeration and cryogenic expander plants.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) consisting of a mixture of ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes, and a C6+ mixture referred to as stabilized gasoline.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  The principal purpose of the plant is to remove water and heavier hydrocarbons from the produced natural gas, thus lowering the hydrocarbon dew point and BTU value of the sales gas to meet pipeline specifications.  The LPG liquids are either trucked out or shipped out via pipeline as market conditions and pipeline capacity allows.  The stabilized gasoline is trucke"

      "SummaryText": "d out.  Storage of the LPG liquids consists of three 60,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks. The total storage capacity of the pressurized storage tanks exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold, for flammable substances.  Therefore, the facility is subject to the regulations found in the Risk Management Program.  Because the plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic, there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.  There are no public receptors within the calculated worst-case vapor cloud 1 psi over-pressure distance, which has been calculated by RMP Comp. as being 0.5 miles.  This is based on the complete release of one of the 60,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks, which would release 300,000 lbs of flammable materials.  A 3rd party has constructed a field compressor station and field office just SW of the plant.  This office is within the 0.5 mile 1 psi over-pressure radius for a complete failure of an NGL tank and subsequent Vapor Cloud Explosion.For this reason, the RMP is being resubmitted as a program level 3 facility.  The alternative case involving a pump seal failure estimates a 2000 gallon release (6000 lbs).  The calculated ROE for this release scenario is 0.1 miles.  The 3rd party field office is located outside that predicted ROE.    \r\n\r\nAccidental Release History\r\n \r\nThere have been no Accidental Releases at this facility since it became operational in 2008.  APC has a comprehensive program that requires investigation into all significant incidents that did or could have resulted in a catastrophic release.  There have been no such releases at this facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.   The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. \r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.   For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument sys"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n \r\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant uses the process hazards analysis (PHA) technique to perform these evaluations.  These reviews are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are reviewed at least annually to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Chipeta Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, 5) safe and hot work permits as required.  In addition the Chipeta Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance mechanism by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, heat exchangers, compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: 1) conducting training, 2) developing written procedures, 3) performing inspections and tests, 4) correcting identified deficiencies, and 5) applying quality"

All of these activities will be tracked and documented using an asset management database.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on 1) an overview of the process, 2) safety and health hazards, 3) applicable maintenance procedures, 4) emergency response plans, and 5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to verify that equipment parameters are within acceptable limits.  For a vessel, the parameter being monitored would typically be wall thickness. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n \r\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant has established and will follow the safe work practices developed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; 2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; 3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened; 4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e. hot work); 5) proper selection and use of PPE; and 6) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures along with training of affected personnel form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to 1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, 2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change, and 3) ensure that changes do not introduce an unknown hazard to the process.  Affected chemical hazard information, process-operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Chipeta Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents it findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits \r\n\r\nTo guarantee that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Chipeta Gas Plant audits to determine that the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
