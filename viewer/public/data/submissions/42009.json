We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Galveston believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City of Galveston Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine, where the substances can be \u00bfadsorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel\u00bf.\n\nThe City of Galveston has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.  The training includes class"

Above all, all employees know where the phone numbers of the first responders are located should a release occur.\n\n\n \nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Airport Water Pump Station utilizes chlorine for disinfection.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantity for Chlorine is shown below.  Ammonia inventory is always below the RMP threshold of 20,000 pounds.  Process Safety Information is presented for ammonia for employee awareness.  The same emergency plan is used in the case of an ammonia leak.\n\nChemical\tMaximum Inventory (lb.)\tThreshold Quantity (lb.)\n\t\t\nChlorine\t6,000\t2,500\n\t\t\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario as defined in 40 C.F.R. 68.  A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since chlorine is heavier than air.  The model\u00bfs input parameters are summarized in the table below.\n\nSLAB Input Parameters\n\tWorst-Case Scenario\tAlternative Scenario\nWindspeed (m/s)\t1.5\t3\nAtmospheric Stability Class\tF\tD\nTemperature (?

The population data was estimated using the Block Uniform Density Group Method in Landview III, which uses the 1990 U.S. Census to estimate population.  The public and environmental receptors are listed in Section 8 of this plan.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSLAB Output Parameters\n\tWorst-Case Scenario\tAlternative Scenario\nImpact Radius\t3\t0.4\nEstimated Population with Impact Area\t73,000\t1000\n\n \nThe City of Galveston has implemented a General Accidental Release Prevention Program to minimize re"
