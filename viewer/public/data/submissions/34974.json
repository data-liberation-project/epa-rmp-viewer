The facity is located in Hillsdale, Michigan.\n\nThe RMP covered process is an ammonia based industrial refrigeration system operating in a basic Carnot cycle.\n\nSafety programs at the facility are extensive, incorporating process (ammonia refrigeration) related programs as well as general industry (29 CFR 1910) based programs. These programs include support from our corporate safety departement.\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were discussed and calculated for the facility. The chosen scenariios were calculated and the information specific to those scenarios are outlined in other areas of this RMP submittal.\n\nIn addition, an Emergency Response team, has been developed at the facility to respond to accidental releases, none of which have occurred over the last five years."
