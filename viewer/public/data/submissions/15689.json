Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is a facility policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State and Local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia with it's Emergency Response Plan and is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nThe primary activity at this facility ( the stationary source ) is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for direct sale to farmers.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia for direct sale to farmers.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia is approximately 149,280 pounds stored in 1/30,000gal storage tanks.  The maximum fill level of the tank(s) is 85% of the total tank(s) capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 149,280, which represents the volume of storage at 85% of capacity as limited by design standards.  \nThe distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\nThe alternate release scenario involves the release of anhydrous ammonia from a 95 pounds.\n\nThe facility complies with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and Local codes and regulations.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that: Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.  Nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, and evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or envir"
