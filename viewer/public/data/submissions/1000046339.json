Should an accidental release occur the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact to people and the environment.\r\n     Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 497,394. The capacity of the tank is 30,000 gallons, and 50 - 1,OOO, 10 - 1,465, AND 6 - 2,000 gallon nurse tanks are included in this maximum capacity.\r\n     The Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n     The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know infromation as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reveiwed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\r\n     Planned changes to improve safety: Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional"
