Tracy, California, Bleach facility is committed to the safety and well being of its employees, neighboring community, and the environment.  Pioneer is an active member of the Chlorine Institute, an industry group that develops technology for the safe handling and management of chlorine.  Pioneer also participates in the Canadian Chemical Producers? Association Responsible Care? initiative.  Responsible Care? is the industry?s effort to reach out and dialogue with the public regarding our environmental, health and safety programs and to receive input from the community on issues of concern.\n\nStationary Source\n\nThe site produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic) and repackages chlorine into 1-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders.  The site also distributes sulfur dioxide in 1-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders.    These chemicals provide important benefits in critical applications such as water purification and household disinfectants.  Pioneer?s policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of a hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThis Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Pioneer Tracy Bleach facility.\n\nLiquefied chlorine is received in 90-ton rail cars and repackaged into one-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders.  It is also used in the manufacture of bleach.  Customers use both chlorine and bleach to treat drinking water, wastewater, swimming pool water and industrial water to eliminate and/or prevent the growth of harmful organisms.\n\nSulfur dioxide is received in ton containers and 150-pound cylinders and is stored on-site for distributio"

Sulfur dioxide is also used in water treatment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPioneer has a comprehensive release prevention program, meeting the Federal RMP Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management (?PSM?) requirements.  We have physical safeguards in place to prevent a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  We also follow best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation.  Our process design includes expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAn incident involving a 23-pound release of chlorine occurred on October 16, 2000, in a cylinder that had passed an outside vendor hydrotest on September 18, 2000.  Pioneer employees noticed a chlorine odor.  Upon investigating, they noticed a small cloud of chlorine.  The employees immediately evacuated the area.  The office personnel were also evacuated, as the location of the cylinder was nearby.  A neighbor across the street from the facility was asked to stay indoors.  The Tracy Fire Department was called and responded to the site.  Plant response employees donned appropriate personal protective equipment, then put the cylinder in a containment vessel.  There were no injuries, either on site or off site.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPioneer has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes detection, alarm, shutdown, containment and scrubbing systems to halt and/or mitigate a release.  In the unlikely event that a release cannot be controlled completely with these systems, Pioneer has an Emergency Response Team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a written Emergency Response Plan.  Pioneer has worked closely with the Tracy Fire Department, San Joaquin County Sheriffs Department, San Joaquin Office of Emergency Services and Local Emergency Planni"

Future plans for improved safety include the installation of a tank level control system and expansion of the video surveillance system."
