In September of\r\n2008 Bozzuto's moved into an existing refrigerated warehouse distribution center. Among its advantages, this\r\ndistribution center utilizes the benefits of ammonia as a refrigerant. Bozzuto's does recognize ammonia as a\r\npotentially hazardous chemical, and this was a consideration when selecting the facility. In consideration of the\r\nrisks associated with the use of ammonia, Bozzuto's commits its efforts to ensuring the employees and\r\nsurrounding community continue to enjoy a healthy and safe environment.\r\nPart of this commitment includes:\r\n- Employing only skilled refrigeration technicians;\r\n- Contracting with only experienced ammonia refrigeration contractors;\r\n- Organizing an in-house Emergency Response Team;\r\n- Coordination with the North Haven Fire Department;\r\n- Partnering with a hazardous materials release contractor; and\r\n- Maintaining communication with the designated North Haven Local Emergency Planning Commission.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\nAccidental release prevention is the approach Bozzuto's has taken to minimize and possibly eliminate the\r\npotential for an accidental release. Bozzuto's exercises ongoing preventive maintenance and equipment\r\nintegrity procedures.\r\nSome of these programs include:\r\n- Process Safety Management / Risk Management\r\n- Hazard Communication, and\r\n- Lockout / Tagout\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nBozzuto's maintains a twenty-four hour a day, seven day a week coverage of trained Security Officers. If an\r\nemergency were to arise, the notifier will dial an emergency extension and be connected to a Security Officer.\r\nThe Security Officer will gather the information and initiate the Emergency Response Plan.\r\nHaving this continuous coverage reduces the response time in"

Accidental release prevention programs include:\r\n- Process Safety Management / Risk Management,\r\n- Hazard Communication,\r\n- Lockout / Tagout, and\r\n- Risk Management.\r\nThrough a Process Hazard Analysis Study, Bozzuto's uses a hazard and operability study to identify potential\r\naccidental release conditions. Solutions are then developed to prevent or limit these conditions from\r\nhappening.\r\nIf an incident were to happen, an investigation would take place, and new procedures would be implemented so\r\na similar occurrence could be prevented.\r\nAll Bozzuto's prevention programs are audited at regular intervals to validate their effectiveness; the objective is\r\nto be proactive in preventing accidental releases, not reactive.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR HISTORY\r\nEPA's RMP Regulation defines Accident as the following:\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold\r\nquantity in the process.\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\nOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\r\nKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place\r\n(\u00a768.42(a)).\r\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis study on March 27, 2018, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet this\r\ncriteria in the past five years (March 2013 - March 2018). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from\r\nan ammonia release, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nBozzuto's Emergency Response Plan is organized in multiple levels of response, many of which are by trained\r\nBozzuto's employees.
