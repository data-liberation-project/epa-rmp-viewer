      "SummaryText": "1.0    SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n1.1    Source\nThe Elm Grove Dairy facility in Richland Center, Wisconsin (the Richland Center facility) is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The facility actually has two separate systems.  The old system contains approximately 5,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, while the new system contains 15,000 pounds.  Therefore, the entire facility contains approximately 20,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver on the new system that operates between 110 and 160 psig and can contain as much as 13,800 pounds of liquid ammonia, assuming a 90 percent fill volume.  However, during typical operation, the vessel holds only 4,600 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, small vessels called surge drums, refrigerated silos, and much of the system piping are located on or near the roof. \n\n1.2    Process Description\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Richland Center facility is a single-stage system that controls the temperature for milk, yogurt, and sour cream processing and packaging.  Equipment and piping carry the necessary gas, liquid, and saturated vapor throughout the system.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves (SRVs), engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  SRVs protect the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, accumulators, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with over-pressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for the vessels.\n2.0    POTENTIAL RELEASE "

      "SummaryText": "SCENARIOS\nAs required by the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative-case release) were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the ammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  The release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (the \"Model Plan\"), dated May 1996.\n\n2.1    Worst-case release\nThe worst-case release is defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the contents of the largest vessel and associated piping (approximately 13,800 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the \"Model Plan\" and assuming the facility is located in a rural area, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release extends beyond the facility's property boundary.  \n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the high pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs every year by a State of Wisconsin inspector.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with dual safety relief valves (SRVs) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as lo"

Because the building can serve as a passive mitigator to this release, passive mitigation  was used to reduce the release rate and the distance to the endpoint.  Using the specified meteorology contained in the \"Model Plan\", the distance to the endpoint for the \"more likely\" release scenario extends beyond the facility's property boundary.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n7 Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n7 The facility has a sprinkler system throughout the plant;\n7 Ammonia detectors exist in the engine room, which would detect a leak quickly; \n7 The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system; and\n7 The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel.\n3.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the o"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n7 The development of an employee participation program, which includes Richland Center facility employees from all areas within the plant.\n7 The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n7 The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using a \"What-If\" Protection Analysis.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system. The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\n7 Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n7 Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.
