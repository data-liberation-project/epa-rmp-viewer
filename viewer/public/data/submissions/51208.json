A member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and an ISO 9001:2000 registered company that has been in business since 1916.\n\nBulk commodity chemicals are repackaged into smaller containers such as drums and totes. Blending and packaging products per customers? requests, Acid Products serves numerous industries including; automotive, electronic, aerospace, food and drug, cosmetics, cleaning, and those involved with water treatment.\n\nRaw materials that are used in everyday household items such as; nail polish remover, bleach, vinegar, soft drink formulations, and even some that are used in treating swimming pools.\n\nSome chemicals arrive in concentrated form before being diluted (i.e., adding water). In this concentrated form, such products present increased hazards and regulatory scrutiny. Notably our formaldehyde 37% and hydrofluoric acid 70%; held in aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) at our facility. The exact locations and quantities of these stored products are on file with several agencies including the State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee and Fire Department. \n\nAcid Products ?Qualifies? as a EPA RMP Program 3 facility, per 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1), and is also subject to OSHA's PSM standard for the same two products(i.e, formaldehyde 37% and hydrofluoric acid 70%). Since the worst-case accidental release endpoints extend slightly beyond the property, and could affect surrounding public receptors should an incident occur. \n\nAcid Products employs numerous safety precautions, and maintains various written operating procedures that provide clear instructions and steps for safely conducting activities associated with each covered process consistent with the best industry practices. Should an incident occur, Acid Products shall initiate our Emergency Action Plan that is designed to protect loss of life and/or injury"

Fire\n?    Tornado \n?    Earthquake \n?    Bomb threat\n?    Hazardous chemical spill\n\nAcid Products is capable of responding to minor incidents, however, should a major incident occur, outside help is readily available. Professional response companies and public support services; (Dial 911) Cook Count Sheriffs Department and local Fire Department. In such an event, an incident command system will ensure proper management of the situation. \n\nAs accident prevention is our primary goal, Acid Products routinely performs and documents compliance audits. Evaluating that procedures and practices are adequate; and are being followed. Any findings/problems that the audit may reveal are document; including what actions Acid Products will take to address concerns. All written records of findings and actions resulting from the two (2) most recent compliance audits are kept on file; typically retained for five (5) years or more. \n\nIt should be noted that no accidental releases from our RMP products referenced above have occurred at our facility; investigation going back for over a decade.\n\nAcid Products has a comprehensive training program that ensures each employee presently operating an affected process, and each employee newly assigned to a covered process, has been tested and determined to be competent in the Operating Procedures that pertains to their duties. Acid Products certifies this in writing; that the employee has the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities as provided in the operating procedures."
