The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Advance are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Stoddard County LEPC, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. The facility is also a full-service agricultural supply cooperative.\n\n\n\nThe largest quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3.

The facility will continue to move towards the requirements of the newest codes as time and budgets will allow.\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. Currently the facility is evaluating the requirements of CGA 2.1, 2014 and Process Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and will make the required upgrades needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    4/25/16\n\n\n\n"
