The facility produces and stores bakery products.  The ammonia refrigeration system is defined as a closed loop \u00c2\u00bfdirect\u00c2\u00bf type system. \n\nThis Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n \nThe five-year accident history.\n \nThe emergency response program.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCottage Bakery facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, 3rd party consulting and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the facility refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nA Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis and an Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis were performed identifying the public"

Per the RMP regulations one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the largest equipment item (given that the Ammonia Refrigeration System is comprised of interconnected equipment) we used the Intercooler releasing 18,688 pounds in 10.0 minutes. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences, however no credit was taken for passive mitigation except for the administrative constraints that all qualified ammonia refrigeration personnel know not to fill a receiver more than 80%.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used. The results show that off-site areas will be affected. This WCS is highly unlikely to occur because of system safety systems; 24/7 system operator and normal operation of the system. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nA more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled as a release of anhydrous ammonia vapor as a result of an ammonia relief valve relieving for 10 minutes at 57.7 lbs/min.  For this alternative release scenario, the total quantity of ammonia calculated to be released is 577 pounds.\n\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used. ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 200 ppm.   The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTATIVE STEPS\n\nThe basic elements have been developed and are now in place. These include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nStanda"

The leak occurred on or about April 5, 2005 as a result of a Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) unseating during a startup procedure and failing to immediately reseat, thus releasing approximately 125 pounds of ammonia during a twenty minute period.  Personnel in the area were moved to a different on-site location and the valve was isolated.  The OES was contacted. There were no injuries and no off site consequences due to the release.  The release was contained on site. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEmergency response is discussed in the RMP and Cottage Bakery has filed a Chemical Inventory Business Emergency Plan with San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services. The plan includes:\n-Emergency alarm procedures\n-Evacuation procedures\n-Safety and health considerations\n-Notification procedures\n The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release including notification protocol. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCottage Bakery is incorpora"
