Plant 751112 (Charlotte South) facility abides by the emergency response procedures and policies detailed in the Emergency Response Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)\tTo save lives.\n2.)\tTo minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)\tTo protect the environment.\n4.)\tTo minimize property damage.\n\nAmeriCold Logistics maintains an emergency response (safety) committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold Logistics plant 751126 (Charlotte South) chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it i"

Plant 75112 (Charlotte south) facility located at 12520 General Drive, Charlotte, NC 28273.  These action items were entered into a management plan and were addressed.\n\nIn addition to the equipment related mitigation measures recommended to improve safety at this facility, the RMP Development Team made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety.  These recommendations are a result of the review of the PSM prevention programs and the Emergency Response Program for preparation of the Risk Management Program and Plan. These recommendations were also entered into a management plan and were addressed."
