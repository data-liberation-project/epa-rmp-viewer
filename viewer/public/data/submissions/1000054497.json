Williams Ohio Valley Midstream LLC is committed to\r\nthe safety and health of its employees, contractors and visitors. This commitment is demonstrated in the\r\ndesign, installation, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this\r\nfacility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response\r\nprocedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal\r\nand as such a site specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Fort Beeler Gas Plant is located approximately 4 miles Northwest of Cameron, West Virginia; Marshall\r\nCounty. It is a cryogenic expander plant that is designed to extract liquid petroleum products (ethane,\r\npropane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce\r\npipeline quality (primarily methane) gas. The plant contains an above threshold quantity of regulated\r\nflammable substances, including methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane (liquid petroleum\r\nproducts). There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances present at the Fort Beeler Gas Plant.\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Fort Beeler Gas Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific accidental release prevention\r\nprogram that consists of a detailed facility mechanical integrity program and employee training program. The\r\nmechanical integrity program was developed under the guidelines of manufacturer written\r\nrecommendations, recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards\r\nand past operation history. Employee training was designed to ensure/document employee understandin"

The ERP includes\r\nthe names and phone numbers not only of company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of\r\nsupport services (contractor, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory\r\nagencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance. Liaison with these agencies is maintained to\r\nensure timely and proper responses. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency\r\nsituation is high priority.\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nWilliams Ohio Valley Midstream LLC believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Williams\r\ncontinues to look for, develop, and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify\r\nand correct potential workplace hazards. Williams also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and\r\nprocedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employee\r\nunderstanding of these policies, programs and procedures is high priority."
