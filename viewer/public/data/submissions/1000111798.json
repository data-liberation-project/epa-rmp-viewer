This process has proven to reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\n\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. In 2016, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. We participate in the County LEPC meetings and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. The services of a professional organization to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to notify businesses or residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are routinely conducted.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Reidsville has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nAt the Water Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- GHS Hazard Communications\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n- Lockout/Tagged\n- Confined Space\n- Emergency Action Plan\n- Emergency Spill Response\n\n\n \nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an excellent safety record with no recordable injuries and no reportable chlorine releases since the City of Reidsville resumed management. \n\nThe Plant has worked extensively to upgrade its safety program and has retained Envirosafe Consulting to assist with chemical safety, EHS, PSM/RMP and training."
