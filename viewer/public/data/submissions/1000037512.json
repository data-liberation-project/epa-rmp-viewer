The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et.  Seq.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  Finally, both CalOSHA and OSHA regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\n\n\n\nFoster Farms prepared their initial RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve chlorine and anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility.

Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely event that a ammonia release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team to end the release.\n\n\n\nThe Livingston Complex is located at 843 Davis Street in Livingston, California.  The facility is approximately ? mile east of Highway 99 in the northeast portion of Livingston.  Restaurants, a hotel, a gasoline station, and other small retail facilities are located along Highway 99 in the vicinity of the complex.  Residential properties are also located near the site.  The Merced River is approximately ? mile north and northwest of the facility.  Retention basins and unimproved property lie to the north and northeast of the facility.  Railroad tracks border the facility on the west.  Agricultural lands generally surround the Livingston area.  The facility is surrounded by a security fence, prohibiting unauthorized access.  Additionally, the entrance is staffed by plant security personnel 24 hours-per-day, 365 days-per-year.\n\n\n\nThe Livingston Complex consists of four operating units, which are Plant 1, Plant 2, Deli, and Distribution.  Operations at Plants 1 and 2 include the slaughter, processing, storage, and packaging of poultry products.  Operations at the Deli include the production of deli products.  Corn dogs are produced and packaged at the Corn Dog Plant, which is part of the Deli.  Operations at the Northern California Di"

The Deli and NCDC 1 are immediately adjacent with a common wall separating the operations.  The Deli and NCDC 1 are located in the northwest corner of the site, approximately 200 feet north of Plant 2.  \n\n\n\nPlant 1 was originally constructed in 1965 and has undergone significant changes since that time.  Plant 2 was built in 1973 and has also been updated.  NCDC 1 was constructed in 1988/1989.  The Deli was constructed in 1971 and has also undergone significant changes.  A second refrigeration system was installed in 1998 as part of the Corn Dog Plant expansion.  \n\n\n\nThere are five independent ammonia refrigeration systems (processes) at the Livingston Complex.  Plant 1 has one ammonia refrigeration system.  Plant 2 has one ammonia refrigeration system.  The Deli has two ammonia refrigeration systems.  NCDC 1 has one ammonia refrigeration system.  All equipment is operated and maintained by a single team of trained refrigeration system technicians who are managed and dispatched by a single maintenance management team.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in closed-loop refrigeration systems at the facility.  The systems provide cooling for production areas, storage areas, freezers, product, water chilling, and ice making.  Central computer systems monitor and control the refrigeration systems.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.

      "SummaryText": "regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Livingston Complex due to the quantity of ammonia used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate one worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) for a facility and an alternative release scenario for each covered chemical.  The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.  For facilities with multiple processes, the regulations require that the worst case scenario with the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint must be modeled.  Additional worst case scenarios are not required if the affected populations from worst case release scenarios from other processes are within the populations affected by the selected scenario.  \n\n\n\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP.\n\n\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.\n\n\n\nThe predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.
