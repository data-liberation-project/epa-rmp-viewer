The WWT Division in conjunction with the Dothan Fire Department conducts annual chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak drill at one of the facilities.  This is a full scale drill simulation a cylinder rupture with injuries and simulation evacuation procedures.\n\nThe WWT Division has three wastewater treatment plants that store chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas in one ton containers used for disinfection on treated wastewater.  The quantities stored at each facility is as follows: Little Choctawhatchee-6,000 lbs. of chlorine gas and 6,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide;  Beaver Creek-6,000 lbs. of chlorine gas and 6,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide; Omussee Creek 10,000 lbs. of chlorine gas and 8,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide.  The total amount stored at all of the wastewater treatment plants is 22,000 lbs. of chlorine and 20,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe worst case scenerio for all three wastewater treatment plants would result in a maximum threat zone for sulfur dioxide of 3.2 miles.  Based on the 2,000 cencus, this release will affect residential population of 6,400 from Little Choctawhatchee, 21,000 from Beaver Creek, and 5,200 from Omussee.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for sulfur dioxide will affect a residential population of 4,300 from Little Choctawhatchee, 14,000 from Beaver Creek, and 2,700 from Omussee within a 2.6 miles.  The alternate release scenario for chlorine will affect a residential population of 3,500 from Little Choctawhatchee, 12,500 from Beaver Creek, and 2,300 from Omussee Creek within 2.4 miles.\n\nThe WWT Division has complied with the OSHA PSM rule , although Alabama is not an OSHA state.

The Dothan Fire Department's hazardous material team will take charge of stopping or mitigating the release of gas.  The annual full accidental release drill allows all agencies (Fire, Police,WWT) to critque their performance for improvement.  The WWT Division simulates leak drills quarterly at each facility to ensure operators are trained in SOP for emergency response.\n\nPerimeter motion sensors have been installed to detect unauthorized personnel entering the plant or the chemical storage area.\n\nThe WWT Division reveiws SOP, conduct hazard analysis, and performs an audit every three years in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule."
