This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Gulf Pine's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Magee Facility for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Magee Facility inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\n\n\n\nThe process of the compression and dehydration of natural gas and removal of condensate and natural gas liquids occurs in the following way.\n\n\n\nProduced natural gas is routed from the surrounding wells to the Magee Facility. Natural gas is routed to the compressor and then to the amine unit to remove CO2. The gas is then sent to the glycol dehydrator to remove entrained water. The gas is then sent to the JT unit prior to entering the sales pipeline. This unit is used for both dew point suppression and to recover NGL's without fractionation. Any liquids recovered by the JT unit are sent to the pressurized storage tank and then loaded onto pressurized tank trucks. Produced water is routed to the facility from the surrounding wells to one of the 500 barrel fixed roof atmospheric storage tanks. Any entrained oil is sent to the 210 barrel storag"

Any flash or working and breathing losses associated with the produced water storage tanks will be routed to the flare.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains two sources of regulated substances held over their respective threshold quantities; condensate (pentane) and natural gas liquids.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. \n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\n\n\nGulf Pine keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe Magee Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electric"

This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nHazard Review \n\n\n\nGulf Pine has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nGulf Pine used the Safety Analysis Checklist (SAC) technique to perform this evaluation. The analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe Hazard Review team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Magee Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nMagee Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new proce"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Magee Facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedence for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Magee Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nGulf Pine has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout training to ensure isolation of energy sources for equip"

Training of affected personnel helps ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nGulf Pine promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during hazard reviews and hazard review revalidations\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Gulf Pine periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Magee Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.    Tanks are gauged\n\n2.    Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n\n3.    High/Low alarms and shutdowns\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1.    Berms around tanks\n\n2.    Process relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere to prevent vessels from rupturing\n\n3.    Process relief valves that discharge to a vent header to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n4.    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n5.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\n\n6.    Redundant equipment and instrumentation \n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1.    Trained emergency response personnel\n\n2.    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n\n3.    SPCC Plan\n\n4.    Fire extinguishers\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Magee Facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the enviro"

      "SummaryText": "nment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Magee Facility is coordinated with the Simpson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Mr. Glen Jennings \n\nis the contact for the LEPC (601/847-3434).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Magee Facility has around-the-clock communications capability.  Gulf Pine operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.  The operator will then call the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Gulf Pine conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Magee Facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of reg"
