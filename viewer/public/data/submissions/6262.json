Purged Gas (PUR) is piped from the purge point at the piece of equipment to the Auto Purger.  This system has several purge point: the Condensers (CD101, CD102 and CD103) and the High Pressure Receiver (VS101). Each purge point consists of a solenoid valve with shutoff valves on either side for isolation.  Any non-condensables in the Vapor Stream are removed periodically by the Auto Purger.  The Auto Purger separates the Purged Gas (PUR).  It separates ammonia from the non-condensables by condensing the ammonia into a liquid.

Ammonia vapor, High Stage Suction (HSS), from the Suction Accumulator (VS102) is routed to the suction inlet of eight High Stage Compressors (CP101 through CP108).  \n\nAt the High Stage Compressors (CP101 through CP108), ammonia vapor (HSS) is compressed to a super heated vapor (HSD).  The super heated vapor (HSD) from the High Stage Compressors is routed from the engine room to the three Condensers (CD101, CD102 and CD103) at the condenser platform. At the Condensers the super heated vapor (HSD) rejects heat and converts to high pressure Condensed Liquid Drain (CLD).  The condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across ammonia coils.  The condensers are equipped with Safety Relief Valves which vent directly to a common relief header and then to atmosphere.  Airflow is supplied to the condensers via fans internal to the condenser and water is supplied via condenser water pumps.  \n\nWater from the condenser water sump is pumped via condenser water pumps to the Condensers (CD101, CD102 and CD103).  At the Condensers the water is sprayed via a spray header over the ammonia coils.  Water is collected at the bottom of the Condenser in a sump pan where it gravity drains back to the condenser water sump.  From here it is r"

In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nDean Foods in Rochester, Indiana manufactures some of the finest dairy products in the world.  The facility covers approximately 100,000 square feet and includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.  Also located at the facility are raw milk processing equipment and shipping and receiving docks.  The facility produces and ships approximately 280 million pounds of finished product each year.\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains in excess of 14,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nDean Foods has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.

      "SummaryText": "liquid/vapor mix from these evaporators is piped back to the Pumped Recirculator (VS104).  \n\nHigh Pressure Liquid from High Pressure Receiver (VS101) is also fed to several evaporators and storage silos throughout the facility.  The High Pressure Liquid (HPL) which is fed to the evaporators and silos typically passes through a solenoid valve and then an expansion valve at each unit.  As the High Pressure Liquid (HPL) passes through the expansion valve it undergoes a deliberate change in pressure which acts to expand part of the liquid to a vapor and sub-cools remainder of the liquid.  As the liquid passed through the evaporator or silo it absorbs heat, from the air or the material within the silo, changing from a liquid (HPL) to a vapor (HSS).  The vapor (HSS) from evaporators and silos passes through a suction regulator as it exits.  The vapor (HSS) from these evaporators is piped back into the High Stage Suction Header (HSS) and thus back to the Suction Accumulator (VS102).  \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nIn the worst case scenario the piping between the High Pressure Receiver (R-1) and the King Solenoid Valve is penetrated.  The E-Stop circuit is tripped.  This action shuts down the compressors and closes the King Solenoid Valve stopping the flow of ammonia through the refrigeration system.  The amount of ammonia that can continue to be expelled is the liquid that drains from the Condensers (CD101, CD102 and CD103) and Thermosyphon Vessel (VS109) to the High Pressure Receiver (VS101).  The calculated amount of this release is approximately 4,568 lbs.\n\nEPA's RMP*COMP \u0019 calculated a release rate of 457 lbs. per minute with release duration of ten minutes.  The Atmospheric Stability Class is F and the wind speed is 1.5 meters per second.  The topography around the facility is urban.

The Atmospheric Stability Class is D and the wind speed is 3.0 meters per second.  The topography around the facility is urban.\n\nSince the release occurred inside of Cooler #3, the cooler acted as a mitigating device with 8,540 ft2.  RMP*COMP \u0019 calculated a toxic radius of 0.10 miles with some public receptors.\n\nThe use of active mitigation devices include: Emergency shutdown systems.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDean Foods has had no reportable accidents in the past five years involving ammonia.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify the receptionist.  The receptionist makes an announcement over the public address system for the onsite Emergency Response Team to assemble in a designated location.  The Emergency Response Team then evaluates the situation and takes further actions.  Additionally piping has been removed from this location in the cooler.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n        Dean Foods is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Dean Foods to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system. \n\n        Among the improvements slated for completion in 1999 is an extensive operator training program, policy updates, additional emergency responder training, the addition of more safety equipment, cross training of maintenance and utility personnel and a complete Mechanical Integrity Inspection."
