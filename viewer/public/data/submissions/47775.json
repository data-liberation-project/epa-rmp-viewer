The Emergency Action Plan (RAP) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the Aspen Distribution's PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nAspen Distribution maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nAspen Distribution has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Victorville Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Aspen Distribution to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAspen Distribution began operation of the facility upon its completion in December 2001.  The ammonia system at Aspen Distribution consists primarily of vessels, compressors, condensers, evaporators and associated piping.  The majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nThe Aspen Distribution facility provides cold storage space and a docking area for candy items.  Ammonia sensors are located in the engine room, cold storage and dock areas that alert facility personn"

The ammonia detection system also has the capability to shut-off all electrical power to the engine room to eliminate the potential for an explosion.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 20,000 pounds.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Aspen Distribution ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. \n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine room and evaporator warehouses.  In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the off-site monitoring company.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.).  In the case of a power failure, a back-up generator with a minimum of two operating hours shall power the refrigeration control system, equipment room purge fan, evaporative condenser fan and water pump.\n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief line.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent through pressure relief valves to a common header which relieves to an outside water diffusion tank until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, si"

In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental ammonia releases at the Aspen Distribution facility within the last five years (February 2002 - February 2007). \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAspen Distribution has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (RMP) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Victorville Fire Department and the local fire houses.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the City of Victorville Fire Department Hazardous Materials Division.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nAspen Distribution maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.

These studies were performed to define potential hazards associated with operational deviations of the ammonia system.\n\nThe Seismic Assessment performed on December 17, 2001, by a licensed structural engineer, also generated mitigation measures to improve the seismic adequacy of the refrigeration system and the building itself.  All recommendations are scheduled to be completed by December 2, 2002.  These recommendations were reviewed during the Seismic Revalidation on February 8, 2007, and all recommendations were complete.\n\nAspen Distribution is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP/CalARP and safety programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining PSM/RMP/CalARP and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
