The Executive Summary provides a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies 2. Stationary Source Activities 3. Regulated Substances Handled 4. Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios 5. Prevention Program 6. Five-Year Accident History 7. Emergency Response Program 8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety 9. Summary\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nTVMWD has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, \u00a72735-2785).  TVMWD is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The facility's staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia and chlorine for water treatment.\r\n\r\nTVMWD has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Chlorination and Ammoniation Systems.  TVMWD's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source Activities\r\n\r\nThe Plant is located at 1021 E. Miramar Avenue, Claremont, CA 91711.\r\n\r\nThe TVMWD Miramar Water Treatment Plant is located at 1021 Miramar Avenue, Claremont, CA 91711.  The regulated substances managed at the site are anhydrous ammonia and chlorine."

Anhydrous ammonia and chlorine are both vacuum regulated and injected for treatment of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Offsite Consequence Analysis Results Summary\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\n\r\nScenario Description: Per EPA and CalARP Regulations, worst-case release scenarios have been defined and modeled for anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\r\n\r\nScenario Description: Alternative release scenarios were modeled for anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Risk Considerations\r\n\r\nThe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine have inherent potential risks and the worst-case release scenarios result in consequences that can potentially reach the community.  TVMWD has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the safety practices of TVMWD personnel to extinguish the credibility of these worst-case scenarios, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an anhydrous ammonia or chlorine release:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety showers\r\n\u00bf\tRespiratory equipment\r\n\u00bf\tGas detection for anhydrous ammonia and chlorine\r\n\u00bf\tDiffusion"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of the CalARP/EPA RMP Program for the Chlorination System and the CalARP Program 2 for the Ammoniation System, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by TVMWD to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine for water treatment.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\r\n\r\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 4,400 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is under the 10,000 lbs threshold for both the EPA RMP and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia inventory is over the 500 lbs state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 2.\r\n\r\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 36,000 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 2,500 lbs threshold for EPA RMP, the 1,500 lbs threshold for Cal/OSHA PSM and the 100 lbs state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  As a result, the chlorine covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM.\r\n\r\nAlthough the amount of anhydrous ammonia is below the Federal Threshold, the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia are both managed as Program 3 substances.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tTraining\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\r\n\u00bf\tManag"
