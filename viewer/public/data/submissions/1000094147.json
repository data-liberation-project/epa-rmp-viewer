      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan has been developed and implemented at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in an effort to protect human health, to protect the environment and comply with applicable federal regulations.  This plant is operated by the City of Athens employees and owned by the Athens Municipal Water Authority (AMWA). The water treatment plant has a capacity to process 8.0 million gallons per day. The plant physical address is 4663 FM 2892, Athens, Henderson County, Texas.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has been developed to meet the standards published in the 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  These regulations were promulgated by the EPA to cover the accidental release prevention provision under the Clean Air Act 112(r)(7).  These regulations require facilities that exceed the cited threshold quantities for certain chemicals to develop a RMP.  The goal of a RMP is to focus on reducing the risk of accidental releases of certain chemicals; thereby, preventing harm to employees as well as potentially catastrophic impacts on the public.  \n\n\n\nEntrance to the WTP is controlled by fencing and locked gates.  The plant is located in a semi-remote area.  The plant is out of town but not out of the populace.  The WTP utilizes chlorine gas in its treatment process.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the WTP does not exceed the published threshold quantity as illustrated in Table 2 of 40 CFR Ch. 1 (7/1/98 edition) Part A? 68.130 A? List of Regulated Toxic Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention.  Table 2 illustrates the threshold quantity to be 10,000 lbs.  The AMWA WTP stores 5,172 lbs on site.  The one ton containers of chlorine gas are stored within are ASME coded vessels.  During the design and construction of this plant, the engineers used guidelines set forth by the National Chlorine Institute.  All external piping is protected from accidental damage by channel iron.  The feed equipment is inspected daily.  All personnel that work inside "

Each employee is required to attend a class on how to read and interpret a Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) within their first six months of service.  As a first responder each has been trained in the proper procedure to shut down the chemical feed systems, or report to the emergency response personnel.  The Athens Fire Department is responsible for writing all emergency response procedures, and coordinate all emergency responses.  A copy of the City of Athens emergency response program has been filed with the Henderson County emergency response coordinators office and is attached to the Risk Management Program document.   \n\n\n\nAll plant operators are required to know the locations of the emergency telephone numbers and names of individuals to contact in case of a release.  If an emergency occurs, each employee will have an assigned task.  This risk management program enhances the safety plan already in operation because it provides a clear checklist that identifies predetermined individuals and agencies that require notification and coordination.  This RMP details which individuals will respond to the release to stop it and outline the agencies responsible for evacuating appropriate areas, and for sounding the \"all clear\" once the leak is contained.  The plan also includes procedures for periodic review of readiness.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to maintain the plant's level of safety and retain a record verifying the proper training for Water Treatment Plant employees/operators.\n\n    \n\nProgram Level Determination\n\n\n\nThere are currently three program levels.

Facilities that fall into Program Level 3 are subject to OSHA regulations, exceed a threshold quantity and have potential off-site consequence or the industry has one of the specified Standard Industrial classification (SIC) codes.  Currently, municipalities are not subject to federal OSHA regulations, and Texas does not have a state OSHA equivalent.  The off-site consequence analysis (Reference Section 3) indicates that there could be off-site consequences if a chemical release of chlorine  occurred at the AMWA Water Treatment Plant; therefore, the facility falls in Program Level 2.\n\n\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\n\n\nThe regulations outline five specific requirements for Program Level 2 facilities.  By June 21, 1999, each facility covered under the Risk Management Program rule must have completed and submitted to the EPA a Risk Management Plan.  The EPA has requested that all submittals be transmitted electronically on their forms with appropriate figures or maps.  For reference, a copy of the form has been included within Section B- Hazard Assessment.  A facility in Program Level 2 must conduct a hazard analysis, develop a prevention plan, implement an emergency response plan, and report any chemical accidents that have occurred the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe AMWA WTP Risk Management Program Level 2 includes the following requirements:\n\n    \n\n    40 CFR A? 68.48   Safety Information \n\n    40 CFR A? 68.50   Hazard Review\n\n    40 CFR A? 68.52   Operating Procedures\n\n    40 CFR A? 68.54   Training \n\n    40 CFR A? 68.56   Maintenance\n\n    40 CFR A? 68.58   Compliance Audits\n\n    40 CFR A? 68.60   Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nToxicology/Physical Properties\n\n\n\nIt is imperative that employees/operators are informed about the physical properties and potential health hazards of the chemicals located at the facility.

In addition, chemical interaction information should be made available to all employees as well.\n\n\n\nChlorine\n\n\n\nChlorine is listed and regulated as an extremely hazardous chemical under Section 304 and can cause severe injury or death.  Chlorine is delivered to the WTP as liquefied compressed gas.  Chlorine gas is not explosive or flammable; however, it may support combustion.  It is a strong oxidizer and may react violently with substances such as water, ammonia, fuel oil, etc.  Chlorine gas is more dense than air  (vapor density= 2.49) and tends to settle in low areas.  It has a greenish-yellow color, and a strong pungent irritating odor with an odor threshold of approximately 3.5 ppm.  At standard temperature and pressure 1 ppm chlorine is equal to 2.76 milligrams per cubic meter in air.\n\n\n\nThe primary health hazard from chlorine exposure is damage to the respiratory system. It can also irritate the mucous membranes and targets the eyes, and skin.  In extreme cases, death by suffocation can result.  Frostbite may also occur if direct contact is made with liquefied chlorine.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lists 10-ppm chlorine in air as immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH).  NIOSH recommends a ceiling value of 0.5 ppm chlorine in air while OSHA regulations list 1.0-ppm chlorine in air as the ceiling value.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Worst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe EPA requires chemical stored that exceeds the threshold quantity, a \"worst case\" scenario should be performed to determine the off-site consequence of accidental release.  The EPA defines the \"worst case\" scenario as follows: The largest single vessel, container or pipe that contains the chemical \n\nof concern releases the entire contents as a gas when full during a ten \n\nminute time period.\n\n    \n\nThe definition also assumes th"
