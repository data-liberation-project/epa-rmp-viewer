Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe DFA-Cabool facility processes and packages dairy related products.  DFA has on site an ammonia refrigeration system used to maintain product freshness, to meet processing requirements, and to provide cooling for employee comfort.  DFA-Cabool is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68 because the refrigeration system contains more than the 10,000-pound threshold for ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance.\r\nDFA-Cabool has a refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) in an amount greater than the threshold under the Risk Management Program (RMP) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) according to Section 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68).  The refrigeration system is designed and operated according to good engineering and safe work practices.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe DFA-Cabool  ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.\r\n\r\nThe process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed. Staff is trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief de"

A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition. Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\r\nDFA-Cabool is equipped with an ammonia detection system with sensors located in the engine room and throughout the facility as appropriate. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nBased on an investigation into the accident history of the facility, there have been no reportable releases of ammonia over the past five years (September 2009 = September 2014).\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nDFA-Cabool has established an Emergency Response Program that provides for trained personnel on call in the event of a release.  DFA-Cabool is also coordinated with the Cabool Fire Department.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a release, we would immediately notify our affected employees, call 911, the Cabool Fire Departments and the Texas County LEPC who will contact the West Plains fire department HAZMAT team. Plant ammonia trained personnel will initiate emergency shutdown procedures. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific regulated substance safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
