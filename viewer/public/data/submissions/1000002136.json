The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Peco strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Bay Springs Fire Department and the Jasper County Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.\tTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of our facility is to process poultry, some of which is then temporarily stored refrigerated and/or frozen.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 62,025 pounds.  We have the capacity for more but do not run above 80% of"

It is assumed that the contents are released as a two phase flow (gas and aerosol-ALOHA).\r\nDistance to endpoint:  2.5 miles\r\n\r\nAlternative Scenario\r\nThe alternative scenario would be a release of approximately 3,731 pounds of ammonia.\r\nDistance to endpoint:  0.09 miles (157 yards)\r\n\r\n4.\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nTo date, this Peco facility has had one reportable accidental release.  This release resulted in no off-site injuries, deaths, or property damages.  The date of the release was May 11, 2012.  The amount released was calculated by an environmental engineering group, and the total amount released was finalized to be between 85 and 285 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n5.\tTHE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by William Gully III.  Mr. Gully will administrate in conjunction with the Peco management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Bay Springs Fire Department, the HAZMAT team and the Jasper County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\n6.\tTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Peco facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including EPAA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive On-The-Job training (OJT).  They are given oral tests and are observed by senior maintenance in order to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested and maintained to the standard of Internationa"

Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed and updated annually.  Our program is improved continuously through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available."
