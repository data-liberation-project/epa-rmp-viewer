Over  the  past  5\n\nyears, no RMPs incidents have occurred.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe  Los  Angeles  Refinery maintains  a  written  emergency\n\nresponse  program  which is in place to protect  worker  and\n\npublic  safety  as well as the process and the  environment.\n\nThe  program  consists of procedures  for  responding  to  a\n\nrelease  of a regulated substance, including the possibility\n\nof   a  fire  or  explosion  if  a  flammable  substance  is\n\naccidentally  released.  The procedures address  aspects  of\n\nemergency  response, including proper first-aid and  medical\n\ntreatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for\n\npersonnel  after  an  evacuation,  notification   of   local\n\nemergency  response agencies, the public, and post  incident\n\ncleanup  and  decontamination procedures.  In addition,  the\n\nrefinery    has   procedures   that   address   maintenance,\n\ninspection,   testing,   and  use  of   emergency   response\n\nequipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to\n\nperform  specific emergency response duties.  The  emergency\n\nresponse  program  is  updated  based  on  modifications  to\n\nrefinery  processes  or  other  refinery  facilities.    The\n\nemergency  response program is reviewed on an annual  basis.\n\nAffected  personnel are informed of and/or  trained  on  any\n\nchanges.\n\n\n\nThe  overall emergency response program for the Los  Angeles\n\nRefinery   is  coordinated  with  several  agencies.    This\n\nincludes   local   emergency   response   officials,   local\n\ngovernment  officials,  and industry  representatives.   The\n\nrefinery has around-the-clock communications capability with\n\nappropriate officials including the Fire Department and  Law\n\nEnforcement.

The refinery is also a member of\n\nthe Southern California Industrial Mutual Aid Organization.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA   blast-resistant  control  room  has  been   constructed,\n\nreplacing  older  control rooms that have less  advantageous\n\nfacility  siting aspects. This control room upgrade includes\n\na  prioritized  installation of Distributed Control  Systems\n\n(DCS)  to improve unit operability and reliability,  thereby\n\nreducing  the  potential for releases from unit  upsets  and\n\nshutdowns.  A  refinery-wide electrical system  upgrade  has\n\nbeen  completed with similar benefits to operational safety.\n\nOther  safety  enhancing projects underway  at  LAR  include\n\nstructural  member fireproofing upgrades and deluge  systems\n\nupgrades.\n\n\n\nLAR recently discontinued use of the vessel, located near  a\n\npopulated  fence-line, which had represented the worst  case\n\nscenario  for anhydrous ammonia.
