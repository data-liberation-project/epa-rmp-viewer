      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nAccidental Release Prevention \n\nNorthern California Power Agency (NCPA) Combustion Turbines has developed a Risk Management Program and an Emergency Response Plan to address RMP and CalARP Program requirements. NCPA Combustion Turbines has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Injection System. NCPA - Combustion Turbines' policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n NCPA Combustion Turbines is located at 12745 North Thornton Rd, Lodi, California 95242. The regulated substance at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 10,200 gallons (52,530 pounds [lbs]) and it is stored in a pressurized horizontal storage vessel at ambient temperature in liquid form. The amount of anhydrous ammonia corresponds to the 85% capacity of V-3401, as the facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum filling of the tanks to 85% of the capacity. When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a vaporizer is utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor. The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixing chamber where it is mixed with air. The resulting vapor ammonia / air stream is then injected into the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG). This, in conjunction with the catalyst within the HRSG, allow for the reduction of NOx and other unwanted materials being sent to the environment. The exhaust gas containing a lower concentration of NOx is then sent from the HRSG to an exhaust stack. \n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary: Per CalARP Regulations and US EPA RMP Regulations, one wor"

The results can be found in the 2023 Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\n Alternative Release Scenario Results Summary: An alternative release scenario was modeled. The results can be found in the 2023 Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\n Risk Considerations \n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; NCPA has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model). In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release, including the following automatic / manual shutdown, ammonia sensors in the process area, SCADA system, Continous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS), well designed relief system, safety showers/eye wash stations, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), the system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nKey Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by NCPA to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia. Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to"

The covered process has over the 10,000-lb threshold quantity for US EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities, and over the 500-lb state threshold for CalARP Program. As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, US EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM. \n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Prevention Program 3 elements include: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractors. In addition, key emergency response elements were addressed the Program.\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nFor any accidental release meeting the five-year accident history reporting criteria of 19 CCR \u00a72750.9 and 40 CFR \u00a7 68.36 , the owner or operator shall submit the data required under 19 CCR \u00a72745.5, \u00a72745.6, and \u00a72745.7 with respect to that accident within six months of the release or by the time the RMP is updated under 19 CCR \u00a72745.10, whichever is earlier. From 19 CCR \u00a72750.9: \"The owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident history all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\" There have been no RMP/CalARP-applicable releases of ammonia at NCPA Combustion Turbines in the past five years. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nNCPA \u0096 Combustion Turbines is a responding facility. The facility has implemented an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that meets applicable requirements for on-site emergencies. Employees are trained to extent needed for their responsibilities.
