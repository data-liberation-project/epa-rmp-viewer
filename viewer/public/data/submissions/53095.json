This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within their capabilities to minimize the risk to the public and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nFACILITY BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nStanley Gas Plant facility is located in a rural agricultural industry area in Mountrail County, North Dakota.  The Stanley Gas Plant facility is a natural gas processing facility which includes fixed and skid mounted natural gas processing equipment and natural gas liquids and propane storage tanks.  The facility is normally occupied by Pecan Pipeline North Dakota operations personnel.  The nearest potential receptors near the facility:\n1.    One occupied residence located approximately 6,864 feet to the north of the facility.\n2.    One occupied residence located approximately 11,616 feet to the southwest of the facility.\n3.    No occupied residence located east or west of the facility for approximately 34,000 feet or 6 miles..\n4.    Farming activities in the area of the facility are occupied on a seasonal basis.\n\nNo public receptors are within the area calculated for the worst case release scenario.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Stanley Gas Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address: chemical properties and associated hazards; limits for key process parameters and specific inventories; safety interlocks; suppression systems; ve"

      "SummaryText": "nt and relief studies; and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, flow, composition) in the equipment specifications and operating procedures. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Stanley Gas Plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Stanley Gas Plant have potential hazards that are managed for continued safe operation. The following is a description of current safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nThe facility has safety features to provide a means of containing /controlling a release, detecting a release, and reducing the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes: \n\nMonitoring and detection systems include (1) Hydrocarbon gas detectors to detect the presence of hydrocarbons, (2) Operations personnel on site provide routine surveillance, and (3) Visual warning alarms\n\nContainment and process controls include (1) Relief devices to avoid o"

Personnel are trained in procedures to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, and responding to small fires and other emergencies. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the facility has been reviewed with the local emergency response agencies."
