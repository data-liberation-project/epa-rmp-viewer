              "Description": "Morrilton Packing Company is a cold storage/warehousing facility.  This facility falls under the NAICS Cods 311612.  Our safety information was last reviewed on May 1, 2014 (safety meetings are also conducted every month).  We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  These standards, and all applicable OSHA requirements have been implemented here through written manuals with the assistance of Safety Solutions LLC.  The most recent hazard review was conducted on July 19, 2013. Completion of all changes resulting from last review are expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2014.  To aid in the prevention of releases, this facility uses standard operating and maintenance procedures for the refrigeration system, vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, and grounding equipment.   The refrigeration technicians of Morrilton Packing are trained in the classroom and by on-the-job training.  This training is completed by demonstration and observation of working knowledge of the system.  The training programs were last conducted in May 1, 2014 when Edward Ruff, Charles Ruff, Philip DeSalvo and Kim Schroeder completed the Hazardous Material Refresher Course given by Safety Solutions LLC.  \n\n  \n\nEmployees who are trained in the proper operating procedures of the ammonia refrigeration system are knowledgeable in the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Manual provided by the manufacturer.  Employees follow the start-up procedures to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.    The last review of maintenance procedures was completed July 29, 2014. However, employees perform daily and weekly visual inspections to check for abnormal operating conditions which may cause the release of ammonia from the system.    Different components of the refrigeration system are checked on a daily basis to ensure performance.  Compressors, accumulators, condensers, receivers, cold rooms, alarms, and purgers of the system are checked by use of a list.  This list has several different aspect of each component of the system.  For instance, the Compressors are checked for Suction Pressure, Suction Temperature, Discharge Pressure, Discharge Temperature, Oil Pressure, Oil Temperature, etc.  If any items noted on the checklist are not within the recommended operating zones, the maintenance personnel determine the cause and correct the problem, with the assistance of the O&M Manual.  Also, maintenance personnel conduct preventative maintenance on the system as scheduled, employing the aid of Baker Refrigeration as needed, to help prevent releases of anhydrous ammonia due to equipment failure.  Any work such as changing valves, seals, etc. are performed as needed.  Baker Refrigeration is an outside contractor who also helps to ensure the proper installation of system components if needed.\n\n\n\nMorrilton Packing Company is a Level 3 Prevention Program Facility, and is employing Process Safety Management at this location to help in the prevention of accidental releases from this facility.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nIn this cold storage facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold storage refrigerant chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of an incident.  Order of notification:  1)Safety Director (Charles Ruff), \n\n2) MPC Hazmat Responders, and 3) 911 Emergency System.  From there, 911 Emergency will notify the appropriate Hazmat Team (whether it be Russellville or Conway based on availability) as well as the Conway County LEPC. The Morrilton Fire Department and Morrilton Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems. \n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to cool and/or freeze storage compartments by utilizing anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a receiver in the engine room.  Anhydrous ammonia is fed into the cooling system for cold storage.  The system is a two-stage pump re-circulated ammonia refrigeration system.  The Hi Stage Compressor serves the Freezer Dock, Cooler, Cooler Dock and the Lo Stage Compressor discharge loads.  The Lo Stage system serves the freezer.  Other associated systems are the thermosyphon oil cooling for th"

Note:  The  system flow diagram and control wiring diagrams should be used in conjunction with this description. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the 51 Blue Diamond Drive location is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 13,000 pounds.  This amount is an aggregate found in the storage vessel, as well as the entire cold storage system.\n\n\n\nThis cold storage facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\n\n\nWe have discussed this program with the Conway County LEPC, the Conway County Sheriff's Office, the Morrilton Police Department, as well as the Morrilton, Russellville and Conway Fire Departments (Haz Mat Teams). \n\n\n\nThe cold storage system was originally constructed in 1986, and underwent additions in 1999. This facility is striving to be in compliance with all applicable regulations applicable to this facility.\n\n"
