      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION:  The Ozark Division of Cooper Natural Resources Inc. has produced the industrial mineral, sodium sulfate, from underground brine deposits in west Texas since 1933.  Their Cedar Lake Plant, located in northeastern Gaines County, has been in operation since 1965.  The sodium sulfate produced by the plant is a high purity, non-hazardous salt that is shipped to customers throughout the United States for use in the detergent, glass, paper, dyestuffs and animal husbandry industries.  The plant is supplied by shallow wells located in the highly saline, Cedar Lake.  The produced brine is over nine times the salinity of seawater.  This brine is conveyed to the plant by pipelines.  Refrigeration units in the plant then cool the brine to precipitate the hydrous Glauber's salt.  The refrigeration system contains approximately 67,000 lbs of ammonia (anhydrous).  The hydrous salt is then recovered by filtration and sent to the drying plant where a vapor recompression unit melts the salt in its waters of hydration.  Concentration of the saturated solution results in precipitation of anhydrous sodium sulfate, the marketable product.  The anhydrous sodium sulfate is subsequently recovered by centrifuges and dried prior to shipment.  The operation is based on simple phase chemistry alone and no reagents or reactive chemistries are used in the process.  PROGRAM STATUS: The plant meets the eligibility requirements of Program 1 status as provided in 68.12(b) of the RMP Rule because it meets all of the following: 1) For the past five years the process has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the sustance led to any of the following offsite consequences (i) death; (ii) injury; or (iii) response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor: 2) The d"

      "SummaryText": "istance to a toxic or flammable endpoint for a worst-case release assessment conducted under Subpart B and 68.25 of this part is less than the distance to any public receptor, as defined in 68.30 of this part; and (3) Emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the stationary source and local emergency planning and response organizations.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT, RELEASE SCENARIOS:  A Hazard Assessment has been conducted on the facility under the guidelines of Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: Because anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance, the plant is also covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM).  Additionally, the plant submits an annual \"TIER II\" to the State Emergency Response Commission, the Gaines County LEPC and the two local fire departments. The TIER II report lists all hazardous chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia, that may be held above the threshold quantity at the plant.  The report also describes the chemical properties and location of each chemical in the plant in order to assist emergency responders should they ever be called to the facility.  Potential releases at the facility are prevented by well-maintained equipment and well-trained personnel.  Plant personnel receive annual ammonia training.  The plant is required to report any ammonia spills exceeding 100 lbs, which is the Reprtable Quantity of ammonia.  These reports are made to State and Federal regulatory agendies.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental releases with offsite consequences, as defined in 68.10(b)(1), see eligibility status above, at the facility within the past five years.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  The Cedar Lake Plant is prepared to respond to any potential accidents involving ammonia. A disaster drill is held annually in cooperation with the Gaines County Sheriff's Dept., the local fire departments and E"

Also, a copy of this Risk Management Plan will be supplied to the local fire departments as well as the Gaines County LEPC.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  The potential risks of ammonia are taken seriously at our plant where training and retraining of our employees is an on-going activity.   The safety of both our employees and neighbors will continue to be our number one priority at Cooper Natural Resources."
