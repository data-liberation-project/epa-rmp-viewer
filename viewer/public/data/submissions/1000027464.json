Accidents are preventable through identification and elimination of causes.  Two of the most obvious causes of accidents are an unsafe act and unsafe condition.  Basic casues of unsage acts and unsafe conditions can be aidentified and eliminated through engineering, education and enforcement.  Some basic casuse are deficiencies in training, supervision, attitude and procedure of work-place .

When accidents involving dangerous chemicals occur, the Department of Public Safety or the Parish President will decide when Parish employees are needed.  A Parish supervisor will be called to report to the Civil Defense command post at the scene of the accident.

Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are the RMP-listed chemicals ( over the TQ value) which are handled by St. John the Baptist Parish.  Each plant carries between 2 to 8 tons of chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide to treat our waste or potable water.  St. John the Baptist utilizes these chemicals in the pressurized liquid form for sterilizing and disinfecting water supply systems and sanitary waste treatment discharges.  It has been used for many years by the Parish without any serious impact on anyone.

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PERVENTION STEPS  St. John the Baptist Parish follows NFPA 58 based on state laws, OSHA and ASTM standards for complying with all PLant safety requirements.  Safety and training meetings are held on a routine monthly basis or more often if needed.  Employees are encourged to add recommendations and suggestions for safety topics or personal concerns dealing with the safe handling of chemicals or equipment.  Whe dealing with chlorine, the Parish employees use the following steps.                                       (1)  Two (2) ment work on chlorine equipment at all times.                                                                                                    (2) One (1) operator goes to the chlorintator area with respirator properly fitted and on face.                                                     (3) Second operator stands back with resirator properly fitted and on face, plus he carries two (2) five (5) minute air packs in case of a chlorine leak.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY   St. John Parish has had one reportable accidient at any five covered facilities. In November of 1996, and accident occurred releasing thirteen (13) pounds of gaseous chlorine due to a untightened lead washer on the cylinder valve.
