Emergency response policies include mitigation when possible within the abilities and training of the plant staff.  Should these efforts be insufficient, further intervention would be in active cooperation with community planners and first responders.  \r\n\r\nOnce every two years, the local fire department is invited to facility for training and familiarization where new drawings and updates are given to them for review and comments.   The updated documents are also provided to Iowa DNR for the SARA Title III report and to the local emergency response team annually.\r\n\r\nTwo aqua ammonia tanks exist that hold up to 223,800 pounds of 29% Aqua Ammonia at ambient temperature.  Distribution piping containing 29% Aqua Ammonia contributes a negligible amount of additional volume. \r\n\r\nSethness Products Company has had no accident history to report for aqua ammonia in the last five years.  \r\n\r\nThe programs in place to prevent releases focus primarily on prevention by design, maintenance, and procedures.  The facility personnel work in concert to ensure that design and system components are optimized for safe operation.  All proposed changes are reviewed by plant engineering staff to ensure that system integrity is not compromised.  During this review, all activities such as inspection or maintenance are specified and integrated into plant operations.  Consultants and approved contractors can be utilized to both review designs and design sys"

      "SummaryText": "tems as needed.  In addition to our safety program based on Job Hazard Analysis, the facility is in compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) rules in regards to aqua ammonia.  The plant safety program assures that management, engineering, and operations are informed of the hazards posed by 29% Aqua Ammonia, and the actions required to maintain the system in safe condition.  The safety program has the full support of labor and management.\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event of a release, facility personnel would assess the seriousness of the problem and take appropriate action.  Actions would include evacuation of the facility, containing spills, notification of emergency first responders, and if required, a call for help to the Quad Cities Hazardous Materials Team.  In order to provide rapid response to an issue with aqua ammonia, Sethness employees have been trained in the early detection of small leaks and catastrophic events that could result in large releases.  Employees, upon detection of incidental leak conditions, have training and equipment to make emergency repairs.  In the event of catastrophic failure due to a flood or vessel failure, activation of the community response plan would be the primary response.  \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is designed to assure the safety of employees.  The EAP training is for all employees upon employment.  Refresher training is communicated via classroom training annually.  Changes to EAP are sent to management team to train within their department as they are made.  Once safety of personnel is assured, abatement of the release will be addressed.  Preventing hazardous concentration of vapors and exposure to vapors are the primary goals.  This will be accomplished by repairing faulty or damaged equipment, or providing a temporary repair with high priority for permanent repair.   All hot work trainees are informed of the dangerous situation of ammonia gas that can be present when concentrated.  Hot work is not allowed"

Should the problem have the potential to be beyond the capability or training of facility personnel, further mitigation and response will be coordinated with local first responders and (if necessary) an approved emergency response contractor.\r\n\r\nSethness Products is open 24 hrs per day, 7 days per week.   We have complete shutdowns for certain holidays, but a member from maintenance inspects and records important information in person at facility 365 days per year.  Inspection of aqua ammonia containment is one of these items.\r\n\r\nWe have added new positons that focus on regulatory affairs, document control, and safety programs.  Resulting in improving the focus on regulations and safety in day to day activities. In addition to the new positions, we have added an employee suggestion box where any employee can report concerns or recommendations for improvements.  This information is shared with the safety committee which is a group of individuals both in management and hourly from various departments on a monthly basis.  Finally, in March 2015 we commissioned a diesel powered generator to provide the production side of the facility power in case of emergency to safely shutdown systems."
