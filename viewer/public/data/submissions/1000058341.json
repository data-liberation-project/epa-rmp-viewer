Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is an advanced distribution company providing customers worldwide with products, chemicals and advanced materials.  Our major operations are located in the Midwest and employ approximately 245 people.\r\n\r\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC (Brenntag) facility, located in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is a chemical distribution facility with an NAICS code of 42469.  Three (3) of the chemicals handled at the facility trigger RMP threshold values.  These chemicals include Toluene Diisocyanate - Mixed Isomers (TDI), Cyclohexylamine, and Ethyl Ether.  The TDI storage process was previously reported to be a Program Level 1 process.  Cyclohexylamine and Ethyl Ether are being reported in this Risk Management Plan submittal as Program Level 2 processes.  A release of Cyclohexylamine has been determined to be the worst-case toxic release scenario.  An alternative release scenario is also included in this submittal for Cyclohexylamine.  A vapor cloud explosion has been determined to be the worst-case flammable liquid release scenario.  An alternative release scenario from a vapor cloud fire is included for Ethyl Ether.\r\n\r\nIt is the worldwide policy of Brenntag to design, blend and distribute its products, and to manage those products throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.
