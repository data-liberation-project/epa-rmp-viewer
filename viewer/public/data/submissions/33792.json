However, it should be noted that each chlorine cylinder connected to a chlorine feed manifold is provided with a chlorine leak detection system and an automatic valve shut system (ROBO Control System), the maximum quantity of chlorine that could be released is expected to be limited to a very small quantity.

EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, temperate of 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), and average humidity (50%) were used.\n\nWhen analysis of the worst-case scenario was performed using RMP* Comptm model and using the EPA assumptions and considering release of chlorine gas in an enclosed space, a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 10,806 was obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the break or rupture of the flexible connections (pigtails) or valves connected to two (2) one-ton cylinders, possibly due to corrosion.  The amount of chlorine released is 4,000 lbs, at an average rate over one hour (the duration of the release) of 67 lbs/min.  Toxic endpoint distance to ERPG-2 levels was obtained.  The typical meteorological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed 3 m/s, average air temperature of 25\u00b0C, and 50% average humidity.  The estimated distances traveled to the toxic endpoints are 0.1 miles for the ERPG-2 and an estimated residential population potentially affected of 34 was obtained.\n\nSince the chlorine cylinder weighing room and the chlorine feeding system/chlorinators are located within the room, enclosure is considered as a passive mitigation system.  Actuation of the chlorine detector is an active mitigation measure considered.  An additional mitigation system, LBCJMA has installed chlorine leak detection and automatic valve shut off valve, a vacuum type chlorination system, with all pressurized chlorine gas piping replaced with vacuum piping.

The LBCJMA accident release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The LBCJMA\u00bfs emergency response policy plans are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and are in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe chlorination system has been installed at the LBCJMA Water Filtration Plant to provide prechlorination and post chlorination for disinfection purpose.  The LBCJMA Water Filtration Plant (also referred to as Water Treatment Plant) provides portable water supply to Tullytown Borough and portions of Bristol Township, Middletown Township and Falls Township.  The chlorination facility is located within the LBCJMA Water Filtration Plant.  The chlorination system installed is a vacuum type with vacuum piping.  The chlorination system is installed in a room.  The chlorination facility is designed to place and connect four chlorine cylinders to the wall mounted vacuum regulator.  However, only two one-ton chlorine cylinders are turned on.  The chlorine facility is equipped with five (5) leak detection and automatic chlorine shut of systems (ROBO Control).  Each chlorine cylinder located in the weighing room connected to the chlorine feed manifold is provided with leak detection and automatic cylinder valve shut off system.  One leak detection and automatic valve shut off control is also installed with manifold to automatically shut off the main valve located on the manifold line.  Generally, there are eight (8) cylinders which are stored in a chlorine cylinder storage area.  The chlorination facility is normally unmanned.  The Water Treatment Plant operators visit the facili"
