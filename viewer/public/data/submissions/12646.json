Box 550\nBethlehem, GA 30620\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including \nemployees that Harrison Poultry, Bethlehem, GA is \ncomplying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard \n(called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of \nFederal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk \nManagement Program regulations (called RM Program), Title \n40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the \nstorage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. \nIn this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public \nsafety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the \noccurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant \nreleases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, \nand other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these \nprograms prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and \nillnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving \nhazardous chemicals including any use, storage, \nmanufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such \nchemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of \nvessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which \nare located such that a hazardous chemical could be \ninvolved in a potential release shall be considered a \nsingle process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on \nthe rules, procedures, and practices which govern \nindividual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. \nThese rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They \nare also communicated to and accepted by all employees at \nthe facility.\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 14,550 lbs. \nof ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 80 % of \nthe vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a \nten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, \nammonia could travel 2.2 miles before dispersing enough to \nno longer pose a hazard to th"

This scenario is \nunlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather \nconditions are uncommon; the vessel located in a protected \narea below the evaporative condensers, was recently installed \nwith all new valves and piping to industry standards for the \nmanufacture and quality control of pressure vessels, thus a\nmechanical failure is unlikely; ammonia is not corrosive in \nthis service; pressure safety valves limit operating \npressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in \nplace at the facility including the mechanical integrity \nprogram for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, \nand replacement of equipment, if necessary; and the emergency \nresponse plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nFailure of a compressor high pressure cutout switch causes a safety \nvalve to release ammonia to the atmosphere at a rate of 26 lbs. per\nmin. for 60 minutes before detection and control, resulting in a \n1560 lbs. release of ammonia. Under common weather conditions, ammonia\ncould travel .1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a \nhazard to the public. This particular case was chosen as an alternative \nscenario because of the number of compressors with pressure switches \nthat could be struck or possibly mechanically fail. This scenario is \nunlikely for the following reasons: travel and activity within the\ncompressor room is restricted; the facility accident prevention program \nin place including operating procedures to have maintenance personnel \npresent 24 hours per day, and the mechanical integrity program for regular\nmaintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment,\nif necessary; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place \nat the facility.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere were two reportable accidents in the past five years. \nOnly one resulted in minor injury to one worker.\n\nOn July 6, 1999, a holiday period, 125 lbs. was released during a \n10 minute interval with no known risk"
