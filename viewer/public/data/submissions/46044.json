The parcel is desribed as being in the northeast 1/4 of section 5, township 18N Range 26E. The subject site consists of approx. 13 acres, bounded by residential property to the west, south and east. The Auburn 7.5 Minute Quadrangle Topographic Map, USGS 1983 shows the elvation at the site to be approx.600 feet above sea level. The surface water flow is in a souhtly direction towards a tributary of lake Wilmore. The plant treat water form Lake Olgetree for use as potable water for the city od Auburn, AL. Chlorine gas is used treat the water to reduce bacterial contamination. The chlorine gas process is isolated to reduce the probability of an incident and the operators are thoroughly trained in the handling of the one ton cylinders of chlorine. A review of the process indicated that the worst case secenario is the release of a one ton cylinder that is being place into service. The release would allow chlorine to migrate off site to the south southeast, along a natrual drainage fall line toward a residential area. The envelope of exsposure will be some 1.1 miles. The most likely alternative scenario is the release of a partally full cylinder, containing less the a ton of chlorine, with the flow pattern and traveling .42 miles. In both cases the emergency response involves the activation of the Emergency Response Program and the potential evacuation of the residents. The site has a prevention program in place that addresses the following program elements: Hazard review, SOP, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation and Compliance Auditing. These programs are used for the entire operation and for the specific use of chlorine. The site has had no incidents in the last five years and has an ERP that involves local public safety and HAZMAT teams. In the furture the site plans on removing chlorine gas and repl"
