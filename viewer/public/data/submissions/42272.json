The regulated substance under the RMP Rule is Anhydrous Ammonia  \n\nwhich is used in the refrigeration system. The process is a closed loop system to maintain temperature in the facility production and storage areas. \n\n\n\nQuantity:\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains 23,000 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia on site as an operating level for the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nChemical Hazards for:        Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nPermissible Exposure Limit--25 PPM for 8 hours\n\nShort Term Exposure Limit--35 PPM for 15 minutes\n\nImmediately Dangerous to Life or Health--300 PPM\n\nInhalation Hazard--1,000 PPM\n\nSkin Absorption Hazard--10,000 PPM\n\nLower Explosive Limit--16%\n\nUpper Explosive Limit--25%\n\nEPA Toxic Endpoint--200 PPM\n\nDOT Classification:--Non-flammable gas\n\nUnited Nations Number:--UN 1005\n\n\n\nWorst-case Scenario for a toxic substance:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release toxic endpoint was determined using EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration' reference tables and equations. \n\nThis scenario was based on the following criteria:\n\n\n\nVessel:                         High Pressure Receiver (HPR) 54\" x 18' 0\"\n\nAmount Released:        10,000 lbs.\n\nDuration of Release:     10 minutes\n\nRelease Rate:               1000 lbs/min\n\nWind Speed:                 1.5 meter/sec\n\nAtmospheric Stability:   F\n\nTopography:                 Urban\n\nPassive Mitigation:        Building Enclosure\n\n\n\nThe toxic endpoint was calculated taking into consideration building enclosure as passive mitigation. The enclosure measures 38' x 38' x 18' and \n\nhas one exhaust fan rated at 3,000 cfm producing approximately 7 room air exchanges per hour. Referencing the tables in Chapter Four of the \n\n\"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", the toxic endpoint would be a radius of 0.6 miles. Affected within this radius is a population"

Affected within this area is 97 people. Also affected are several businesses and residences. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nSmith Dairy has established an in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. The \n\nestablished steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER'. The facility has also established annual \n\nretraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees \n\nare prepared in the event of an emergency. Smith Dairy has also established training with the Fire Department personnel and community Local \n\nEmergency Planning Committee. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to \n\ndate.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nSmith Dairy has trained the refrigeration operators and selected production and office personnel in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency "
