      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Rome Terminal consists of sixteen (16), 30,000 Gallons water capacity tanks. All the storage tanks are mounded. The terminal has two bulkheads designed to load/unload the product from the transports into the storage tanks and vice-versa. The facility has two Compressors. Each propane tanks have excess flow valves, two vapor lines and valves and one liquid line and valves that are above the ground.\n\n\n\nWhen unloading liquid propane from the transports, the compressor receives the vapor from the storage tank being filled and passes it through the compressor, then pushes it into the transport, increasing the vapor pressure in the transport. The increased vapor pressure forces the liquid in the transport through the liquid piping to the storage tanks. \n\nWhen loading transports, compressor receives the vapor from storage tank and passes it through the compressor, then pushes it in the storage tank, increasing its pressure. The increased vapor pressure forces the liquid in the storage tank out through the liquid valves and through the liquid piping to the transport.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our operations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. The Facility has Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Supervisor who are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around t"

The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst Case Scenario \n\nFor flammables, vapor cloud explosion is specified as worst case scenario. Worst case scenario is analyzed by estimating distance to an over pressure endpoint of 1 psi resulting from vapor cloud explosion of a cloud containing largest quantity of regulated substance from a vessel or process pipe failure. Per CFR 68.25.b.1, \"For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\" is the worst case scenario. The Bulk propane tanks at the Rome terminal are all mounded tanks with only porting of piping with Emergency Shutoff Valves and Pressure Safety Valves exposed.\n\n\n\nA sustained release from relief valves of a 30, 000 gallons bulk tank as result of overfilling and over pressure of the bulk tanks was considered as the worst case scenario. The release of propane through relief valve at a rate of 1510 lbs. /min for 10 minutes was chosen as criteria. The total quantity released was 15,100 lbs. The propane was assumed to disperse in the flammable range, encounter areas of sufficient congestion and confinement and result in a vapor cloud explosion.  Per calculations, Using equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis), the calculated distance to 1 psi over pressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.20 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nFor alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was considered. The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. Using equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis), the calculated distance to 1 psi over pressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\n\n\n\nEmergency Respon"

The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations. \n\nNotification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel. If an actual incident occurs, the plan gives guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site. Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility has no plans at the present time to make any changes.\n\n"
