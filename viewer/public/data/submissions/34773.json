      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Henderson Community Coop in Lushton are strongly committed to employee, public, and evironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Henderson Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in a 30,000 gallon tank.  The maximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (131,325 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank (131,325 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles.  The estimated population within a 1.12 mile radius of this facility is 200.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The scenario involves the release of 7,200 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 2.0 minutes.  Undesr neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is .46 mile.  The estimated population within a .46 mile radius of the facility is 25.\n\n4.

The following sections briefly describe  the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHenderson Community Coop maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facililty conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nHenderson Community Coop maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nHenderson Community Coop has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these process.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHenderson Community Coop conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include: pressure vessels, storag tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiences identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Henderson Community Coop to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and "

Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose jobs tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\nHenderson Community Coop routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prio to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nHenderson Community Coop conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nHenderson Community Coop truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nHendserson Community Coop has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nHenderson Community Coop maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public (Appendix A)."
