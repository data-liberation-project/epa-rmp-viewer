The plant uses chlorine as to disinfect wastewater to maintain public health and receiving stream water quality.\n \nThe waste water is biologically treated then disinfected via chlorination.  In the disinfection process, a chlorinator mixes chlorine gas with water to make a chlorine solution.  The treated wastewater is allowed to mix with the chlorine solution in a contact chamber, killing pathogens that are dangerous to humans, animals and aquatic life that remain after biological treatment.\n\nChlorine is a regulated toxic chemical by 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore any process utilizing over 2,500 pounds of chlorine must implement Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Belmont Water Pollution Control Facility stores a maximum of three one-ton chlorine cylinders (approximately 6,000 pounds of chlorine) and is therefore subject to RMP requirements.  The storage of chlorine also makes the facility subject to OSHAA?s Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nThe worst case, toxic release scenario is a release of gas from a single 2,000 pound cylinder in ten minutes.  The alternative toxic release scenario is a slower release approximated as a leak evacuating a cylinder in a total of 100 minutes.  Again, this would involve a release of 2,000 pounds, over longer period of time.  These releases could affect local populations.\n\nTo prevent toxic releases of chlorine, the facility complies with the OSHA PSM standard.  All tenets of the Process Safety Management Program are included by reference into this RMP.\n\nAspects of the release prevention program include written operations procedures, inspections of equipment, employee training, automatic shutoff equipment, and a chlorine gas detection monitor and alarm.  As a testament to these programs, the Belmont Water Pollution Control Facility has not had a chlorine release in th"
