The table below provides a summary of the units which use them and some final products which they can be found. \n\nRMP Chemical                   Operating Unit(s)                    End Uses\n Oleum                               Caprolactam I & II                 Nylon fibers and plastics\n Ammonia (Anhydrous)     Caprolactam I & II                 Fertilizers, Nylon plastics\n                                           Cyclohexanone I & II           \n                                           Hydroxylamine                                                                                                  \nFormaldehyde                    Neol?, railcar                    Water craft, appliance, and automotive coatings Propylene/Propane           Oxo Alcohols                    Plastic coatings, Paints\n                                           Acrylic Acid\nTrimethylamine                  Neol?

Specialized oil and foam spill blanket systems and a scrubber system provide a protective barrier in the event of a spill.          \n? As with other chemicals of concern, ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic shut-off and relief devices to handle fluctuations in temperature and pressure.  Warning alarms, leak detectors, regular equipment inspections, and pressure monitoring in pipes and vessels provide layers of protection for employees and the community.\n? The formaldehyde storage tank is equipped with a spill pit to contain the contents of any accidental liquid releases.  The tank is also equipped with a water-fog system to control vapor releases.  Automatic shut-off devices, relief valves, and safety alarms provide additional protection.  Water curtains are available for railcar incidents.  \n? Chemical flammability is a great concern for BASF, and many steps are taken to prevent accidental releases.  Thermal relief and automatic shut-off systems are incorporated into process designs.  Systems are in place to quickly relocate or dispose of flammables in emergency situations.  Continuous monitoring of pipe and vessel pressure identify potential leaks for further protection.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThis facility has had no accidental releases from a covered process over the past five years, which meets the reporting criteria under 40 ?CFR 68.42(a).  \n\nEmergency Response Program\nEmergency response programs are in place for both internal preparation and coordination with the community.  The Freeport site plan is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure community safety.  Annual drills are coordinated with the community and the community warning sirens are tested weekly.  In the event of an incident, information is transmitted over a local radio station.  BASF participates in the Industrial CAER program (Community Awarenes"

In addition to the site plan, each operating unit has a block specific emergency plan.  These plans contain information specific to chemicals within that unit.  Incident commander training is conducted annually and two drills are staged each year.  Information on emergency health care is incorporated into the unit emergency plans.  BASF also maintains a corporate-wide Emergency Response Team that is expertly trained in emergency mitigation techniques for transportation and off-site incidents.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, etc."
