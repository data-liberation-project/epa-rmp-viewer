This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the Woodland Generation Station (WGS).  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the aqueous ammonia process.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  MID has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the process equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at WGS.    \r\n\r\nIn addition, MID has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP), which details the response WGS will take as a result of an uncontrolled release of aqueous ammonia.  The EAP includes procedures for evacuating personnel from the area where the emergency is located and notifying local emergency responders.  The EAP is maintained current and updated periodically.\r\n\r\nMID has coordinated with local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the aqueous ammonia process and with the general safety and accidental release program at WGS.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nMID operates WGS, which generates electric power provided to customers in the surrounding area.  WGS is located at 1240 Graphics Avenue in Modesto, Stanislaus County, California.  The facility is situated on the southeast corner of Woodland Avenue and Graphics Avenue, approximately 0.2 miles east of Highway 99.  The property is surrounded by industrial facilities and commercial businesses to the east, north, and west, and vacant land to the south. \r\n\r\nWGS is equipped with two gas turbine engine powered generators (referred to as WGS Units 1 and 2), six internal combustion reciprocating engine powered electrical generators (referred to as WGS Unit 3), and associated eq"

The chemical is stored in an aboveground storage tank.  The maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia stored at a given time is 12,600 gallons (94,500 pounds) of solution.  At 29% concentration, the mixture contains approximately 27,400 pounds of ammonia, which exceeds the EPA Risk Management Program threshold of 20,000 pounds for concentrations 20 percent or greater and the CalARP Program threshold of 500 pounds of ammonia in solution; therefore, this process is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and CalARP Program regulations. The aqueous ammonia process at WGS qualifies for Program Level 2.\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia is used at the WGS in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to control emissions of NOx from natural gas combustion. Aqueous ammonia is vaporized and injected into the exhaust gas stream from WGS Units 1 and 2 and then passed through a catalyst bed. At WGS Unit 3, however, aqueous ammonia is sprayed into the exhaust stream in liquid form and is vaporized and mixed directly in the exhaust before entering the SCR grid. In the presence of the catalyst, the ammonia and NOx react to form nitrogen and water vapor, thereby reducing NOx emissions.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nMID has developed a RMP/CalARP Program for the aqueous ammonia process. The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\r\n\u00bf\tSafety Information that describes the hazards of aqueous ammonia and the process in which aqueous ammonia is used.  This includes the chemical safety data sheet, process description, operating limits, equipment specifications, and the codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process.\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Review to identify the hazards associated with the aqueous ammonia process and to evaluate the engineering and administrative safeguards in place to eliminate or reduce those hazards.\r\n\u00bf\tOper"

In addition, there have been no releases of aqueous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nMID has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.

Employees are trained on the EAP procedures initially upon hire and receive annual refresher training.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an aqueous ammonia release, the highest-ranking WGS operations person onsite will assess whether the release is controllable (i.e., incidental and easily controlled) or uncontrollable. If the release is controllable, trained WGS personnel will perform the tasks necessary to accomplish containment and mitigation of the release. If the release is uncontrollable, the MID Control Center will notify the Modesto Fire Department. The Modesto Fire Department will handle spill/release response and mitigation.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan is shared with the Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources through the annual submission of the Hazardous Materials Business Plan. MID also works closely with the Modesto Fire Department to coordinate response actions inviting fire department staff to tour WGS and the aqueous ammonia system. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nHazard Reviews and Compliance Audits have been performed on the aqueous ammonia process, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at WGS.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  MID has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.  In addition, MID plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures and conducting reviews and audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."
