The hazardous materials at this facility that meet the CalARP eligibility requirements are sulfur dioxide and ammonia. As per Section 2735.4 (Applicability) of the CalARP program, the Napa Hazardous Materials Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) and this facility have determined that these material processes meet the eligibility requirements of Program Level 3 and Level 2, respectively. As required by Article 5 for Program Level 2 and Article 6 for Level 3 of the CalARP Program, the applicable prevention components are\n\ndetailed in this single document.\n\n\n\nThis Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating and implementing our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and other matters addressed in the OSHA standard. This program has been developed to enable all those who may be affected to be able to identify and understand the hazards posed by the processes that involve the covered chemicals.\n\n\n\nOur Program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee p"
