The Hutchinson Rail Terminal complies with National Fire Protection Association NFPA-58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code requirements for LP-Gas Storage, NFPA 30 Flammable Liquids Code, and it is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy to notify the Reno County Office of Emergency Management and the Hutchinson City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:  The Hutchinson Terminal is a bulk liquefied petroleum gas terminal that can receive natural gas liquids (NGLs), butanes, propane, and other hydrocarbon products via pipeline.  Butanes, and propane are stored at the Hutchinson Rail Terminal and loaded on railcars for distribution to customers.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal has developed and implemented the all the elements of the EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements, Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulations.

Accurate and complete process safety information enables the Hutchinson Rail Terminal employees involved in operating and maintaining the terminal to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  Process safety information is used to conduct process hazard analysis on the existing process or a proposed modification to a process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal is committed to performing a detailed hazard analysis of each covered process to identify, evaluate, and control hazards involved in the processes.  Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\nThe Hutchinson Rail Terminal uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and check list PHA methodologies, which are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, engineering expertise and PHA facilitator training.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and / or mitigation measures.\n\nAs a minimum the Hutchinson Rail Terminal performs periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 years as long as the process is operating.\nPHA findings and recommendations and their resolution are documented.  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner.

The Hutchinson Rail Terminal written operating procedures state the operating limits including the consequences of deviation and the steps required to correct or avoid the deviation.  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal written operating procedures describe all the process safety systems and their functions.  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal written operating procedures are reviewed and certified annually for current practices and accuracy.\n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures:  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal has developed and implemented safe work practices in accordance with the OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 requirements that include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined space entry permits and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed into a permit required confined space.\n\nTraining:  The Hutchinson Rail Terminal has developed and implemented formal operator and maintenance training programs.  Initial training ensures that new or reassigned personnel are trained in an overview of the process and operating procedures.  Refresher training is performed at least every three (3) years to ensure that the operator understands and adheres to"
