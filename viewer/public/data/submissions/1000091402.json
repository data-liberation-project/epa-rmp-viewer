Generally for us, a significant chlorine release is likely to last for up to one hour before it is contained.  Therefore, sheltering in place is the normal mode to be utilized during an emergency. While it is unlikely that this facility could have a chlorine release requiring evacuation, nevertheless, we must be prepared for such an eventually. If it is anticipated that a release cannot be soon contained or is of a massive quantity, the evacuation option should be utilized.

All employees at CWP are trained in chlorine containment procedures and all are trained in the use of SCBA equipment.\r\n\r\n2-TYPES OF EMERGENCY\r\na. Chlorine Release\r\nIn the event of an equipment or human failure, potential sources for chlorine releases are:\r\n1. One Ton chlorine Container\r\n2. Chlorine supply lines and chlorination equipment.\r\nAt this facility, the loss of any utilities including electricity will not increase the potential for a chlorine release.\r\n\r\n3-SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this plan includes:\r\na. A chlorine release contained within the plant facilities and controllable by\r\nCUWCD personnel and equipment.\r\nb. A chlorine release affecting or with the potential to affect the area surrounding the\r\nCUWCD; such a release would require outside assistance.\r\n\r\n4-PLANNING FOR HANDLING THE EMERGENCY\r\nResponsibility:\r\nThe Plant Manager is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the plan. He is responsible for keeping the plan current and insuring that all plant employees are properly trained.\r\nInitiating the ER (Emergency Response Plan)\r\nThe ERP is initiated by any employee at any time in response to a known or perceived chlorine release. Initiating employee will notify all other personnel at the plant (if any) by best means possible (i.e. intercom, cell phone, two way radio, or in person).\r\n4.2 Assembly Area\r\nPrimary --Control Room\r\nSecondary --Front Gate Area\r\nUpon receiving notification, each employee is to secure his job and report to the primary assembly area (Control Room).
