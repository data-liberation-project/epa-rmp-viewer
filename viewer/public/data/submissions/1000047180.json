Personnel working with hazardous materials are trained in the safe operating procedures, the proper\r\nutilization of safety equipment and safeguards, as well as maintenance techniques required to operate the process in a safe and efficient manner. \r\n\r\nWPJWA's Treatment Plant is a water treatment facility that utilizes chlorine in its' treatment process.  The chlorine is contained\r\ninside a brick structure (chlorine scale room) in six one ton cylinders.  Up to 20 one ton cylinders can be kept on the outside\r\nstorage rack adjacent to the scale room.  This area is secured by an eight foot fence with barb wire on top.  Empties are \r\nstored on a outside rack.  The six in-use cylinders are positioned horizontally on three double tank mechanical scales.  Our Treatment plant employs a pressure operated, dry gas feed system with manual switchover. One cylinder on each scale is active.\r\nWhen a cylinder is put into service, the chlorine gas passes through a pressure reducing valve to its respective chlorinator located in the third floor feed room.  The plant operators adjust the chlorinators to a desired feed rate which produces an appropriate mixture of domestic water and chlorine for application at the desired feed point along the treatment scheme.  The mixture travels through a soluton line to its' application point where it is injected into the treated water.\r\n\r\nThe WPJWA Treatment Plant has implemented a prevention program to reduce the potential for an accidental release.  The process equipment is evaluated against best engineering practices and adheres to codes and standards regulating the water treatment process.  Supplier manuals and maintenance instructions are used as a basis for scheduled mai"

Training on operating procedures, the safe handling of chlorine, and inspection and testing procedures are in place to reduce the potential for an accidental release.  Plant operators inspect the process on a hourly basis and monitor chlorine sensors from a remote panel.  All plant personnel are trained in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and the use of repair kits for one ton and 150 pound cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe facility emergency response plan has been approved by the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Allegheny County.  In addition to Mark Lerch, Facility Emergency Response Coordinator, Scott Olsen may be contacted at 412-243-6254.  If an emergency occurs, the Facility Emergency Response Coordinator will notify the Penn Hills Fire Department, the Penn Hills Emergency Management Services, and the Allegheny County Emergency Management Agency.  The facility has in place alarms, both visual and audio, that will notify employees within the complex of a release.\r\n\r\nSince the inception of the initial RMP, a more intensive training program has been instituted to focus more on the chlorine feed process and the controls required to improve safety for our employees and the public.  Employee initial training and retraining are being conducted as required by SARA Title III.  Maintenance procedures with documented schedules have been implemented to ensure that potential equipment failures are reduced due to improved maintenance and inspection activities."
