Since ammonia releases from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA?s Risk Management system.\n\nThe overriding purposed of the Ammonia PSM System is to prevent the unintended release of Ammonia from the refrigeration system as well as prevent fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic events.\n\nThe PSM system covers in written format the following elements:\n\n-Employee Participation\n-Process Safety Information\n-Process Technology\n-Operating Procedures\n-Non-Routine Work Practices\n-Contractor Requirements\n-Process Safety Review\n-Mechanical Integrity\n-Training Requirements\n-Management of Change\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review\n-Incident Investigation\n-Emergency Planning and Response\n-Compliance Audits\n-Security Against Theft\n\nThere have been no ammonia-related incidents at the Springdale Dairy within the last five years that have resulted in onside or offsite impacts.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nThe Engine Room technicians are in charge of administration as well as actual operation of the system and maintain PSM files that are open to all employees.\nIn addition to being run by the technicians involved in it?s operation, the other people in the plant are kept informed of PSM System status by initial training upon hire and periodic refresher training in safety meetings and plant wide events.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nWritten information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the de"

An Emergency Response Summary book has been prepared and distributed to the Springdale and Sharonville Fire Departments to help them to be prepared for an emergency response.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nFormal studies using the What-If/Checklist Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards.  This analysis has indicated shortcomings in the system which have been corrected.\n\nOperator Procedures:\nWritten, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.  These procedures are regularly audited for completeness and followed by al the operators.\n\nTraining:\nA training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained in all aspects of the system and the duties which they must perform in it?s operation.  The program includes classroom, on-the-job and performance demonstration elements.\n\nContractors:\nAll contractors working on the system are screened and evaluated by the operating technicians in charge of the PSM system before being allowed to work on the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Their work is constantly monitored by these same operators and they have complete authority to suspend work if it?s not been done properly.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review:\nA pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are operational, training has been performed and that construction has been completed to design standards.  This same review is also conducted when there is a charge in the process safety information.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nThis element of the system ensures that the Ammonia refrigeration system is built and maintained using preventive and predictive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdown or failures.\n\nHot Work Permit: \nThis element of the system ensures that a signed permit is obtained before any cutting, welding, or open "

This same system is in place throughout the facility.\n\nManagement of Change:\nThese procedures are designed to insure that all changes made to the Ammonia Refrigeration system are properly designed and reviewed before implementing and that other elements of the PSM system are updated to reflect any changes.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nThis element insures that any incidents (and `near misses?) are investigated and documented by an investigation team.  Any recommendations are resolved immediately to improve the safety of the facility and personnel.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nThere are procedures to conduct regular audits of the PSM system both by internal and external experts.  Any recommendations by these audits are resolved.\n\nSystem Security:\nA system has been implemented to prevent theft or tampering with the system, including perimeter guarding, physical and electronic locks on critical equipment and around the clock monitoring by operators and Security Personnel.\n\nAll records of the PSM system are maintained in the PSM Office located in the Engine Room of the facility, where they are open to examination at any time by concerned employees or management."
