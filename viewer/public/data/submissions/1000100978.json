The District's accidental\r\nrelease prevention strategy incorporates operator training, periodic audits, standard operating\r\nprocedures, regularly scheduled maintenance, management practices, continuous system\r\nmonitoring, and current technology to achieve its goals. Additionally, applicable provisions of\r\nFederal, State, and Local regulations are followed to ensure compliance and prevention of\r\naccidental releases.\r\nIn the unlikely event of a release, this plan addresses the response to emergencies by the District\r\nand coordination with response agencies that may be involved. In addition, the District has\r\nprepared an Emergency Response Plan to address an alarm scenario. Training includes\r\ninstruction on using emergency response equipment and following proper procedures in the\r\nevent of a chlorine release. A copy of the Emergency Response Plan is included as Appendix A.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n[Reference CalARP Regulation 19 CCR 2745.3(b)]\r\n\r\nThe Hidden Valley Lake Community Services District (District) operates a Wastewater\r\nReclamation Plant that treats domestic wastewater from the community of Hidden Valley Lake,\r\nCalifornia. The only substance used at the Wastewater Reclamation Plant (stationary source)\r\nthat is regulated by the RMP requirements is chlorine gas.\r\nAs a final step in the treatment process, chlorine gas is added to the treated wastewater as a\r\ndisinfectant. The chlorination distribution system and chlorine gas storage used for disinfection\r\nare located in the Wastewater Reclamation Plant's Control Room.

However, in practice the amount of chlorine\r\nstored on site will be less than 4,000 pounds, because the gas is continuously being used. Both\r\none-ton cylinders are connected to the chlorination system, with one of cylinders feeding\r\nchlorine to the system and the other cylinder in reserve. When the pressure in the active cylinder\r\nfalls below 20 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), an automatic switchover system places the\r\nreserve cylinder on line while allowing the first cylinder to depressurize to ambient pressure.\r\nThen the empty one-ton cylinder is replaced with a reserve cylinder delivered to the site by the\r\nchlorine vendor. Chlorine gas under pressure in the cylinder flows through the cylinder valve and directly into the\r\nchlorinator.\r\nNote: There is no pressurized piping between the cylinder valve and the chlorinator.\r\nThe chlorinator reduces the chlorine gas pressure to less than atmospheric and regulates the\r\nchlorine gas flow rate. Chlorine gas under a negative air pressure flows through piping passing\r\nthrough the automatic switchover system, a gas flow measuring device, and to the ejector where\r\nit is mixed with untreated wastewater.\r\nNote: A more detailed description of the process with diagrams is provided in the Chlorine\r\nSystem Operating Procedures included as Appendix E.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention\r\nSteps\r\n[Reference CalARP Regulation 19 CCR 2745.3(c)]\r\n\r\nThe District has in place the following general strategies to help prevent the release of chlorine\r\ngas:\r\n\u00bf Regularly scheduled maintenance of the chlorine systems;\r\n\u00bf A defined management system that defines roles and responsibilities;\r\n\u00bf Written operating and emergency procedures;\r\n\u00bf Readily available information to plant operators;\r\n\u00bf Training for gas handling and use of emergency repair kits;\r\n\u00bf Continuous system monitoring;\r\n\u00bf A proactive inciden"
