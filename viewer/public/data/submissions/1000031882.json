This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the TexPan Facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe TexPan Facility is operated by Enbridge Energy Marketing, LLC.  The facility is a loading and transfer facility for Natural Gas Liquids (condensate and LPG).   The facility  recieves, stores and loads natural gas liquids (NGLs) from trucks to railcars.  Liquids will be contained in tanker trucks and railcars while on site.  A typical railcar has a capacity of 650 barrels and a typical tanker truck can contain between 150 and 220 barrels of flammable liquid at the facility.  There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present.  The facility may have multiple railcars and tanker trucks on site and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors that support the loading operations.  The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 under the regulation.

Because the processes at the facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of TexPan Facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  TexPan Facility strongly promotes employee imvolvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, an"

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  TexPan Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  TexPan Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and/or What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  TexPan Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, eme"

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\n\n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skill and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors:  TexPan Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  TexPan Facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.
