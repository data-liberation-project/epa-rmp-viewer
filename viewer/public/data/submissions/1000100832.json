Braga Fresh Foods has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document Braga Fresh Foods policies addressing the implementation of these regulations.  The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and emergency response and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nBraga Fresh Foods Gonzales facility provides product cooling, processing and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.  This processing includes cooling, cleaning, cutting and packaging vegetables. \r\n\r\nThe facility is located in a light industrial area of Gonzales. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Refrigeration System (\"System\"). This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system with equipment located inside and outside.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT \r\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is impor"

The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\r\n \r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nBraga Fresh Foods's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.  The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Prevention Program implemented by Braga Fresh Foods is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\r\nKey objectives of Braga Fresh Foods Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\r\n2. Thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Braga Fresh Foods.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter.)\r\n3. Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.) \r\n4. Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Braga Fresh Foods certifies operators following completion of operator training and Braga Fresh Foods's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.

This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \r\nSecond, all Braga Fresh Foods employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\r\n6. Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Braga Fresh Foods's Management of Change Procedure.  \r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Braga Fresh Foods has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Braga Fresh Foods Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \r\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\r\n7. Verification of Braga Fresh Foods's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Braga Fresh Foods personnel.

Minimize employee injury and illness.  (Addressed under Braga Fresh Foods's Illness and Injury Prevention Program.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Braga Fresh Foods facility has been in operation since 2010 and has no ammonia releases incidents which should be addressed under the accident history section of this report.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nBraga Fresh Foods's Emergency Response Program is described in their Emergency Response Plan for the Gonzales facility.\r\n\r\nThis plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary.   The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators.  Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \r\nUnder Braga Fresh Foods's Emergency Response policy, Braga Fresh Foods employees who have been trained as \"First Responders\" may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment).  Braga Fresh Foods will evacuate affected area, begin notification process and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department and/or refrigeration contractor).\r\n\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some recommendation items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations"
