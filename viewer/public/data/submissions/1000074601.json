They observe safety precautions in  handling ammonia to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community, the environment, and adhere to applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends on the manner in which the facility handles ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of personnel.\n\n\n\nEmergency response for this facility is coordinated with the Valdosta Fire Department. This includes procedures for notifying the Fire Department in the event of an incident involving ammonia.\n\n\n\nb. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility consists of a cotton seed delinting plant, an oilseed processing plant, a vegetable oil refinery, a refined oils packaging and a trucking operation.\n\n\n\nc. Accident Release Prevention\n\n\n\nThe concepts used in this facility's prevention program are the elements of the Process Safety Management Program: employee participation, process saefty information, analysis of hazards, operating procedures and safe working practices, personnel training, contractor programs, pre-startup reviews, maintenance and mechanical integraty programs, hot work permit procedures, incident investigations, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits.\n\n\n\nd. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable release in the past five years.\n\n\n\ne. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with the Valdosta Fire Department, such that in the event of an incident, immediate emergency response measures can be implemented.\n\n\n\nf. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAll planned changes have been implemented."
