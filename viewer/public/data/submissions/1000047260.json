The worst-case scenario is the rupture of the largest chlorine cylinder and the loss of the entire contents over a 10-minute period. The distance to the toxic endpoint was determined using tables and equations provided by the EPA, more specifically, its software RMP*Comp. \r\n\r\nThe EPA dispersion model does allow some minor reduction due to the release being enclosed in a building. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm chlorine as well as the population impacted and sensitive public receptors is listed in the details of this submittal and per recent regulatory changes are not included in this Executive Summary.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario was developed following EPA regulations and it is not considered to be a likely release scenario for emergency planning. Historically throughout the chlorine industry, a rupture of a chlorine cylinder is very rare. Additionally, EPA mandates that assumed meteorological conditions be the most conservative. Therefore, the results of this worst-case scenario off-site consequence analysis are extremely conservative.\r\n\r\nThe only administrative control used to limit the worst case scenario is the use of"

Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at the WTP. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits. The WTP conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the Process Safety Regulations are being implemented. These audits are carried out periodically and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. The most recent audit was conducted in 2014.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation. The WTP promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. There have been no releases meeting this criteria, but if there were, these investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. A vapor release/employee exposure incident, that did not meet reporting thresholds, occurred in August 2006. It was promptly investigated and administrative controls were strengthened.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation. The WTP believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

The WTP provides potable water to the service area.  As a part of this operation, hazardous materials are used to help meet the quality demands of its customers and are committed to compliance with regulations, which protect the public health. This plan is updated and resubmitted to accommodate any plant changes in chemical delivery systems or chemical quantities or at least every five years.\r\n\r\nThis submission is a summary of the overall safety and release prevention programs in place. The prevention program includes the Cal-OSHA General Industrial Safety Orders Section 5189 requirements for a Process Safety Management (PSM) program. This program is required to be in place in order to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of Highly Hazardous Materials handled by the facility in quantities in excess of the Threshold Quantities stated in Appendix A of Section 5189.  The PSM Program meets the requirements of Section 5189 and the Federal and State regulations for a prevention program.  \r\ni-2  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\nGSWC is committed to the safe operation of its facilities to protect its workers, the public and the environment. It is the policy of GSWC that all elements of the PSM program required by the Cal-OSHA General Industrial Safety Orders Section 5189 and Federal OSHA and all elements Federal EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) contained herein shall be maintained current and shall be implemented fully for all activities concerning chlorine handling at the Coloma Treat"

In order to accomplish this goal, GSWC has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of the hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequence analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is the policy of GSWC that all affected employees shall be informed of the existence and content of the required PSM program elements, and that employees shall be actively involved in the development and updating of these required elements. Responsibility for regulatory compliance and maintenance of the management plan reside with the employees, Water Supply Superintendent and General Manager. \r\ni-3  Description Of The Plant And The Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe WTP is owned by the Golden State Water Company (GSWC) and is located at 11200 Coloma Drive in Rancho Cordova, California. GSWC is committed to providing needed services to local residents, businesses and visitors to Rancho Cordova, and to being a positive influence on the community. This includes respect for the safety of the public and Company employees, as well as concern for the environment.\r\n\r\nThe WTP began operation in the early 1970's and the current systems for handling chlorine were installed as a part of a plant improvement project that occurred in 1993. The facility is located in a commercial/residential neighborhood across the street from a fire station. \r\n\r\nChlorine is handled as a liquefied gas under pressure in steel containers. Chlorine exceeds the 2500-pound threshold amount set by the EPA RMP (40 CFR Part 68), 1500 pounds set by Cal OSHA PSM and the 100-pound limit set by the State of California CalARP threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nChlorine is received in ton containers by"

These were first presented in the 1994 Risk Management and Prevention Plan (RMPP). The American Water Works Association Research Foundation's Compliance Guide and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants (AWWA Compliance Guidance) was also used to describe emergency planning scenarios.\r\n\r\nOne scenario considered involved a gaseous release for chlorine. Because of the inherent safety provided by the integral yoke regulators, just one of the suggested release scenarios from the AWWA was submitted. The details of the scenarios, the map of the areas of concern and the sensitive receptors within the vulnerability zone around the WTP are included in the details of the report but in compliance with recent regulatory changes they are not included in this Executive Summary.\r\n\r\ni-6  General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \r\ni-6.1  Management System\r\nThe Coloma WTP has developed a management system to plan, organize, implement and control the risk management program elements. GSWC's management system was developed to maintain and continually improve the risk management program elements and plan updates. This system satisfies the management system requirement for Program 3 processes under OSHA regulations.

The hot work permit satisfies all of the requirements of Cal-OSHA Regulations. As an extra layer of protection, no hot work is performed in the Chlorine area when chlorine cylinders are present.\r\n\r\nContractors. When the WTP hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities, the WTP has a strict policy of informing all contractors and visitors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the covered process. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for an emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \r\n\r\ni-7   Five-Year Accident History\r\nThe WTP has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.

Action items resulting from the 2002 PHA update included installing an emergency shower in close proximity to personnel exit door, installation of appropriate ventilation system, installation of a windsock and container scales, and updating operating procedures.  As a result of the 2007 PHA update, operating procedures were updated to address safety procedures related to the lifting bar attachment. The 2012 PHA did not identify any areas that needed process safety improvement. \r\n\r\nThere is a commitment to continue to improve safety by reviewing, revising, and enhancing written procedures as well as implementing other action items. Written procedures were enhanced in 2004, 2008, and 2014 to include additional safety and equipment check steps and development of specific chlorine delivery procedures related to supplier communication. In addition, we have developed a mechanical integrity program which includes development of preventative maintenance procedures. In the most recent PHA there were no recommendations provided.  Additionally, none of the items in the Internal Audit are critical or essential; rather they represent enhancements or continuous improvement and additional staff has been added to ensure execution of all elements of the PSM and RMP."

Refresher training is provided on an as-needed basis and following any changes to procedures. Annually, these procedures are reviewed and revised as needed to ensure they reflect current practices and regulatory requirements. Support staff is used to facilitate submissions to agencies as required by regulations.\r\n\u00bf\tControlling - The Environmental Specialist in conjunction with designees will conduct periodic internal reviews or audits against the goals and objectives of the program elements, facilitate submissions to agencies as required by regulations and plan to meet future regulatory changes and updates.\r\n\r\ni-6.2  Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe prevention programs described in the following section represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment. Many of these prevention programs (e.g., PHAs, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls). Those recommendations that are planned for implementation are discussed in the Prevention Program. Those applicable safeguards that have already been implemented or that were part of the original design are summarized below and described in more detail in section 6. These safeguards prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nAll covered processes have control systems designed to maintain operating parameters (temperature, pressures, flow, level, etc.) within allowable limits. The covered processes are also equipped with alarms to alert personnel when the operating"

      "SummaryText": "comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP study. Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed in 2012. There was also a detailed seismic assessment conducted in 1994 as well as consideration of other external events which have been revalidated as appropriate for changing times.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures. For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the WTP maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining. The WTP has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating and maintaining the processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity. The WTP carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes: gas chlorine cylinders, piping, relief and vent systems, beacons, gas monitors, alarms, and other items essential to the containment of chlorine gas. Qualified personnel, who have received previous training in maintenance practices, carry out maintenance operations. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. The most recent field verification inspection at the plant to ensure that equipment is installed and maintained as designed was conducted on January 7 and January 8"
