The stationary source is the Houston Retail Support Center located at 4625 Windfern Road, Houston, TX.  The site is owned and operated by HE Butt Grocery Company. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. \n\nThis is a revised RMP submission for a cold storage warehouse.\n\nThe refrigeration system in this facility has an inventory of approximately 10,980 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan is being provided to the local LEPC for review.\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW \nThis food distribution facility operates a two temperature, single stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with an engine room capacity of 314.8 TR @ +19A?F medium temperature suction and 300.2 TR @ -27A?F low temperature suction. This refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an overfeed ratio of approximately 4:1 for all evaporators. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system. \n\nT"

      "SummaryText": "his system operates at two different suction temperatures both as single stage systems. The ammonia refrigeration system contains six interconnected sub-systems:\n1. Low temperature system (-27A?F @ 0.4 PSIG).\n2. Medium temperature system (+19A?F @ 32.5 PSIG).\n3. Thermosyphon pilot receiver system (95A?F @ 181.1 PSIG).\n4. Condenser system (95A?F C.T. 80A?F W.B.).\n5. Compressor low-temperature system (-29A?F @ 0.8 \" hg.).\n6. Compressor medium-temperature system (+17A?F @ 30.4 PSIG).\n\nMajor equipment located inside the engine room includes:\nA? Two low-temperature compressors ( both are FES model 400-GLE Compressor packages, each rated @ 150.1 TR/ 449.2 BHP ).\nA? One medium-temperature compressor ( FES model 290-GLE Compressor package, rated @ 314.8 TR/ 360.6 BHP). \nA? One 36\" dia. X 8'-0\" thermosyphon pilot-receiver.\nA?

One-Hansen APC Auto-Purger.\n\nMajor equipment located outside on the roof includes: \nA? One evaporative condenser (BAC CXV-610, rated @ 7,865 MBH, for +95A? FCT/ 80A? FWB).\n\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\n\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system.

      "SummaryText": "nce at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the low temperature recirculator (V-3) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling this vessel causing the released quantity to be 6,000 pounds with no piping volume included. The distance to toxic end point of 3.2 miles creates a circle of concern that includes a residential population of 104,700 people.\n\nThe alternative release scenario evaluated in this hazard assessment  is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of  15 minutes. The size of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (150 lbs/min) with a release duration of fifteen (15) minutes.\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP. Following is an overview.\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase o"
