      "SummaryText": "The purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), EPA Standard 40 CFR 68 is to prevent or minimize the result of a catastrophic release of  highly hazardous chemicals (HHC's) from a process.  Any activity or combination of activities and any system involving HHC's is considered a process if a potential for the release of the hhc\u00bfs exists.  Appendix `A\u00bf of the standard lists the chemicals and their threshold quantities which require the implementation of 40 CFR 68.  For chlorine, the threshold quantity is 2500 lbs.  Since K.T. Hutchinson WTF maintains an inventory of up to 20,000 lbs. of chlorine, the plant is required to maintain a RMP.  The RMP is required to have the following sections:\n\n1. Employee Involvement -- A written plan of action regarding employee participation is provided in this section.  Employers are expected to consult with employees on the development and implementation of the RMP; the employees are expected to participate in the hazard analysis and the employees have a right to access to the hazard analyses and to all other information required to be developed under the rule. Employees are defined as work site and contractor employees. \n\n2. Process Safety Information --This section requires documentation of the hazard information on the HHC's as well as technology and equipment information on covered processes. All employees are required to review and understand the contents of this section.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis -- The hazard analysis section describes the methodology, team membership requirements and documentation requirements of the hazard analysis to be performed on the process.\n\n4. Operation Procedures -- This section is provided to ensure that step-by-step instructions are provided for initial, normal, temporary and emergency operations involving the process or the process components.  Potential hazards, operating limits and consequences of deviation are provided to ensure that the operations are performed in such a way as to provi"

The procedures are provided at the work stations and are only conducted by or under the supervision of personnel approved by the plant manager. At no time is any operation to be performed on the system with less then two operators. Those operations regarded as the most likely to cause a release are only to be performed during normal working hours (in the event of a release this should reduce the confusion of public evacuation).\n\n5. Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance) -- Since the condition of the system components is a large factor in the potential for HHC release, the mechanical integrity of those components is considered in this section.  Procedures and documentation requirements for inspections, tests, Maintenance and Quality control are covered by this section. Maintenance is conducted  only by or under the supervision of personnel approved by the plant manager.\n\n6. Training -- The facility is required to insure that all employees are knowledgeable and are provided the right to knowledge about chlorine, the process, its operation and maintenance procedures, all potential hazards involved and the RMP.  This section is provided to meet those requirements as well as provide instruction on the documentation requirements of the standard. Training is performed both on the job and in a formal setting and is conducted (as a minimum) on an annual bassis. New employees are provided with chlorine safety training immediately, and process operations and maintenance as soon as practical. \n\n7. Contractors -- Contractors and their employees who work on or near the process are considered in this section.  The management of contracts, responsibilities of employers and training of contract personnel are described in this section.\n\n8. Emergency Planning and Response -- In the event that a release, or an injury related to the process occurs, this section provides instruction on the action that is expected to be taken immediately afterw"

Planning for site familiarization and drills are on-going.\n\n9. Incident Investigation -- This section provides instructions on the definition, investigation and documentation of incidents involving the process as required by the standard. Since the creation of this water treatment facility there have been no incidents involving this chemical.\n\n10. Pre-Startup Safety Review -- This section provides instruction on the requirements of when and how management is expected, by the standard, to ensure that the RMP is reviewed and up to date, specifically after changes to the process have been made that could reduce the effectiveness of the program.\n\n11. Management of Change -- This section describes the procedures that are to be used in the event that the RMP must be changed.  The documentation requirements are outlined in this section as well.\n\n12. Compliance Audits -- To ensure that the management and employees are following the operations, maintenance and documentation requirements of the RMP and that the RMP follows the requirements of EPA Standard 40 CFR 68, an audit is required to be performed every three years.  This section describes the procedures and documentation requirements of audits. This audit has already been performed twice since the original RMP submission. Once in-house as required by the RMP and once by an engineering firm hired by the EPA.\n\n     All engineering and administrative controls recommended as a result of the previous hazard analysis as well as any homeland security analysis results were incorporated into the design of the new chlorine system when applicable. Completion of recommendations resulting from the current hazard analysis was 06/29/2007."
