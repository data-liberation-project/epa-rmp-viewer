Five Year Accident History\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC has had one release of ammonia from the Denison, Iowa facility that resulted in an OSHA recordable injury.  The incident occurred on June 20, 1995 and the release did not affect the public or the environment.  Due to overpressure, a pressure relief valve on an ammonia compressor opened releasing ammonia vapors to the atmosphere.\nFollowing the incident, TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC installed or modified process control devices and lowered the operating pressure.  TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC has not had an OSHA recordable incident related to the ammonia system since the system revisions were completed.\n\n5.
