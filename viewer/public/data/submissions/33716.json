      "SummaryText": "The Maumee River Wastewater Treatment Plant was built in 1970 to serve the cities of Maumee,\nSylvania, the Villages of Waterville and Whitehouse and othe portions of western Lucas County in\nOhio.  It eliminated thousands of septic tanks and numerous small treatment plants that were polluting\nthe area rivers and streams.\n\nThe population served by the Maumee River WWTP has grown so the the plant is now in the process of\nits third expansion.  This expansion will end the use of chlorine for disinfection, it will be replaced by\nultraviolet disinfection.  Until that time (12/04) the plant has a trained emergency repsonse team and a\nchlorne scrubber capable of neutraling 3000 pounds of chlorine.\n\nIt is important to note that although this plan asks for a five year accident history, the Maumee River WWTP\nhas not a chlorine emergency since it was built.  Design and construction standards plus safety training\nhave made the use of chlorine safe in the water and wastewater industry"
