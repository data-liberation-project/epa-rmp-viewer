The process involves the manufacture of vinyl acetate-ethylene (VAE) copolymer emulsions.\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe plant maintains vinyl acetate monomer and ethylene inventories which exceed the RMP threshold quantity for toxic liquids and flammable gases respectively.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations as well as our own environmental, health, and safety standards.  Air Products Polymers, LP manages the safety of our facilities by designing for safe operation, operating the plant safely, maintaining the plant, and by auditing our operations. \n\nOur accident prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the request of local fire support through the South Brunswick Township Industrial Mutual Aid Council (SBIMAC), the LEPC, and the South Brunswick Office of Emergency Management so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders if necessary.\n\nAir Products Polymers, LP is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  Air Products Polymers, LP is a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and subscribes to the Responsible Care Program.  The Dayton, NJ facility is actively involved with local organizations concerned with the safety of our community and the environment such as SBIMAC and the South Brunswick Township Community Advisory Panel.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68) and New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJAC 7:31).

The facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe facility is located on Corn Road in Middlesex County.  To produce water-based VAE copolymer emulsions, vinyl acetate liquid and ethylene vapor are first emulsified in water and then polymerized in reactors.  The products, non-hazardous liquids, are shipped by railcar, bulk trucks, or packages to industrial customers for applications such as latex paints, non-woven binders, adhesives, and building products.  Vinyl acetate monomer is present on site in a 110,000 gallon storage tank, railcars, piping and the processing unit to maintain continuous and efficient production.  Each vinyl acetate railcar holds approximately 195,000 pounds.  Ethylene is present onsite in a 52,500 gallon cryogenic liquid storage tank, a vapor storage tank, railcars, piping, occasionally a tank truck and the processing unit to maintain continuous and efficient production.\n\n\n3. The worst case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for an RMP listed toxic liquid at the Dayton, NJ facility, as defined by the EPA, involves the release of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) from the failure of a railcar containing vinyl acetate monomer.  A VAM railcar, which has a theoretical capacity of 195,000 pounds, is the vessel that contains the largest quantity of VAM at our facility in the absence of passive mitigation.  The EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide was used to determine that this release would result in offsite impact.  The worst case release scenario is highly unlikely due to several factors which include a railcar inspection program to maintain integrity, operator visual monitoring to watch for leaks or spills, and lower explosive level (LEL) monitors to detect spills.\n\nThe WCS for a RMP listed flammable chemical at the Dayton, NJ facility, as defined by the EPA, is a catastrophic failure of one of the li"

The maximum distance to the EPA-defined end point (1 psi overpressure) for this event would result in offsite impact.  Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternate release scenario (ARS) for VAM at our facility is the failure of a fitting on one of our polymerization reactors during pressurization and the subsequent release of VAM.  The EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide was used to determine that this type of incident would result in offsite impact if no active or passive mitigation was used.  Even though the EPA allows credit for active mitigation methods, no such credit was taken in order to determine a potential offsite impact.  The polymerization reactors are equipped with safety systems including LEL detection monitors and automated emergency ventilation.\n\nThe ARS for ethylene at our facility is the failure of an unloading hose during the transfer of ethylene from a railcar  to storage.  The EPA Offsite Analysis Guide was used to determine that this type of incident would result in offsite impact if no active or passive mitigation was used.  Even though the EPA allows credit for active mitigation methods, no such credit was taken in order to determine potential offsite impact.  The railcar unloading process is monitored by trained operating personnel.  Remote shut off switches are readily accessible to close the unloading valve line from the railcar.  The ethylene unloading area is equipped with LEL detection monitors to detect the presence of flammable gases.\n\n\n4.

Safety reviews are conducted for all new installations and modifications to existing processes.  \n\nOur plant is operated safely by trained and certified operators who follow standard operating procedures with defined safe operating limits.

We hold contractors to the same high safety training standards as our employees.  We implement task observation and accident prevention techniques.\n\nWe routinely audit our operations for compliance with federal, state, and local regulation.  We also have a program to audit the plant's performance against corporate environmental and safety standards.  \n\n5. Five year accident history:\n\nThere has been one incident involving vinyl acetate and ethylene, which required reporting to the NRC, state and local emergency responders.  A leak occurred on one of the reactor manway gaskets. Plant alarms and mitigation systems activated and the incident was brought under control without harm to any population or to the environment.

An OPHR was completed in 1998.  Process improvements are being implemented as a result of the OPHR and our ongoing process safety evaluations."
