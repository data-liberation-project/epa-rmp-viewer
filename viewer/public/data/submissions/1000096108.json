This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes. \n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\n   There were no RMP incidents in the past 5 years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program:\n\n     The facility's emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER standard. At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies. All employees have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level. The plant also has a Emergency Services Team, who are trained to the HAZMAT Technician or HAZMAT Specialist levels of the OSHA's HAZWOPER standard and OSHA Fire Brigade - NFPA 600 Advanced Exterior Fire Fighting. All employees receive annual refresher training in the emergency plan. Emergency response activities have been coordinated with the Santa Rosa County Emergency Management Agency and the Pace Fire Department. Periodic drills are conducted with these agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency plans. Periodic planning and communications meetings are held with the Pace Fire Department, Santa Rosa County Emergency Management and the LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n     Plant hazards reviews, risk analyses or incident reviews are among the systems we rely on to drive safety improvements. At this time there are no major administrative, operational, process or equipment changes planned for the facility."

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMethylamines, derived from methanol and ammonia, and various amines, derived from higher alcohols and ammonia, are produced at the Taminco site.  In addition, DIMLA is produced from dimethylamine and formaldehyde 37% solution.  Some of the compounds handled are considered hazardous by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  We insist on strict adherence to safety precautions developed to prevent human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal safety and health, as well as the safety and health of our coworkers and minimize the threat to our community and the environment.  Our safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the proper maintenance of the safety systems designed in these facilities, the procedures used by our personnel and the training of these personnel.  \n\nAs a American Chemistry Council Member, our safety programs are in compliance with Responsible Care.  Our emergency response plan, which is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER and Fire Brigade regulations, contains procedures for notification of the local Emergency Management Authority, local fire department, and potentially affected neighbors.  Neighbor notification is by a network of sirens surrounding the plant site, which can be activated by either Plant personnel or the local Fire Department.\n\n    This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n    The primary purpose of this facility is to convert ammonia and alcohols into a variety of chemical intermediates including methylamines and higher amines.
