USA (Cutrale) Leesburg facility (the Facility) is located at 11 Cloud Street, Leesburg, Lake County, Florida 34748 (see Figure 1-1).  The Facility is a critical part of Cutrale's Florida citrus processing operations.  The Facility's main functions include extracting and blending juice and essences from oranges, grapefruits, lemons,limes etc.  \n\nCutrale is committed to operating this and other Cutrale facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of Cutrale and Contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  In addition, Cutrale is committed to operating this and other Cutrale facilities in full compliance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the Facility is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable OSHA and EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, Cutrale has developed this integrated Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan (the Plan).  Among the important components of this Plan are Cutrale's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the Facility, and Cutrale's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Facility.  Cutrale has designated its corporate Environmental Affairs Manager and the Facility's Plant Manager as the individuals with primary responsibility and accountability for seeing that this Plan and its associated components accurately reflect Facility conditions and that it is fully implemented. \n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Facility is designed to extract juices and essences from locally grown citrus fruits.  These products are either sold to offsite packagers for sale to the public or blended onsite or sold directly to a reseller.  To support these primary functions, the Facility operates four ammonia refrigerat"

      "SummaryText": "ion systems.  \n \nThe refrigeration systems are relatively simple systems typical of those that are common throughout the food processing industry.  The basic technology involves the re-circulation of ammonia, with a change in state from liquid to a liquid/gas mixture, then back to a liquid.  \n\nAmmonia is delivered to the Facility in its liquid state and is stored in a high-pressure receiver.  From the high pressure receiver, the liquid ammonia is moved by pressure to a re-circulator or accumulator (different terminology indicating the same vessel, depending on the age of the vessel).  Liquid is pumped from the re-circulator or moved by pressure from the accumulator to the individual pieces of cooling equipment, which include chillers and air handlers serving production rooms, coolers, product storage tanks, and the like.  As the liquid pulls heat from the surroundings it begins to evaporate.  Since evaporation (as well as condensation) occurs at constant temperature, the result is a warm, low-pressure vapor where the liquid ammonia absorbs heat and changes to a vapor or liquid vapor mix.  The warmed, lower pressure, vapor or liquid vapor mix returns to the re-circulator or accumulator where liquid and vapor is separated and just vapor is then pulled to a bank of compressors.  The compressor compresses the low pressure vapor to a high pressure vapor and is routed to the condensers, which condense the ammonia to a high pressure liquid.  This flow is then returned to the high-pressure receiver previously described.    \n\nTo determine the maximum intended ammonia inventory, a complex calculation must be performed to account for the quantity of ammonia in each of the major process vessels operating at their normal levels.  \n\n1.3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has an aggressive accidental release prevention program that is based upon a foundation of employee awareness and proactive system maintenance.  This program is documented in this integrated Plan"

      "SummaryText": ".  This program meets or exceeds all requirements of applicable PSM/RMP regulations.\n\n\n1.4 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn spite of the Facility's aggressive release prevention program, the Facility experienced one accident in its Five Year Accident History.\n\nOn December 2, 2010 a refrigeration contractor was performing demo-work on pipe that was pumped out prior to the demo but had some residual ammonia remaining in the pipe end cap.  As he was cutting the bolts on a flange, a small amount of liquid ammonia sprayed on the contractor.  The contractor was immediately flushed with water from a nearby water hose.  The estimated release was four pounds which was calculated from the contents in the pipe from the pipe cap to the flange. The contract employee was sent to the hospital for treatment and returned to work on December 8, 2010.\n\n1.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n  \nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Plan that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by Facility employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  This ERP has been communicated to the City of Leesburg Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\nIt is Cutrale's policy with regard to emergency response that its personnel are trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician Level.  These are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a hazardous substance release and who have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities of the release.  These individuals also are trained to respond to a release by stopping the release, thereby assuming a more aggressive role than those trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  The ERP describes the conditions under which Cutrale personnel would attempt to stop a chemical release, as well as the sequence of actions that would be undertaken under those circumstances.  \n\nIt is Cutrale's policy for employees to call the Facility's 24-hour guard in the event of any "

The local Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response Team has the responsibility to oversee mitigation of the release conditions.  The Leesburg Fire Department, in conjunction with Cutrale, is presently responsible for determining when evacuation of offsite areas is necessary, and for public notification.\n\n1.6 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nUpgrade of the Fruit processing refirgeration system from an all ammonia system to an ammonia/glycol system. Ammonia will be used to cool the glycol and the glycol will be pumped the fruit processing loads. This project is complete. The safety advantage is the ammonia charge is reduced by 60% and will be contained in satellite packaged units.\n\nThis Plan incorporates a number of modifications to Facility procedures designed to improve employee safety awareness, enhance safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia systems, reduce the potential for accidental releases to occur, and increase the speed and effectiveness of the Facility's response should a release occur."
