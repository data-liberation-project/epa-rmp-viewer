      "SummaryText": "Beck Aluminum Racine produces a wide range of specification aluminum alloys which are used in die-casting, permanent molding and sand-cast industries.  The manufacturing plant is located on 7.5 acres.  The multi-furnace operation converts aluminum scrap into customer specification molten metal, which is then poured into a 30-pound alloyed ingot.  Molten metal pumps are used to circulate and stir the metal within the furnaces.  When the magnesium content needs to be lowered, chlorine gas is introduced into the molten metal to form magnesium chloride that is skimmed from the molten metal.  The maximum chlorine addition rate is in accordance with the facility's air permits and the MACT stack testing parameters.\n\n\n\nBeck Aluminum Racine complies with the health and safety requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management rules for the use of chlorine at the facility.  The facility has management and operational procedures for the safe storage and use of chlorine in the manufacturing process.  The facility has designated a group of employees as the chlorine handling team, which is trained in the proper handling of chlorine. \n\n\n\nBeck Aluminum Racine has had one accidental release of chlorine gas in the past five years.  In September 2013, sixty-three pounds of chlorine gas was released during a valve replacement procedure.  There were no off-site injuries and no evacuations of neighboring properties were necessary.  Plant officials have improved training for employees and have made improvements to chlorine storage areas to prevent similar accidental releases.  The chlorine cylinders received from the supplier are used and stored in an enclosed area.  Management procedures allow a maximum of two 2,000-pound cylinders to be hooked up for use at one time and a maximum of ten chlorine cylinders that may be on-site at any one time.\n\n\n\nBeck Aluminum Racine is a member of the Racine County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The committee is responsible for the development and "

      "SummaryText": "updates of the emergency response plan.  Beck Aluminum Racine coordinates with the South Shore (Mount Pleasant) Fire Department and Mount Pleasant police department, who are primary emergency responders for emergencies at the facility. \n\n\n\nBeck Aluminum Racine has implemented general accidental release measures for the use of the chlorine cylinders and chlorine gas at the facility.  The chlorine is only used and stored within the building enclosure, which provides passive mitigation for any release.  Only personnel that have received the appropriate OSHA training may respond to minor leaks in the chlorine system.  The facility's chlorine handling team is capable of responding to small leaks.  In the event of a major chlorine leak, the facility will be evacuated and the emergency responders called to coordinate the response activities. \n\n\n\nDuring an emergency response, the on-scene commander will make the determination if the public will be instructed to shelter in place or evacuate.  The lead-time for a hazmat incident could be from 0-30 minutes.  This short time may not allow for a safe evacuation, especially when extremely toxic chemical fumes are involved.  An evacuation under these considerations may expose the population to dangerous toxic chemicals and the decision may be made to shelter in place.  Preferred areas for protective sheltering would be interior hallways, rooms without windows or exterior doors, enclosed stairways and rooms on the side of the building away from where the hazard is approaching.  Doors, windows, and other potential air leaks should be sealed up to prevent toxic fumes from entering.\n\n\n\nIf evacuation is deemed appropriate, then experience indicates that shelter space would need to be provided for only 30% of the population within the initial isolation and evacuation zones.  The remaining 70% would seek shelter with family and friends outside of the risk zone.  Shelter information is found in the Human Services Shelter Plan."
