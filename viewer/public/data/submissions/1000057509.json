Chlorine is the only regulated substance located at the stationary source.  The inventory of chlorine at these sites consists of four, one-ton containers in use and a maximum of four one-ton containers in storage.\n\nThe District utilizes a vacuum operated chlorination system at its facility that significantly reduces the potential for accidental chlorine leaks during equipment operation.  District policies also require two-man crews to assist with chlorine cylinder and container delivery and off loading.  At the Bradford Pumping Plant, the chlorine cylinders are enclosed in a concrete/masonry building equipped with a chlorine gas detector, emergency ventilation system and alarms.  The emergency response policy for the stationary source includes off site evacuation and notification of emergency response agencies.\n\nThe District utilizes vacuum-operated chlorination systems at all chlorination facilities to minimize the risk of accidental releases.  The District also utilizes daily inspections, annual maintenance and repairs as necessary to ensure properly operating equipment and subsequently safe conditions.\n\nThe District has not experienced any reportable minor release of chlorine within the past five years.\n\nThe District's Emergency Response Program consists of assessment, evacuation, notification and reporting procedures.  The District's emergency procedures and policies required that chlorine leaks be reported to and addressed by the City of Visalia's Hazardous Material Response Team.\n\nThe District does not make emergency repairs to address chlorine leaks.  The District facilitates evacuation and site control until the arrival of emergency response agencies.  At this time, there are no planned changes to its safety procedures.
