      "SummaryText": "\nDynegy Midwest Generation, Inc\nBaldwin Energy Complex\nBaldwin, Illinois\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nThe following executive summary addresses Baldwin Energy Complex's (E.C.'s) compliance with Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act administered by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nBaldwin E.C., located 1 mile north of the town of Baldwin, Illinois (approximately 35 miles southeast of the St. Louis Metro area), is the largest provider of electricity in the Dynegy Midwest Generation system.  Baldwin E.C. consists of three major fossil fuel-fired units; two Babcock & Wilcox cyclone-fired once-through boilers supplying steam to their respective Westinghouse turbo-generators and one Combustion Engineering forced circulation drum boiler supplying steam to a General Electric turbine-generator.  Unit 1 went into commercial service on July 12, 1970; Unit 2 on May 21, 1973; and Unit 3 on June 20, 1975.  Together these units can produce approximately 1,778 net megawatts.\n\nThe electric output of each generator is directed to an associated main transformer, which steps up the voltage to 345,000 volts for long-range transmission.  The electricity flows to the switchyard where it is then routed to one of four 345 kV transmission lines or to a step down transformer that provides 138 kV power for transmission lines to relatively nearby substations.\n\nCooling water for the main and auxiliary condensers of the three units is provided by a 2,000-acre, man-made, cooling pond.  Baldwin Lake is approximately 1.5 miles wide and 2.5 miles long and normally holds about seven billion gallons of water.  Three pumps on the Kaskaskia River can pump makeup water into the lake each day.  The circulating water system provides over one million gallons of water each minute to the plant's main and auxiliary "

Chlorine is listed by the RMP rule and is stored in amounts greater than the threshold quantity at Baldwin E.C.\n\nBaldwin E.C. also has an ammonia supply terminal with amounts of ammonia greater than the RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia is used in the selective catalytic reduction units, which work much like a catalytic converter on a car.  Flue gas containing nitrogen oxide emissions from the combustion process is mixed with ammonia.  The mixed gases travel through a series of catalytic layers, which cause the nitrogen oxide to react with the ammonia.  The reaction converts the nitrogen oxide to pure nitrogen, a benign chemical that makes up 80 percent of the air we breathe, and water vapor.  Both elements are returned to the environment through the plant stacks. \n\nThis RMP addresses the Offsite Consequence Analysis, Prevention Program and Emergency Response Programs for Dynegy's Baldwin E.C.\n\nBaldwin E.C. employs 171 persons.  A number of contractors or vendors are also on site at any given time.  Most of these employees live nearby in Randolph County.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAs an RMP Program Level 3 facility, Baldwin E.C. is in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program requirements.  These requirements include conducting regular Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) to identify and understand hazards; preparing, following, and auditing Operating Procedures, conducting initial and refresher Training of employees, performing regular Mechanical Integrity reviews of process equipment, developing and implementing written Management of Change procedures, and conducting Pre-Startup reviews, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigations.  These requirements form the framework of our accident prevention program, and i"

      "SummaryText": "t is the policy of Dynegy to meet or exceed these requirements.\n\nBaldwin E.C. has a written Emergency Response Program that addresses the manpower and equipment necessary to handle onsite emergencies.  In complying with this RMP regulation our Emergency Response Plan has been updated to include offsite notification procedures, if necessary.  Dynegy is a participant in the Randolph County LEPC.  It is the policy of Dynegy's Baldwin E.C. to handle any onsite emergencies with our own manpower and equipment.  We would rely on outside emergency response assistance for any offsite emergencies.  No incident with offsite impacts has occurred since power generation began in 1970.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nIn accordance with the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Requirements prepared by the EPA, Baldwin E.C. has evaluated both a worst-case scenario and alternative release scenarios for chlorine and ammonia.  The worst-case scenario is defined by EPA as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to the applicable toxic endpoint.  In our situation this is a release of 390,000 pounds of ammonia in a 10-minute period.  We consider this scenario to be practically impossible.  Based on EPA's OCA model (RMP*Comp Version 1.06) this scenario would impact the surrounding community. \n\nOur alternative release scenarios (ARSs) are the result of evaluating a variety of failures of the chlorine and ammonia systems that we consider possible, although very unlikely.  For chlorine, the scenario resulting in the greatest offsite distance involves complete rupture of a 1\" valve or pipe within the chlorine system.  For ammonia, the scenario we chose involves a complete rupture of a hose during unloading.  Although unlikely, these scenarios were communicated with local emergency responders so that they are prepared to respond to these types of releases.\n\nAdministrative controls and mitigation measur"

      "SummaryText": "es designed to minimize release distances include 24-hour manning of the facility with regular inspections of the chlorine and ammonia systems, ammonia alarms for immediate notification to the control room, and HAZWOPER-trained employees prepared to immediately respond.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nBaldwin E.C. has up to 16 one-ton containers of chlorine on site at any one time.  We empty approximately two containers per week.  These containers must comply with The Chlorine Institute's specifications 106A500, 106A500X, ICC 27, and B.E. 27.  They are equipped with safety devices and are pressure tested at regular intervals as required by applicable regulations.  All containers used in the transportation of chlorine are controlled by federal or other governmental regulations.  \n\nChlorine is found in both a liquid and gas state in the one-ton containers.  Neither the gas nor the liquid is explosive or flammable, but both will react chemically with a number of other substances.  The gas has a characteristic odor and greenish yellow color and is about 2.5 times as heavy as air.  Thus, if it escapes from a container or system, it will seek the lowest level in the building or area in which the leak occurs.  Liquid chlorine is clear, amber in color, and is about 1.5 times as heavy as water.  Chlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant.  In sufficient concentration the gas irritates the mucous membranes, the respiratory system, and the skin.  In extreme cases, the difficulty of breathing may increase to the point where death can occur from suffocation.  Liquid chlorine in contact with skin or eyes will cause burns.  The characteristic, penetrating odor of chlorine gas gives warning of its presence in the air.  Its greenish-yellow color makes it visible when high concentrations are present.\n\nBaldwin E.C. has two ammonia storage tanks that can each hold about 77,000 gallons of ammonia (85% of rated capacity).  These tanks are des"

The tanks are inspected on a regular basis to ensure they are in good condition.\n\nAmmonia gas is primarily a respiratory irritant and has a characteristic odor that is easy to detect at very low concentrations.  In sufficient concentration the gas irritates the mucous membranes, the respiratory system, and the skin.  In extreme cases, the difficulty of breathing may increase to the point where death can occur from suffocation.  Liquid ammonia in contact with skin or eyes will cause burns.  Ammonia gas is flammable in a specific range of concentration of ammonia in air and can cause an explosion if ignited.  Therefore, ignition sources are controlled in areas around the ammonia supply equipment.\n\nOur employees are trained annually in safe techniques for responding to chemical releases and will immediately investigate possible leaks.  Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and equipment repair kits are maintained on site for their use.  As soon as a leak is detected, it will be isolated and appropriate repairs performed.  In more than 29 years of operation, no leak has occurred that resulted in any offsite impacts.  This is a direct result of the accident prevention procedures in place at the facility.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no RMP-defined accidents at Baldwin E.C. in the last 5 years.  Occasionally, there have been OSHA recordable incidents; however, none of these involved the chlorine or ammonia systems.  There has never been an offsite impact caused by an accident at the facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nBaldwin E.C. has a written Emergency Response Program.  This program addresses hazardous waste operations and emergency response procedures at the plant, responsibilities of employees during an emergency, reports required for an emergency, emergency recognition and prevention, safe distance requirements, evacuation plans, security and s"

Volunteer Fire Departments are available in the towns of Baldwin, Sparta, and Red Bud.  Baldwin E.C. also actively coordinates with the Randolph County LEPC, known as the Randolph County Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA) headed by Nancy J. Schilling.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAs a result of evaluating our alternative release scenarios, Baldwin E.C. will implement the following safety measures:  \n\n1. Coordination with the Randolph County Emergency Services and Disaster Agency will continue to help ensure that warnings and precautionary instructions are provided to emergency responders so that potential public receptors can be alerted.\n \n2. Since a portion of Baldwin Lake is within the alternative release scenario affected area, warning signs will be posted at each boat launch to the lake to warn boaters to maintain a safe distance from the facility.  Due to the small area of the lake within this area, this is not judged to adversely impact use of the lake.\n \nThis Risk Management Plan is presented as an example and testament of Dynegy Midwest Generation's commitment to accident prevention.  This commitment is supported by the fact that no accidents with offsite consequences have occurred at this facility.  We will continue to strive for perfection in our accident prevention program and will continue to improve our emergency response program and safety programs."
