It includes actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies.  All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant is located near Paradis, Louisiana at 15849 Old Spanish Trail (LA HWY. 631).  The processes operated at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant include:  a natural gas liquid fractionating process; and product storage and shipping.  Product shipping is either by truck, rail or pipeline.  Operations at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant consist of the following: (1) Natural Gas Liquids from off site sources are fractionated into individual hydrocarbon products (ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane, and pentane pluses).  (2) The individual hydrocarbon products, with the exception of ethane, are temporarily stored on-site in pressurized vessels prior to shipping.  (3) Ethane is delivered directly into a pipeline.  Other individual hydrocarbon products can be transferred to trucks for shipping at a truck rack, transferred to railcar for shipping at a rail rack, or delivered into pipelines.\n\nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant routinely handles quantities of natural gas, ethane, propane, normal butane and iso-butane, all of which are regulated substances and above the threshold limits listed in EPA?s Risk Management Program rule.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nTh"
