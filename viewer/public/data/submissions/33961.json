It includes actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies.  All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant is located near Paradis, Louisiana at 15849 Old Spanish Trail (LA HWY. 631).  The processes operated at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant include:  a natural gas liquid fractionating process; and product storage and shipping.  Product shipping is either by truck, rail or pipeline.  Operations at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant consist of the following: (1) Natural Gas Liquids from off site sources are fractionated into individual hydrocarbon products (ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane, and pentane pluses).  (2) The individual hydrocarbon products, with the exception of ethane, are temporarily stored on-site in pressurized vessels prior to shipping.  (3) Ethane is delivered directly into a pipeline.  Other individual hydrocarbon products can be transferred to trucks for shipping at a truck rack, transferred to railcar for shipping at a rail rack, or delivered into pipelines.\n\nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant routinely handles quantities of natural gas, ethane, propane, normal butane and iso-butane, all of which are regulated substances and above the threshold limits listed in EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program rule.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nTh"

Key elements of these programs include:\n\nEmployee Participation:  Participation in the development of the Paradis Gas Processing Plant\u00bfs process safety and risk management compliance is outlined in the Employee Participation Plan.  Employees and affected contractors have access to information developed as part of the facility\u00bfs PSM and accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): a systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nOperating Procedures: Paradis Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown and (7) start-up after turnaround.\n\nContractors: Paradis Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR\u00bfs): The Paradis Gas Processing Plant uses PSSR\u00bfs as a part of the construction pr"
