      "SummaryText": "e safety of our employees and surrounding community, the company has developed a hypothetical worst case scenario.  This model involves the release of 18,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period from a vessel leak (Liquid Spill and Vaporization) inside the facility.  Using a variety of factors such as extreme and unlikely weather conditions and mitigated release, ammonia would travel a theoretical distance before dispersing.  Based upon the model, that distance could be up to 2.2 miles.  However, industry experts consider the above scenario to be unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n-Pressure safety valves limit operating pressures in these vessels \n-Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of this vessel\n-A comprehensive preventive maintenance program is in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessel\n-Emergency response procedures would enable highly-trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any on-site or off-site situation.\n\nThe hypothetical alternative release scenario for this facility is described as pipe leak located in the compressor room of the facility.  This model is based upon the release of 620 lbs of ammonia (anhydrous) over a 10 minute period.  Using a variety of factors, such as extreme and unlikely weather conditions, ammonia would travel theoretical distance before dispersing.  Based upon the model, that distance could be up to .19 miles.  However, industry experts consider this hypothetical scenario to be unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n-The weather conditions which were used for this scenario are unlikely to occur.\n-Pressure safety valves limit operating pressures. \n-Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of piping.\n-Preventative maintenace program in place to maintain the on going integrity.\n-Emergency stop buttons located in areas outside of potential  exposure areas.\n\nContinual Safety Updates\n\nThe faciltiy strives for continual safety improvement.

As our most valuable resource, we place top priority in informing, educating, protecting, and preserving our employees as valuable members of the company.\n\nAmerican Foods Group's primary focus is to prevent the occurance of unforeseen industrial incidents/accidents from occuring in the work environment.\n\nFacility Descriptions and Regulated Substance\n\nThe operations at the facility consists of the processing of beef and specialty meat cuts.  The facility employs approximately 100 employees.   The refrigeration system at the facility comprises our Process, with the regulated substance being Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3).  This is a self contained system which provides the refrigeration for the East River facility.\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System Description\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a single stage, closed-loop system this is used to provide cooling for:  process room, temperature control, water chilling and temper water for sanitation.  A minimal amount of freezer storage is maintained at this facility.  \n\n5-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no Anhydrous Ammonia-related incidents identified for the facility in the previous five years which resulted in significant on-site or off-site consequences (New Facility).\n\nTo accomplish the facility's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a multi-faceted Safety Program.  The objectuives of the Safety Program are to achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance.\n\nThe facility has implemented a prevention program for the accidental release of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process Elements of the program coincide with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (Safety Process Management of Highly Hazardous Chemical, 29 CFR 1910.119); Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management P"

The purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent occurances, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fire, explosion, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\nComponents of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility's Accidental Release Prevention Program consists of the following elements:\n\n-Employee Participation                               -Training\n-Process Safety Information                       -Contractors\n-Process Hazard Analysis                          -Pre-Startup Review\n-Operating Procedures                                -Mechanical Integrity\n-Hot Work Program                                      -Incident Investigation\n-Management of Change                             -Compliance Audits\n-Preventative Maintenance                          \n\nEmergency Response Program has been implemented at the facility.
