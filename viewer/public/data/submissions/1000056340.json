Additionally, specific training is required in all aspects of the operation of the chlorine process for those who operate the process. Training in maintenance and repair of the chlorine process equipment is conducted with all employees who are required to maintain and repair any part of the system.\n\nDecatur Utilities has developed a chlorine Emergency Response Program to fulfill the requirements of OSHA Part 1910.38. The Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the local and state emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nSection B:  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Decatur Water Treatment Plant has one stationary source capable of holding 24 one ton containers of chlorine as well as one stationary source capable of holding 12 one ton containers of chlorine. The covered processes consist of piping (per the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 6, Piping Systems for Dry Chlorine.) and chlorine injection equipment specifically designed for each process.\n\n\n\nSection C: Worst Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\n\n\n\nDecatur Utilities has used release scenarios for both Worst Case and Alternative Case releases that are most likely to occur at the Decatur Water Treatment Plant given the pre-chlorination and post-chlorination processes.  Additionally, the rate of release and endpoints corresponding to the scenarios were derived from the EPA Supplemental Risk Management Program for Wastewater Treatment Plants, and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance For Offsite Consequence Analysis. \n\n\n\nSection D:  Prevention Program Elements\n\nManagement System\n\nDecatur Utilities has documented a management system and has assigned overa"

The management system clearly delineates accountability and responsibility of specific elements of the program to the appropriate Risk Management Plan Team Member.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nCurrent process safety information is available to all operators of the covered processes and maintenance employees in accordance with CFR 40 Part 68.48. Safety information includes current MSDS sheets, maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flows, process equipment and material specifications, safe operating procedures and codes and standards used in the design and construction of the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis     \n\nA Hazard Analysis has been performed for the Program II covered processes. A Hazard Review checklist was developed to address potential hazards associated with the Program II covered processes and regulated substance.  Causes of potential accidental release scenarios were investigated and safeguards put in place to prevent a release.  The process hazard analysis was documented and is updated every five-years.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures  \n\nProcess operating procedures were reviewed, documented, and refresher training conducted with all plant operators and maintenance employees.  Operating procedures cover all phases of process operations including system startup, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup following an emergency shutdown. Process limits were reviewed and documented. \n\n\n\nTraining \n\nChlorine safety training is performed at least once every 3 years. CPR training is mandatory for all plant employees and is conducted every two years. First aid training is also mandatory for all plant employees and is conducted at least once every 3 years. Other mandatory training is conducted at least once every 3 years for all operators and maintenance employees and includes emergen"

Documentation of employee attendance at all training sessions is maintained for a period of not less than 5 years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity   \n\nAll process equipment, piping, ventilation system, monorail and hoist, have a documented schedule of inspection, and preventive and periodic maintenance.  All maintenance inspection and testing on chlorine process equipment is conducted as per manufacturer's recommendations and is consistent with accepted engineering practices. Any deficiencies identified during such maintenance and inspections are addressed in a safe and prompt manner. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every 3 years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process. A report of the audit findings is generated following the audit and all deficiencies or recommendations are promptly addressed and the resolution is documented.  The two most recent audits are maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSpecific incident investigation reporting and documentation procedures have been implemented and are followed in response to any incident involving a covered process that did or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine. The incident investigation is conducted as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours following the incident. Following the investigation a summary report is generated and includes, at a minimum, the following information: date of incident, date the investigation began, description of the incident and any contributing factors, and any corrective action or recommendations resulting from the investigation.      \n\n\n\n\n\nSection E:  Five-year Accident History\n\nAn a"
