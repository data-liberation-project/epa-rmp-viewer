We use a combination of safety programs, accidental release prevention programs, and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n? A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\n? A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases;\n? An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n? A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule; and\n? An overview of our emergency response program.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nOur facility uses Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Ethylene Oxide (EO) in the production of Sodium Hydrosulfite and Sodium Bisulfite for use in the clay, textile, and pulp and paper industries.  The EPA has identified sulfur dioxide and ethylene oxide as having the potential to cause adverse offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of sulfur dioxide and ethylene oxide.  We are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nChemical Release Prevention Program:\n\nAt the Chemtrade Logistics Leeds Plant we take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the k"

Mechanical integrity;\n? Management of change;\n? Pre-startup review;\n? Compliance audits;\n? Incident investigation;\n? Employee participation;\n? Hot work permit; and\n? Contractor safety.\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n? SO2 and EO transfer hose inspection and replacement program;\n? EO monitoring systems that activate alarms in the event of an EO release;\n? Video monitoring systems that allow us to monitor the SO2 unloading process area; and\n? SO2 and EO storage tanks inspection, certification, and maintenance program.\n\nTogether, these individual elements of our prevention program work to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to maintaining these management systems and recognize that this is the way we do business.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no RMP-level releases of sulfur dioxide or ethylene oxide in the past five years at our facility.  We have a system in place to investigate and keep records of significant incidents, including accidental chemical releases that might occur at our facility.  If a significant release should occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\n\nEmergency Response Planning:\n\nWe maintain emergency response plans, which address all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Our plan also includes specific procedures for responding to a release of sulfur dioxide or"

Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Chester County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nRecent and Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe following is a list of improvements we have made or are considering to help prevent accidental chemical releases and their affect on our employees, community, and the environment:\n\n? SO2 and EO monitoring systems at the unloading area, warehouse, process building and storage tanks;\n? Surveillance cameras at the SO2 unloading area;\n? An enclosed SO2 level measuring system that is less vulnerable to leakage;\n? Remote SO2 and EO unloading shut-off valves;\n? SO2 rail cars with excess flow vales;\n? An SO2 release scenario drill with the Leeds Plant emergency response team, the LEPC, SERC, and other local emergency responders;\n? A community alert network; \n? Replacing \"bost\" type flanges with ANSI type flanges on the SO2 tanks;\n. Installation of \"SMART\" hoses at the SO2 unloading stations to mitgate release in the event of hose failure;\n. EO monitoring systems at the unloading area\n\nIn summary, Chemtrade is a Responsible Care company committed to the safe operation of our facility, and we will take the actions necessary to ensure the safety of our employees, members of the community, and the environment."
