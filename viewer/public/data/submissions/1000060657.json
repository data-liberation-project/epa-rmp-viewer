Throughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented (as applicable) including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards. The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, and Anhydrous Ammonia Processes include the following PSM system elements: process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; emergency planning and response. Mechanical integrity program element is not applicable for this plant since it's a warehousing facility.

The Mason Plant EAP is derived from the Ingham County LEPC, SARA Title III, Fixed Site Response Plan which includes: means of reporting releases, fires and other emergencies to the Ingham County 911 Dispatch Center; evacuation procedures and emergency escape route assignments; reference to applicable procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; procedures to account for all employees and other personnel on site after an emergency evacuation; rescue and medical duties for employees as appropriate; name(s)of Mason plant personnel or job title(s) who can be contacted for plant information or EAP duties, and information used by off-site responders to bring the emergency under control. The plan is reviewed annually by plant personnel, Mason Fire Department and other outside response agencies as appropriate. The plan is approved as a guideline for response to a hazardous materials incident requiring off-site response at the Mason plant and is consistent with the Ingham County and City of Lansing Emergency Operations Plans. The Mason EAP/Fixed Site Response Plan is exercised by plant management with the Mason Fire Chief determining date, time and type of exercise.\r\nThe PSM Program is reviewed and audited annually with areas for improvement documented and tracked to completion.

The processes involved for these regulated substances consists of movement and storage of these substances in their original containers. The process of movement includes unloading from the delivery truck, movement of these regulated substances in the warehouse and loading of the truck for delivery to their markets. The process of storage includes both internal warehousing of these regulated substances inside the building and external storage within a fenced and locked area. This secure storage area is located on the southwest side of the plant and inside the perimeter fence of the Mason plant. The PSM and RMP regulatory requirements are not applicable to the transportation of these regulated toxic substances.\r\nThere were four Worse Case toxic release scenarios and six Alternate Case toxic release scenarios assessed for the Mason plant. Section 2 of this RMP submittal contains additional details regarding each Worse Case release scenario while Section 3 contains additional details for each Alternate Case release scenario. \r\n\r\nThe four Worse Case toxic release scenarios are briefly described and include: (1) structural fire involving a 9600# chlorine release of 64 cylinders (150#/ cylinder) with a distance to endpoint (urban) of 1.9 miles. Cylinders stored inside building; (2) structural fire involving a 6000# anhydrous sulfur dioxide release of 40 cylinders (150#/cylinder) with a distance to endpoint (urban)  of 1.6 miles.  Cylinders stored inside building; (3) structural fire involving a 9800# anhydrous ammonia release of 40 cylinders (140#/ cylinder) with a distance to endpoint (urban) of 0.9 miles.

Fire exposure causes fusible plugs to open resulting in release with distance to end point (urban) of 0.3 miles; and (6) sulfur dioxide stored in 1 ton container located in outside fenced area within plant perimeter. Fire exposure causes fusible plugs to open resulting in release with distance to end point (urban) of 0.2 miles. \r\nTo ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or more likely. EPA's RMP CompTM was the release model used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process. Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this EPA submittal. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly"
