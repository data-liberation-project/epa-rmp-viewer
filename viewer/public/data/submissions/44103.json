      "SummaryText": "Evans Chemetics\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nJune 2004\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Evans Chemetics are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Seneca County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program regulation\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n* The certification that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n* The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nEvans Chemetics was formed in Waterloo during the early 1940s to manufacture divalent sulfur compounds for the hair care and cosmetic industries.  Since that time, the number of products has grown to over 50, serving the cosmetic, plastics, and specialty che"

The products manufactured are sold to other manufactures as raw materials and ingredients in their final products.\n\nIn our processes, Evans Chemetics uses two regulated substances, acrylonitrile [2-propenenitrile] and epichlorohydrin [oxirane, (chloromethyl)-].  Acrylonitrile is used to manufacture a variety of products, including secondary antioxidants for plastics and rubber and polymerization chain transfer agents.  Epichlorohydrin is used to manufacture products used in the photographic, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEvans Chemetics has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  We have an air operating permit ID under Title V of the Clean Air Act.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nEvans Chemetics maintains safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Process safety information includes Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specification sheets and maintenance manuals, reactive chemical data, and materials of construction information.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The Dow Reactive Chemical / Process Hazard Analysis methodology is used to carry out these analyses, along with the Dow Fire & Explosion Index, Chemical Exposure Index, Layer of Protection Analysis, and HAZOP methodologies.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified pers"

      "SummaryText": "Evans Chemetics.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEvans Chemetics conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEvans Chemetics promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEvans Chemetics truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Evans Chemetics has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and are required to inform Evans Chemetics of any hazards they may introduce at the site.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nEvans Chemetics"

      "SummaryText": "has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release of acrylonitrile or epichlorohydrin during this period as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances.\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nAll plant personnel are trained to recognize and respond to any release of chemicals.  In addition, a number of people have received advanced emergency response training, and have the equipment and capability to properly respond to any chemical release.  In addition to Evans Chemetics' own emergency response capability, emergency planning and response is coordinated with the Seneca County LEPC (Local Emergency Response Committee).  \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of Evans Chemetics' ongoing program to improve safety within the facility and reduce risk to the surrounding community, our processes and procedures are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.  Currently we are implementing or planning to implement the following risk reduction or prevention activities:\nEvans Chemetics is starting to use the Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) PHA methodology as an additional tool to both analyze the potential process risks and to ensure the site has the proper layers of protection to mitigate those risks. Equipment and process changes are currently underway to reduce the inventory of hazardous chemicals both in the process and on site to minimize risk  Automatic block valves are being installed on additional bulk storage tanks to isolate the tanks when the chemicals are not being actively transferred to the process. \n\nAs additional risk reduction opportunities are identified, they will be added to the above list."
