      "SummaryText": "The Commonwealth Oil Refining Co., Inc. (CORCO) owns and operates a Petroleum Bulk Storage Terminal (NAICS Code 49319) at its facilities located between the Municipalities of Guayanilla and Penuelas, Puerto Rico. One of the commodities managed by CORCO is Liquefied Petroleum Gas or LPG, of which Butane (CAS No. 106-97-8) is presently its main component, due to seasonal market conditions. LPG or butane is received from ocean going vessel at its Marine Terminal located at the Bahia de Guayanilla, stored at its stationary storage facilities located within its South Tank Farm, and loaded into trucks at its truck loading rack.  CORCO Handles butane - a flammable substance - above regulatory threshold levels in its South Tank Farm.  The volumes handled at the Marine Terminal exceed the threshold of 10,000 lbs. for LPG/butane  \r\nRelease scenarios and offsite consequence analysis have been defined by the use of EPA RMP Comp tool and EPA guidelines for Propane facilities. Containment dikes were installed under the two LPG spheres around March 2014, each containing near 800,000 lbs. of product.  RMP Comp modelling has shown radius for  complete spillage of a sphere (worst case scenario) to be around 0.8 miles.              \r\nCORCO is subject to Prevention Program 3.   As part of these requirements, CORCO has Process Safety Information available to its employees, contractors and visitors. No processing is done onsite. Drawings and technical data is available at its \"Mechanical Files Room\" and are presently being updated. The last Process Hazards Analysis was performed on November 2013 for the proposed installation of ROV's currently underway. Operating Procedures supplemented by special instructions from supervisory personnel are available at the different control Operation department offices, particularly at Caseta #4, adjacent to LPG/Butane Tank Farm and truck loading rack Safety and Emergency Response procedures are in effect and address the most important safety issues."

      "SummaryText": "The LHG Operation Manual developed to comply with US Coast Guard's requirements for our Marine Terminal governs most of our activities at that facility. \r\nMost of the training to operators is on-the-job by senior personnel. Inspection of equipment and piping is done as per applicable technical codes and standards. Pressure vessels are inspected once per year as required by Puerto Rico regulations. In most cases, changes to equipment after being reviewed by local personnel have to be certified by corresponding outside inspectors. LPG facilities in Puerto Rico are also inspected by the governmental Public Service Commission. Audits of compliance with applicable requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 are being conducted once every three years, or whenever significant changes to facilities or to regulations make necessary a revision of this RMP. The investigation of incidents and the issuance of hot work permits is done as per written procedures. Representatives of the different operating groups of our employees are allowed to participate in PHAs (Process Hazard Analyses). Contractors are subject to CORCO's safety procedures and practices. CORCO mostly relies on its internal resources to respond to releases, but is also an active member of a mutual aid organization named CIMAO. Its main emergency response procedures are its Facility Response Plan and the LHG Emergency Manual, each developed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements."
