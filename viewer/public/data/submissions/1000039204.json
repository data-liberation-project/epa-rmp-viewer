Staff, support all the activities and proper actions required in order to comply with the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency the Department of Transportation and the Local Fire Department.\n\n\n\nOur prevention program was developed mostly with information gathered from the different Chlorine Institute pamphlets and from our suppliers of Chlorine (Jones Chemical).Our emergency response plan includes the participation of the Plant Operators, the Engineer in Charge, the Fire Department and the Local Civil Defense Office. All safety, heath, prevention and emergency information is available. We consider that the most important element related to the accident prevention program and the emergency response plan, is the employee's knowledge of the, product-process-equipment (operational & safety), involved in this operation. We expect to accomplish this through continuous training and practice. \n\n\n\nII- The sodium hypoclorite\n\nManufacturing facility at our site, started in July 1997. Our products is registered and regulated by the EPA and the Agricultural Dept. As a pesticide. Recently it was certified by the National Standard Foundation for drinking water disinfection and can be used also for waste water disinfection. The plant location is outside-north\n\n(Road # 185) the urban zone of the city of Juncos, PR.  The manufacturing process combines the use of tanks, pumps, pipes, valves, heat exchangers, chillers and process control devices. Raw materials used are: Caustic Soda (50% liquid), and Chlorine (liquified gas) in 2000 lbs. containers.  We store some 150 lbs. Chlorine cylinders for resale. Chlorine is a toxic gas that can cause damage to human, animal and vegetation. There are always two persons in the plant when in operation. The process of manufacturing sodium "

We have two chlorine sensors with alarms and the proper safety equipment available in the plant. Plant operators are well trained in the use of both process and safety equipment.\n\n\n\nIII - We used RMP Comp to determinate the scenario. The WCS assumes the complete failure of the largest vessel at the facility, in the case a 2,000 pounds cylinder, in 10 minutes. The release rate of 200 pounds per min. With no mitigation measures in a rural zone was used. Estimated distance to endpoint is 3.0 miles for toxic level of 0.0087 mg/L (ERPG-2).\n\nOther assumptions were: wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., stability class - F and temperature of 77 egress F.\n\nThe estimated residential population to toxic endpoint obtained was 24,400, using the 1990 US Census.\n\nPublic receptor includes, schools, residences, hospitals, recreation, commercial, office and industrial areas.\n\nThe ARS assumes the venting of 50 lbs of excess chlorine from the top of a reactor with no migration measures in a rural zone was used. Estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 1 miles for 0.0087 mg/l (ERPG-2). Other assumptions were speed of 3 meter/sec., stability class D and a temperature of 77 degree F. The estimated residential population to toxic endpoint obtain was 1,100 using the 1990 US Census. Public receptors in both cases, environmental receptors include National Forests and Wilderness areas. \n\n\n\nIV - The most important practices in our accident release prevention program are as following: We will always use containers, hose, clamps, adapters, valves, pipes, emergency kits, wrenches, SCBA and other related equipment to handle Chlorine, that are approved by the DOT, OSHA and the Chlorine Institute. - Operators will be continuously trained in the use of above equipment. There will always be two operators when chlorinating. We will keep periodic in"

The incident was reported to the NRC and produced no injuries. We have an emergency response program in place since July 1997 that includes the support from various local agencies like the Fire Dept. and the Civil Defense.
