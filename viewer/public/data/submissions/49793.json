ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n     Salina Further Processing recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of ammonia release incidents is the basic responsibility of all Salina Further Processing personnel who operate the Ammonia Process.\n     The Salina Further Processing PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its Ammonia Operating and Management Systems.  The Salina Further Processing PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based Ammonia Refrigeration System  , It is not \"Paperwork\" Salina Further Processing expects to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n     Salina Further Processing believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP program.  All members of the Operating Team must be involved.  They assume major responsibility for operating the Ammonia process safely.\n     The Salina Further Processing Emergency Action Program has been developed.  All Salina Further Processing employees have received documented emergency Action training. \nII. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n     Salina Further Processing operates an Ammonia Based Ammonia Refrigeration System. Ammonia is a common industrial chemical with applications in a large number of industries such as Agriculture, Water Treatment, Food Storage Warehouses, Pharmaceuticals, Heat Treating and many, many more. Ammonia has been listed by both EPA and OSHA as Hazardous Substance. \nIII. SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS \nDispersion cloud modeling studies have been performed as required by PSM/RMP regulations and the information developed has been used in the preparation of the Technical Studies and Reports th"

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     Salina Further Processing will conduct an annual (as well as the required Tri-Annual OSHA audit) PSM/RMP progress audit of their PSM/RMP program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements. Salina Further Processing considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be a \"living\" documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability and usefulness.\n     Salina Further Processing emphasizes and insists on \"employee participation\" from their ammonia process operators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n    Salina Further Processing provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program and a Training Management System with \"one-on-one\" teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia process employee.\n     Salina Further Processing maintains a pro-active \"open-door\" policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request. \nV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n     The Salina Further Processing Ammonia Refrigeration System facility is a very old process. There have been no releases of ammonia during the past five years that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site. \nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nAll Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia releases. They are trained to take \"Emergency Actions\" to control an ammonia release where the ammonia atmosphere is less than the IDLH. Some employees are trained and equipped to use SCBA Breathing Apparatus.  \nVII. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n      Salina Further Processing recognizes that even good PSM/RMP Programs require constant attention and \nimprovement.  The PSM/RMP program"

Ammonia Process Managers and Operators have been deeply involved in Verifying P&ID's, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections. \n\n(2)    EXPANDED USE OF THEIR PSM/RMP WEB-SITE:  The Salina Further Processing PSM/RMP Program is:  (a) computer based, (b)user friendly,  (c) includes \"one-on-one\" involvement with specified and qualified trainers,  (d) written to minimize paperwork and maximize documentation, and  (e) written to be understood and used by both Ammonia Managers and Process Operators.  The web-site makes all information developed by the PSM/RMP Program available to all employees who have a User Name and Password.  All Salina Further Processing employees have an assigned User Name and Password. \n\n(3)  PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS: All recommendations developed during the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) were designed to improve the safety performance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. Salina Further Processing has evaluated each PHA recommendation.  Each recommendation will be evaluated and installed or rejected based on its technical merits. Salina Further Processing intent is to reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release. \n\n(4) AUDITS:   Programs are audited Tri-Annually as required by the OSHA PSM to improve Safety Performance as well as to verify compliance with the PSM/RMP Regulations. \n\n(5) STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES:  SOP's are certified annually to be current and correct. They are revised as often as necessary"

Renewal training, including documented training tests are provided annually. \n\n(7)  PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS:  Critical Ammonia Equipment is routinely inspected and maintained according to manufacturer?s recommendations."
