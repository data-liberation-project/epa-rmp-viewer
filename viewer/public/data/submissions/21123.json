              "Description": "VWR has compiled information that is necessary for safe handling and storage of regulated chemical products.  This information includes:\n\n* Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each regulated chemical.  This information is available electronically or as hard copy.  The latest MSDS revision was 1998;\n\n* Maximum intended inventory of equipment in which regulated chemicals are stored.  (i.e., the maximum intended container size is 20 liters);\n\n* Acceptable storage temperatures and conditions for flammable substances.\n\n* Equipment use and maintenance specifications (use and maintenance specifications for forklifts, storage racks, and other equipment are maintained on file at the facility);\n\n* Codes and standards used to design and build the facility: NFPA 30 (Flammable and Combustible Liquids), NFPA 231 (Standard for General Storage), NFPA 231c (Standard for Rack Storage of Materials).\n\n\nHAZARD REVIEW\n\nThe hazard associated with the regulated chemical, ethyl ether, is:\n\n* Flammability\n\nVWR periodically reviews and audits its operations to identify and control potential hazards.  The most recent review was completed on March 21, 2000.  The review was conducted using, as a guide, the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Warehouse Assessment Protocol.  This document cited in EPA's guidance document Risk Management Program for Warehouses (40 CFR 68), as providing a suitable framework for conducting a hazard review.  Additionally, facility personnel and other persons familiar with warehouse operations provided input to the hazard review process.\n\nThe major hazards identified during this review were:\n* Fire and/or Explosion\n* Equipment Failure\n* Tornado\n\nCurrent facility management practices were deemed appropriate to prevent a fire and explosion hazards during normal facility operation and  foreseeable emergencies.  For example, the existence of standard operating procedures and training programs help minimize the risk of human error associated with normal facility operations.  Similarly, daily inspection of forklifts and the use of standard checklists, help ensure that forklifts do not fail while in use for materials handling.\n\nIf a chemical release were to occur, it would be first detected by an operator, either visually or by odor.  Once detected, the facility has direct-reading combustible vapor detection equipment that can determine the flammable concentration in air.\n\nMitigation systems and equipment are available for use by trained VWR emergency response personnel in the event of a release.  Spilled liquids can be confined, absorbed and containerized for later disposal.  Mitigation systems for fire and explosion include a system of sprinklers, dikes, fire walls and blast panels.\n\nAlthough findings from the hazard review were favorable, action items were identified as follows:\n\n* Label storage racks with maximum weight capacity to prevent overload and damage to the rack.\n\nThe anticipated completion date of the action items is March 21, 2001.\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nVWR maintains written procedures for most operations.  Appendix C of VWR's Risk Management Plan identifies procedures relating to normal start-up and routine operations; Section 2 for procedures relating to emergency shutdown.  Section 2 includes procedures for temporary operations during an emergency.  The issuance or revision date is shown on procedures to indicate the date of last revision.\n\n\nTRAINING\n\nVWR provides employee training for routine operations and emergency situations.  The training process can include one or more instructional formats, such as lecture, videotape, interactive computer-based training, hands-on exercises, demonstrations and on the job training.  Training is conducted by a qualified instructor or other competent person.  Employee proficiency may be evaluated using one or more techniques, most often including actual hands-on demonstration of the activity or technique.\n\nVWR has reviewed the capabilities of existing employees and determined that the employees possess the knowledge, skill and ability to perform their duties in accordance with operating procedures.  A written certification to this effect has been prepared and is on file at VWR acknowledging the training and competency of all individuals named in the risk management plan.\n\nNew employees and employees who are transferred to new responsibilities receive training prior to starting the job.  This ensures that all employees understand and can perform their duties in accordance with operating procedures.\n\nEmployees will be retrained whenever operating procedures are significantly revised, and at least once every three years, even if procedures have not been changed.  Specific OSHA, DOT and EPA training requirements may also dictate more frequent training.\n\nFor administrative efficiency, training under this section may be combined with any other employee training provided by VWR.\n\nVWR has formally asked each of its on-site contractors to certify in writing that their people working on-site have been trained in accordance with the proper safety and environmental health standards, and they currently adhere to all applicable regulations for the same.\n\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\nVWR maintains a list of process equipment that requires routine inspection and maintenance.  There are written procedures relating to inspection and maintenance requirements.  Personnel responsible for inspection and maintenance are trained on these procedures.  These procedures are typically developed by VWR or are obtained from equipment manufacturers.\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nVWR will conduct an audit at least every three (3) years to evaluate compliance with Prevention Program requirements.  The first audit will be completed no later than March 21, 2003.  Findings and recommended corrective actions will be put in writing, and corrective actions will be implemented in a timely manner.  Upon completion of corrective actions VWR will provide a written certification that the compliance evaluations have been completed.  All written records relating to compliance audits will be retained for at least five (5) years.\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nVWR's emergency procedures include provision for conducting an investigation and analysis of each incident in which the emergency plan is activated.  Because VWR investigates all incidents, this procedure satisfies the requirement that VWR investigate each incident that \"resulted in, or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.\"\n\nEach incident report or corrective actions will be put in writing.  Corrective actions will be implemented promptly.  The results of the investigation will be reviewed with affected workers (VWR and vendors) whose job tasks are relevant  to the incident.  The incident report will be retained for a minimum of five (5) years.",

The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved containers (typically ranging from 1 gallon to 55 gallons in volume).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well-being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single \"covered process\" for regulatory purposes.  The VWR facility is considered to be covere under the Program 2 eligibility requirements (per 68.10(c)) because VWR is not covered by one of the SIC codes listed under Program 3 nor OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nAt the present time, only Ethyl Ether exceeds the Threshold Quantity (TQ) for that substance under federal Clean Air Act 112(r) with a maximum quantity in 1999 of 12,000 lbs as compared to the 10,000 lb TQ.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a hypothetical incident in which the single largest container stored at the site, a 20 liter metal can/drum, is pierced by a forklift and/or the contents are otherwise spilled on the floor of the distribution center.  RMP Comp, a software program furnished by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was used to determine the farthest distance to the \"flammable end"

There are no residences, schools, hospitals or environmentally sensitive areas within that distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a more realistic hypothetical incident in which a single one-gallon container of ethyl ether is dropped on the floor.  According to the analysis, the distance to the flammable endpoint was also equal to one-tenth of a mile (0.1 mile) or less.  The alternative release scenario endpoint was calculated based on EPA's vapor cloud fire release type.\n\nAdministrative controls and active mitigation measures were not included as a factor of consideration during the worst case or alternative release scenarios.  However, both release scenarios considered indoor releases contained by dikes or berms in the flammable storage room.\n\nVWR's prevention program consists of several key elements, including:\n\n* Safety Information - includes detailed information about the hazards of the regulated chemicals, maximum intended inventory, facility design features, applicable standards, equipment use and maintenance.\n\n* Hazard Review - a process of evaluating facility operations, using warehouse industry checklists, to identify and control potential hazards.\n\n* Standard Operating Procedures - written SOPs to guide employees in safely conducting normal, temporary and non-routine/emergency operations.\n\n* Training - includes training commensurate with the types of activities employees are expected to perform during normal and emergency situations.\n\n* Maintenance - required maintenance activities are performed by trained employees or qualified workers.\n\n* Compliance Audits - conducted at least once every three years to verify compliance with regulatory requirements for Accidental Release Prevention.\n\n* Incident Investigation - conducted whenever an incident occurs that results in, or could have resulted in, a"

      "SummaryText": " catastrophic release (i.e., a release that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment).\n\nThe need for chemical specific prevention steps is very limited because chemicals are contained within sealed DOT-approved containers, and the containers are not opened during handling.  Additionally, all chemicals are segregated and stored by hazard class to ensure that incompatible chemicals are not stored together.\n\nThere have been no accidents in the previous five years that have resulted in any deaths or significant property damage on-site, or any off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering from regulated substances or otherwise.  However, VWR has developed a comprehensive emergency response program that addresses small and large-scale incidents, including coordination with outside agencies and responders."
