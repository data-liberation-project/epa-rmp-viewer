      "SummaryText": "\nBecause chlorine is covered under OSHA's Hazardous Materials Program (29CFR1910.120), it requires a Haz Mat team, which we do not have on the premise; to contain a chlorine release. For this reason, we have arranged for a Haz Mat team to be notified in Gastonia, a neighboring town, should a chlorine release occur.  Jim Pharr, Gaston County's LEPC will also be notified, and will handle the coordination of the Emergency Services involved.  We are currently working with the City of Mount Holly (of which we are subsidiary), to fashion a plan for notifiying the community in case of a chlorine release.  We expect to have this plan in operation prior to March 1,2000.                                                                                                                                                         *We do not perform welding operations at our facility; however the program designated our lack of a date under Hot Work Permits, to be a \"record error\".  We have therefore, designated the date of 11/1/99 as the last date on which we issued a Hot Work Permit."
