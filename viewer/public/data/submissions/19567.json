THE FACILITY POLICY:\nThe owners, management and the employees of the Rocky Ford Growers Cooperative Association are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION:\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nA.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.\n\nB.  The maximum quantity stored would be 84,000 lbs.  in our 18,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.  WORST CASE SCENARIO:\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm is 0.83 miles.)\n\nA.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm is 0.22 miles.)\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:\nThe facility has implemented the previsions of  \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U. S.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR, 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nA.  have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor\n\nB.  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering "

A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nB.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluation are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
