To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance\" section of the RMP/CAPP has been prepared and implemented. Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate. This facility processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) that is trucked in from various oil and gas producing facilities.  High pressure gas from field wells is sent to different gas plants whereby NGL liquids are extracted and stored in pressurized tanks, which is then transported to this facility for further processing. The NGL is removed from this facility by tank truck. This facility is subject to the RMP/CAPP requirements since it is a natural gas processing facility and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances. Since this facility is a Program 3, a documented prevention program is required. This program is discussed in the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance\" Part II of the RMP/CAPP as prepared for the facility. The prevention program does discuss NGL which is the specific chemical contained in an amount above the threshold quantity. The facility has not experienced an accident within the past five years. Because this facility is a Program 3 covered process, a written emergency response program is required. This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" Part II of the RMP/CAPP as prepared for the facility. Further, an Emergency Plan for NGL Release has been developed and can be found at the front of this manual, and contains procedures that will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release. Basically, the instructions are to evacuate t"
