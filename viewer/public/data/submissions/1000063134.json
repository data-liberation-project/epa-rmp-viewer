The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program(mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components,and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices(such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to operate or work on the refrigeration system. Supervalu also has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure that the PSM/RMP program is being implemented  at the facility. Lastly, the PSM/RMP written program incorporates the SuperValu Fort Wayne facility's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.

To date SuperValu's Fort Wayne DC has not experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected employees, residents or the environment.\n\n\n\n3.0    WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each process.  See supporting letter for details the worst and alternate case release scenarios and other scenarios considered.\n\n\n\n4.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nPursuant to RMP/PSM regulations, SuperValu has developed a comprehensive PSM/RMP written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals located on site. The facility completed an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and subsequent 5 Year PHA Revalidations for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA's were completed us"
