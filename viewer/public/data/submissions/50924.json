      "SummaryText": "Norquick Distributing Company is a small business engaged in the storage and distribution of frozen foods. It operates entrily out of a single business site located in Canton, Michigan. It is a father and son operation with the father primarily retired, and the business by son, a Financial Accounting Manager, and an Operations/ Warehouse Manager. Norquick's frozen foods distribution facility was orginally constructed in 1997. It has 60,000 square feet of refrigerated storage space, and was designed to accommadate future expansion of that storage space up to an additional 60,000 square feet. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammounia as a refrigent. Norquick's anhydrous ammonia storage facilities are constructed to accommadate the planned future expansions and have a design storage capacity of approximately 12,000 pounds. This amount is substantially greater than the capacity required to service Norquick's current refrigerated stroage space."
