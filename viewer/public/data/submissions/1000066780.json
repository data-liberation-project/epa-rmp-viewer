The plan includes a regular preventive maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for\n\nthe ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of\n\nchanges (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the\n\nsafe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe\n\napproaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to\n\nwork on the refrigeration system. Schreiber Foods has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to\n\nensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of\n\nincidents. The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is\n\nbeing implemented at the Richland Center East facility. Lastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Schreiber\n\nFoods facility's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of\n\nammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency\n\nresponse organizations.\n\n\n\n",
