We recognize that activities at this facility may impact our employees and the surrounding community. Because of this, Shell is dedicated to environmental protection, employee health and safety, regulatory compliance and pollution prevention through a strategy of continual improvement and teamwork.\n\nOur company environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this facility, our employees, and the public. This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. Shell is committed to complying with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations, Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of methane. This program enables the facility to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of methane.\n\nIt is Shell\u0092s policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment. Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Shell RNG, Galloway \u0096 Biogas Facility located at 21048 2 Road, Plains, Kansas conducts a biogas production process that generates methane (74-82-8). The facility is classified as a Prevention Program 3 and is regulated by EPA RMP and OSHA PSM for the flammable substance methane which is held on site in excess of 10,000 lbs. \n\nPotential Release Scenarios\nThe RMP models one worst-case scenario and two alternative-case scenarios. The worst-case scenario was prepar"

The endpoint used was an overpressure of one pound per square inch (psi) and at a distance of 0.3 miles. Within that distance, public receptors are limited to commercial/office/industrial areas. No residence or environmental receptors are located within this distance. The worst-case scenario capacity of methane is a maximum; usually 17 feet of digestate, a non-flammable liquid, is normally present in the vessel which limits the total stored quantity of methane to 19,000 pounds or less.\n\nThe RMP also considers alternative-case scenarios, which are events more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. The alternative case scenarios were prepared according to the regulations in Title 40 CFR Part 68.28(e) as follows:\nThe owner or operator shall consider the following in selecting alternative release scenarios: \n(1) The five-year accident history provided in \u00a768.42; and \n(2) Failure scenarios identified under \u00a768.50 or \u00a768.67.\n\nFor the facility, the first alternative-case scenario (ARS 1) was considered a vapor cloud fire resulting from the simultaneous opening of two pressure relief valves (PRVs) associated with Digester #1 and also includ"

The endpoint used was the lower flammability limit (LFL) at a distance of 0.1 miles. The same receptor parameters were used as in the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe second alternative-case scenario (ARS 2) involved the puncture of piping/tubing associated with the Finished Bio-gas Product pipe, resulting in a \u00bd-inch hole and causing the release of up to 151 pounds lbs/min methane. When provided no option in RMP*eSubmit to provide a release rate or a duration of the release, a conservative 28,000 lbs from the worst-case scenario was used to indicate total methane quantity released. The endpoint used was the lower flammability limit (LFL) at a distance of 0.1 miles. The same receptor parameters were used as in the worst-case scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe facility is new in 2023 and has not had a release of a regulated substance that has caused any injuries to employees or impacted any offsite receptors in the past five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \nAn ERP has been developed by JES to provide a formal emergency preparedness program that protects human health and property in the event of an emergency such as fire, medical, severe weather event, etc. This plan also formalizes the arrangements with local police, fire departments, hospitals, and emergency response personnel in case of an event.  A copy of this plan is reviewed with each employee.\n\nPlanned Changes \nShell continues to review its programs and procedures and make improvements where necessary. At this time, no significant improvement needs have been identified."
