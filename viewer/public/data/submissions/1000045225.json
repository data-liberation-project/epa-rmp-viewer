From the grapes grown in our vineyards we follow an age-old enjoyable tradition of human activity in producing delicious wines to celebrate life.  Located just southwest of the city of King City in the fertile Salinas Valley of California, our winery is a significant contributor to the state's economy as a part of the wine industry.  In association with our parent company we produce a large quantity and variety of wines for our international customer base.\r\nThe values and guiding principles adopted for operating the winery are incorporated into our ISO Quality statement. The Delicato Family vineyards and wineries successfully and profitably produce, package and sell the highest quality wine within our competitive set. With a focus on the continual improvement of our quality management system, we are responsive; customer oriented, and conducts business in an ethical manner. We foster an environment of fairness, safety and personal growth for our employees.\r\nThe company meets all regulatory requirements for safety and the environmental regulations and ensures that a full exchange of information pertaining to compliance is maintained. The company on a regular basis reviews and/or updates its PSM program for Cal OSHA compliance and the RMP for EPA, CalARP and CUPA compliance. We also review our Hazardous Waste Business Plan for the EPA, state DTSC and the Monterey County. \r\nThe company and employees dedicate themselves to be active, good citizens in their community and industry. All employees are encouraged to be active participants in endeavors directed toward improving the quality of life or supportive of growth in the community or industry. \r\nOur business begins with the soil in which we grow many acres of vines that produce high quality grapes.

      "SummaryText": "ultural practices, which provide optimum development of the fruit. During the fall harvest season, the grapes are picked according to specific quality criteria and delivered to the winery to be processed into wine. Transported from the vineyard by trucks, grapes of many varieties arriving in 6-ton bins are separated into specific lots for crushing. The crushing process separates the thousands of gallons of juice from the skins, seeds and stems of the grapes to prepare the juice to become wine. This conversion process of juice to wine is called fermentation, and is accomplished with a microscopic organism called yeast. Wine lots of 3,000 to 350,000 gallons are then moved through various processes to clarify, consolidate, blend and finish into a product that is ready for our customers to consume. Many thousands of gallons of wine flow through miles of pipelines and numerous pieces of equipment and tanks of various shapes and sizes before reaching the final destination, the customer's glass.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia Processes\r\nDuring our winemaking process there are many stages where refrigeration of the juice or wine is important to retain certain quality characteristics. One system installed in our facility to perform this task utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant chemical.\r\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency lists anhydrous ammonia as an Extremely Hazardous Substance with a Threshold Planning Quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The process refrigeration equipment at Delicato Vineyards uses ammonia as the refrigerant gas. The system is comprised of one vessel with a quantity of ~19,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a fixed installation set on concrete foundations. The system consists of two compressors, a condenser, evaporator, associated piping, valves, electrical power and controls for safe operation.  The system is dedicated to maintain jacket temperature of wine tanks throughout the winery. The thermodynamic reactio"

The period of heaviest refrigeration use is during the grape harvest season, usually from August through November.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia has been a commonly used refrigerant gas for decades because it is highly efficient. Ammonia is a naturally occurring compound. Ammonia has also been extensively used as a primary fertilizer in our country's prosperous agriculture industry for many years through a process of direct injection into the soil. It is commonly used in many households as a cleaner for windows, floors and countertops. Treated with respect, ammonia provides tremendous benefit in the processes in which it is used to enhance our country's economy. Interestingly, ammonia-related deaths and injuries are more common from misuse of household ammonia used for cleaning purposes than from the millions of tons of anhydrous ammonia used around the world for industrial and agricultural processes.\r\nBeing classified as a hazardous material, ammonia can be dangerous if it is mishandled. The concentrated liquid can freeze tissue and cause chemical burns. In a gaseous form of sufficient strength, it can be inhaled to cause immediate burning of lung tissue. This is why extensive safety precautions and equipment are in place at our facility using anhydrous ammonia. Since our previous RMP submittal we have updated equipment drawings of the refrigeration package and increased the amount of labeling on each valve and pipe within the refrigeration package. The company committed to this improvement to increase the level of awareness within the company's refrigeration technician population and to increase the standardization of the process. The company has also installed a state-of-the-art control panel that allows for a user to monitor all safety and operating parameters in one location"

In the event of a release, an emitting refrigeration package could be isolated and shutdown remotely thus decreasing the response time and corrective action time in the event of a discharge. Structural barricades have also been erected around refrigeration packages that are susceptible to heavy internal traffic, transporting grapes, or grape processing material. The company has also improved the procedures of routine maintenance operation and the internal mechanical integrity program. All of these improvements were conceived from cross-functional review meetings designed to increase the quality of the company's RMP.\r\n\r\nThe Five-Year Accident History\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia Accidental Releases: During the last five years there were no reportable accidents involving anhydrous ammonia at our winery. There were no onsite deaths, injuries, or property damage. There were no off-site consequences, deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nIn the event of an emergency situation involving an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia Delicato Monterey Winery will activate components of its Emergency Response Plan. The plan is intended to minimize the serious effects of an event through preparation and training. Components of the Plan that accomplish this are as follows:\r\n\u00bf\tPre-emergency planning, including scenario drills and coordination with outside emergency providers.\r\n\u00bf\tDefinition of personnel roles for recognizing, preventing, and maintaining site security and control.\r\n\u00bf\tA communication system for alerting personnel for response procedures, evacuation to safe refuges and coordination with outside responders.\r\n\u00bf\tProvisions for medical treatment, first aid, and decontamination.\r\n\u00bf\tOrganization and training of Emergency Response Team with necessary personal prote"
