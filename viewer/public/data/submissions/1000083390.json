      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary \n\n\n\nNevada Power Company d/b/a NV Energy owns the Goodsprings Energy Recovery Station (Goodsprings) and is the designated operator for this facility.  Goodsprings is located adjacent to the Kern River Gas Transmission Company's (Kern River) Gas Pipeline Compressor Station near Goodsprings, NV. The Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) at Goodsprings is fueled by waste heat from a Kern River compressor turbine exhaust that is transferred from thermal energy into mechanical energy. This is accomplished by utilizing the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology. The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a Waste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat transfer fluid. The thermal oil is then circulated to the shell and tube vaporizer of the OEC. The motive fluid (pentane) on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive a special organic fluid turbine. This turbine, which rotates at 1800 rpm, drives a generator which produces grid compatible power. The pentane then passes through a heat exchanger and enters the cycle again as a liquid. After exiting the various heat exchangers, the thermal oil passes through the thermal oil surge tanks and the thermal oil feed pumps, which discharge it into the WHOH. The power from this project will be delivered to NV Energy's Jean substation via a 69 kV transmission line for distribution.\n\n\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as a binary working fluid. Liquid pentane is pumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. In the heat exchangers, thermal energy provided by thermal oil is transferred to the pentane. This heat input causes the pentane to change physical states from liquid to high pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric power. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to complete the cycle. A pentane storage tank is available for ma"

      "SummaryText": "keup. The facility design is segregated into multiple sections, each having its own design specifications dictated by the pentane conditions in that section. The sections include: the low pressure process equipment, the high pressure process equipment, pentane unloading system, vapor recovery system, evacuation system and non-condensable removal system. Each section is protected by pressure relief systems that may include pressure safety valves, pressure control valves, control system shutdown and intervention logic and administrative practices.\n\n\n\nQuantities Handled or Stored\n\n\n\nThe design inventory of the system consists of pentane present both as a gas and as a liquid. The nominal maximum liquid inventory exists when the facilities are not operating. At that time the energy in the pentane is reduced and most of the inventory is present as a liquid in the liquid process vessels. The maximum inventory at this facility is estimated at 11,982 gallons, or 62,646 lbs of pentane.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario Description\n\n\n\nWorst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns. \n\n\n\nPrevention Program Description\n\n\n\nSafety Information:\n\n\n\nMaintenance procedures: NV Energy has installed and operates a Computerized Maintenance Management software (CMMS) program. The CMMS (Passport) contains information on all equipment in the facility requiring maintenance, inspections, testing, certification, calibration, etc. NFPA, OSHA, manufacturer's recommendations and operations experience have been utilized to produce a comprehensive maintenance work order system that produces maintenance requests at appropriate frequencies. Employees generate \"Corrective work orders\" for the repair or assessment and recognized problem. Routin"

      "SummaryText": "e comprehensive inspections are performed using checklists.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan: The emergency response plan is intended to identify and coordinate personnel in the event there is an emergency.\n\n\n\nTraining: Safety training is conducted and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include electrical safety, fire prevention and protection, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, gas detectors, fire panels, personal protective equipment, and the safe use of tools and equipment. Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Industrial Hygiene and Standard Safety Procedures Manuals.\n\n\n\nCallout procedure: The Goodsprings facility is monitored remotely from the Higgins Generating Station Control Room. If any of the following alarm conditions are indicated by the monitoring system, this call-out procedure must be followed: OEC failure, OEC low output, security/fire alarm trip. If any of these events should occur, the monitoring staff will immediately contact the Operations Manager. \n\n\n\nThe principal methods of accident prevention include equipment design safeguards, written procedures and operator/employee training. The pentane feed pump's isolation valves are double block and bleed ball valves, ensuring safe isolation of pentane during maintenance activities. Safety systems are present in the facilities and have various methods of operation.\n\n\n\nPressure safety systems typically have three levels of degree. The initial degree is an alarm that is presented audibly and visually to the Control Room Operator. The next more severe degree is a shutdown of process equipment likely to be causing or exacerbating the condition and an alarm that is presented audibly and visually to the Control Room Operator. The third and most severe degree of pressure safety system are pressure safety valves (PSV) which relieve to atmosphere or to larger low pressure systems. Some of these PSV's also have Control Ro"

Control Room audio and visual alarms annunciate when concentrations are in excess of 25% of LEL, and do not release until concentrations fall below 20%.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nGoodsprings does not have an accident record at this time.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nGoodsprings has an Emergency Response Plan of which a copy is kept at the Higgins and Goodsprings facilities.  The Emergency Response is based on recognition and observation of potential emergency conditions, and immediate repair, or notification of the primary response agency. The policy for emergency response is to mitigate any accident by implementing emergency procedures that have been developed for all known contingencies. Small fires will be contained and mitigated with fire extinguishing equipment and automatic suppression systems. Emergency notification is required for any release or threatened release of a hazardous material which poses a significant present or potential health, safety or environmental hazard. The Operations Manager is designated incident command when present. The senior operator is designated incident command when management is not present. Incident command is transferred to emergency responders upon arrival.\n\n"
