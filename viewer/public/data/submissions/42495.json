      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) finalized the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP) under Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and subsequently finalized the Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68). This rule established the criteria of the Risk Management Plans (RMPs) required under the ARPP. 40 CFR Part 68 is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances.          The Risk Management Program rule addresses over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 of which are flammable gases, and the accidental release of these substances. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\nThe Northwest Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage of chlorine. The amount of chlorine stored exceeds the threshold limit specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation. The Northwest WTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed a RMP that contains the following required information:\n* A management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\n* A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternative release scenarios and their impacts on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B);\n* A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations. (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C); and\n* An emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E)."

      "SummaryText": "The following subsections discuss details of the plan that have been implemented at the Northwest WTP.\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Northwest WTP facility has excellent safeguards for preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine. The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the McAllen Fire Department, in the event of an emergency. In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the McAllen Fire Department and the in house HAZMAT Team. In house HAZMAT Team will provide the City of McAllen with HAZMAT response. The plant staff will receive training to enable an onsite staff response prior to the arrival of the City of McAllen HAZMAT Team. \nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Northwest WTP uses chlorine as a component of a chloramine disinfectant in the water treatment process. The Northwest WTP regularly maintains 4 one-ton containers of chlorine. This amount translates into a quantity that exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Northwest WTP, located at Mile 5 1/2 and North Bentsen Rd., 8313 N. Bentsen Rd., in McAllen Texas, receives raw water from the Rio Grande River. Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped to the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.\nThe existing chlorine feed facility at the Northwest WTP consists of two process trains. Up to 16 one-ton chlorine containers are used in the train, in addition to two vacuum regulators mounted on an automatic switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves, two flow proportionate feed chlorinators, two flow proportionate rotameters, and two chlorine dioxide generators, and gas piping and ejectors. The potential to generate a release of chlorine gas exists at the chlorine storage areas.\nChlorine is d"

      "SummaryText": "elivered to the Northwest WTP by truck and the containers are stored at the outside storage area, located South of the operations office, inside the Plant Chemical Building, is stored as a pressurized liquid and is removed as a gas from the individual containers. The majority of the chlorine feed system operates under an induced vacuum, making the system extremely safe and minimizing the potential for pressurized leaks along the feed lines. \nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe chlorine storage and process areas have associated hazards that can potentially affect onsite employees and the offsite population and environment. The USEPA requires that a single worst-case release scenario for the facility and one alternative release scenario for each regulated chemical be reported.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario is the one that creates the greatest dispersion of a regulated substance in any direction to an offsite endpoint. The largest potential release of chlorine would occur through a valve failure on a one-ton cylinder located at the plant. This valve failure could potentially release all 2,000 pounds of the chlorine as a gas. Under Section 68.25(c)(1), the release time for a chemical such as chlorine is 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls were not applicable to the worst-case release scenario at this plant.\nThe EPA-approved modeling program, SLAB View- Lakes Environmental Software, was used to characterize the effects of the worst-case chlorine release scenario at the Northwest WTP. The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was determined to be 1.66 miles. The affected residential population is estimated to be 200 people. Commercial, industrial and residential areas would be affected in the worst-case release scenario.\nAlternate Release Scenario\nOne alternative chlorine release scenario was modeled for the Northwest WTP. The release was established as a leak that developed in the packing of a chlorine container valve. A r"

      "SummaryText": "elease of chlorine through the 1/5-inch diameter hole in the valve packing could last for approximately 10 minutes, and is presumed to be observed or detected. The release rate of chlorine caused by leakage through this opening is calculated to be 73.7 pounds per minute. DEGADIS+ was also used to characterize the effects of the alternative release scenario at the Northwest WTP. The distance to the USEPA-defined toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was determined to be 1.16 miles. The affected residential population is estimated to be 150 people. \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Northwest WTP will carry out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine equipment utilizing only fully trained personnel. The management ensures consistent operation by using disciplinary measures for operational deviations.\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Northwest WTP is not Applicable at this time due to the fact that the plant is new.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nManagement of this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program in which immediate evacuation for the plant will occur once the City of McAllen Fire Department has been contacted. The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Plant operators are required to inspect and monitor the plant processes at least every two hours. Accordingly, plant staff will detect any releases of chlorine and then contact the Fire Department.\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the plant evacuation plan, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency response training underway. \nThe McAllen Fire Department has been designated to provide emergency responders and equipment to In house HAZMAT Team. In house HAZMAT Team will support and coordinate response efforts with Incident Command upon arriving at the plant."
