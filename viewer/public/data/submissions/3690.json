This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our water treatment facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to perform onsite response to repair damaged chlorine equipment.  Unforeseeably, if an offsite release does occur, we are coordinated with the Rural Metro Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to respond to a release of chlorine.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  Chlorine is used for disinfection purposes in the treatment of potable water.  Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure.  The vapor pressure of stored chlorine is 6.8 atmospheres (99.89 psi - pounds per square inch).  Chlorine gas is non-flammable, but it is a strong oxidizer that can support combustion of other materials.  Chlorine is a toxic gas that is considered by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to be immediately dangerous to life and health at concentrations exceeding 10 parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 4,000 lbs. (pounds) or two 2,000-lb. cylinders.  The largest single vessel of chlorine at our facility is a 2,000-lb.cylinder.  The chlorine cylinders are equipped with a fusible plug that is designed to fail if the temperature of the cylinder reaches approximately 158( F.  The purpose of the fusible plug is to prevent cylinder failure in the event of an extended, hot fire by allowing a"

No environmental receptors were noted.\n\nThe second alternative-case release scenario was estimated to involve the release of 120 lbs./minute of chlorine from a broken 1/4-inch feed line.  This scenario assumed that the release detection system/automatic shutoffs malfunctioned and the cylinders had to be closed manually by facility personnel.  In this scenario 1,200 lbs. of chlorine was assumed to have been released as a gas over a ten-minute period.  As with the worst-case scenario, the EPA's RMP-Comp model was used assuming an Rural topography setting.  The wind speed was assumed to be 6.7 miles/hour with a stability class of D.  The model determined the distance to the toxic endpoint (i.e., 0.0087 mg/L based on ERPG-2) to be 0.4-mile.  The population within this area is approximately 3 people, according to the 1990 census data.  The only public receptors identified within the radial distance to the toxic endpoint were residences.  No environmental receptors were noted.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA and the process safety management requirements under 29 CFR part 1910.119 (OSHA).    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our water treatment facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe staff of the water treatment facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur water treatment facility personnel conduct studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled ef"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years and whenever a major change is made to the covered process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the water treatment facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe water treatment facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe water treatment facility personnel carry out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; piping systems, ventilation systems, emergency shutdown systems, and controls.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the water treatment facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe water treatment facility personnel conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe water treatment facility personnel promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Knox-Chapman Utility District truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Water treatment facility employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

These models evaluate the Distance to Toxic Endpoint based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2).  These guidelines were developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association to represent the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The ERPG-2 toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L.  We performed the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility using the EPA's RMP-Comp Model, which is an electronic version of the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The release scenario modeling was performed using the EPA RMP-Comp computer program.  This program calculates the distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine depending upon the effects of variable factors.  The wind speed and air stability class, presence of partial enclosures and general topographic types are all factors that affect the model calculations.  The type of release and release rates are also evaluated by the model.\n\nBecause the chlorine storage area/chlorination process equipment is located in a semi-enclosed area the RMP-Comp"

This takes into account the passive mitigation provided by the presence of the structure.  As an example, a 10-minute release of 2,000 lbs. of chlorine (i.e., a linear rate of 200 lbs. per minute) would be modeled as a 10-minute release at a rate of 110 lbs. per minute.\n\nThe population estimate data is produced using 1990 United States Census Bureau data in conjunction with a geographic information system (GIS) computer program.  This data is designed to provide a general information about the population in a given area, but the data is provided by geographic block groups and the local accuracy of the data can be variable. \n\nThe public and environmental receptor data represents a combination of United States Census Bureau data, information obtained from United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and field observations.\n\n The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was estimated to involve the total release of one 2000 lb. cylinder of chlorine.  This is consistent with the regulation definition of a worst-case scenario as the release of the greatest quantity contained in the single largest vessel.  The use of check valves and other release prevention mitigative measures can not be considered for the worst case scenario.  The entire contents of the vessels were assumed to be released as a gas over a 10-minute period.  This type of catastrophe is extremely unlikely and would possibly require the complete failure of the cylinder to occur.  A simple puncture, valve failure or line failure would not be likely to result in a ten-minute release of the contents from the cylinder.

In spite of the setting names, neither of these settings was designed to account for demographic variations).  The wind speed was assumed to be 3.4 miles/hour with a stability class of F, according to EPA guidelines.  This stability class assumes the least amount of potential for air mixing due to turbulence or other factors.  The model determined the distance to the toxic endpoint to be 2.2 miles.  The population within this area is approximately 85 people, according to the 1990 census data.  The public receptors identified within the radial distance to the worst case endpoint included schools, residences, commercial/industrial areas, and churches.  No environmental receptors were identified within the 2.2-mile radius to the toxic endpoint.\n\nAlternative-Case Release Scenarios\n\nTwo alternative-case scenarios were modeled to represent circumstances that were estimated to be more likely to occur at the facility.  One alternative-case release scenario was estimated to involve the release of chlorine from a broken 3/4-inch valve fitting over a ten-minute period (i.e., 787 pounds/minute).  This scenario assumed that the release detection system/automatic shutoffs malfunctioned and the cylinders had to be closed manually by facility personnel.  In this scenario 2,000 lbs. of chlorine was assumed to have been released as a gas within a ten-minute period.  As with the worst-case scenario, the EPA's RMP-Comp model was used assuming a Rural topography setting.  The wind speed was assumed to be 6.7 miles/hour with a stability class of D, according to EPA guidelines.  This stability class assumes a slight to moderate potential for air mixing due to turbulence or other factors. The model determined the distance to the toxic endpoint (i.e., 0.0087 mg/L based on ERPG-2) to be 0.8-mile.  The population within this area is approximately 11 people, according to the 1990 census"
