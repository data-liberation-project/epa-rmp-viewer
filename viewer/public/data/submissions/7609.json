Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n    The management and employees of Riverview FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of\n    any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,\n     the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate\n     any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous\n     ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n     Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management \n     personnel and authorized contractors.\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 140000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\n    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank                \n     released  as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140000 pounds,\n     which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n     \n     The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/l for worst-case scenario is 2.7 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a\n      in a transfer hose.\n\n     The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/l for the alternative scenario is .4 miles.  This release has \n      the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable\n     state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety\n     Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous A"

Five year accident history.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the pasy five years that:\n\n      -   have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facililty; nor\n\n      -   to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in\n          place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n      The facilty has:\n\n       -  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n       -  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n          information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n        - a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OHSA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120,\n           including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to \n     assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for  \n     implementation at this time."
