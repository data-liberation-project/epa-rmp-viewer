The Kinder Morgan CO2 Extraction Plant, located near Snyder, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce CO2 and natural gas streams for sale or use.  The CO2 Plant has several regulated flammables (in the natural gas).  Propane is also held in storage for refrigeration processes.  The CO2 Plant also uses or processes one toxic chemical over the threshold.\r\n\r\nGeneral accident release prevention program/chemical specific prevention steps. The Kinder Morgan CO2 Extraction Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Kinder Morgan also provides a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes and chemical handling instructions.\r\n\r\nKinder Morgan CO2 Extraction Plant has had an excellent record of accident prevention over the last five years.  We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring.  \r\n\r\nEmergency response program, Kinder Morgan works very closely with the local emergency response authorities to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The overall emergency response program for the CO2 Extraction Plant is coordinated with the Snyder Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The coordination includes periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials.  The CO2 Extraction Plant has 24/7 communication with the appropriate LEPC offici"
