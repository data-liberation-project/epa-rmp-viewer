      "SummaryText": "PROCESS SUMMARY\nThe Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Harrisonburg facility operates a cold storage warehouse/ distribution facility and an ice manufacturing and storage plant. The 345,000 square foot facility utilizes approximately 90,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for the cold storage and ice manufacturing operations. \n\nThe facility has four individual ammonia refrigeration systems using a standard single or double loop (high-side/ low-side) closed-loop refrigeration design. One system operates the ice-manufacturing and storage process, and three are used in the cold-storage operations. The systems are contained in three separate buildings. \n\nEach system consists of multiple compressors, condensers, a high-pressure ammonia receiver and low-pressure ammonia vessels, and evaporative condensers. In addition, the ice house system includes icemakers and air-cooling vault evaporators, while the cold storage systems include numerous evaporators to provide flash-freeze and product storage refrigeration capacity. All of the system compressors have numerous protective controls including motor overload, high and low temperature and pressure, low oil pressure, high and low liquid level cutouts, and pressure relief valves on all equipment. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility\u00bfs program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include exhaust purge fans, pressure safety relief valves, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the"

Administrative controls are in place that limit the utilization of vessels to less than their intended capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM 3\nBased on the Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Harrisonburg facility\u00bfs ammonia inventory, location, and requirement to meet OSHA PSM standards, it has been determined the facility is subject to the Prevention Program 3 requirements. This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice Group corporate management and Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Harrisonburg management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Harrisonburg PSM/RM Program elements.

Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals. The plant managers are responsible for some program elements on the managerial level, and the individual plant engineers are responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. A safety coordinator has been assigned for the facility and monthly safety meetings are conducted with all employees to present safety topics and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Harrisonburg facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Harrisonburg facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Harrisonburg facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for each plant that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan.

The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\nThe Reddy Ice-CASSCO/Harrisonburg facility operates an ongoing program of facility preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations. On a corporate level, Reddy Ice is continuing to implement ammonia diffusion/neutralization system installation at all plants and supporting the installation of additional ammonia detection, alarm, ventilation, and safety systems at its larger facilities."
