Accordingly, the following synopsis describes\n the management system implemented to address both requirements.  A more in depth description of each program element\n may be found in the corresponding chapters of the Memphis Plant's PSM / RMP written program.\n\n1.4.1   Employee Participation\n\n Chemtura Memphis encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety and our accident prevention\n program.  Examples of employee participation including self-directed work teams assessing plant personal protective\n equipment requirements to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team and participation in monthly \n union-management meetings.Employees have access to all information created as part of the PMCaccident prevention program. \n Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program\n include but are not limited to participation in the safety committee; root cause accident investigation, management of\n change meetings, and process hazard analysis of plant processes.

Within this program, each new and altered process is systematically examined to\n identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n PMC primarily uses the \"What If\" analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

All catastrophic mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked\n until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n To ensure that the process controls and / or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design\n safety features, PMC Memphis periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic\n reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for covered processes and will be conducted at this frequency until the\n process is no longer operational.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once\n again, the team findings are ranked by severity and probability prior to forwarding to plant management for\n consideration. The final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.
