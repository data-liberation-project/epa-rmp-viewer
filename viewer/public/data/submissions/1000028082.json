      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nPinal Energy, LLC\r\n\r\nPinal Energy, LLC (Pinal) is a producing ethanol manufacturing facility. Arizona Grain is adjacent to the location where Pinal Energy exists. Arizona Grain supplies the corn utilized for ethanol production at Pinal.\r\n\r\nPinal Energy began production in August of 2007. Pinal Energy has undergone several reviews of their constructed procedures and various reports to obtain plant efficiency and remain compliant with all governmental regulations.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\r\n\r\nPinal is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and testing, safety and compliance audits, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility. \r\n\r\nPinal's policy has been to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  \r\n\r\nDENATURANT STORAGE: The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area that is separated from the plant. This containment area is equipped with seven foot walls and a fire suppression foam cannon system. The foam suppression system is also connected to and runs to the top of each tank. During an incident the cannon would externally coat the tanks, while the pipe connecting to each tank would flood the tank internally. A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire would be quickly extinguished. \r\n\r\nAMMONIA: An ammonia tank, sulfuric acid tank, urea tank, sodium hydroxide tank, gluco amylase tank, and an alpha amylase tank are all located in the same containment area. This containment area is separated by four foot walls. The ammonia and urea tank are located in the same containment"

      "SummaryText": "area and an overflow dike that is also contained by a four foot wall is also constructed. This containment area is also protected by a pressurized fire system that in the event of a fire would easily be extinguished via fire pumps with two and a half hours of water supply available. A release from one of these tanks would not be able to mitigate off-site, and a fire would be quickly extinguished. Pinal has an emergency response contact on-call and a Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP). The HMMP is coordinated by the Maricopa Fire department and includes written emergency response procedures. \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nThe Pinal Energy LLC ethanol plant is located near Maricopa, Pinal County, Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe facility currently operates 24 hours per day, 7 days a week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn. The regulated substances under the RMP program includes denaturant(gasoline) and 30% Ammonium Hydroxide, which is considered an extremely hazardous substance. Pinal has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be approximately 0.7 miles for the denaturant, and 4.1 miles for the ammonium hydroxide. \r\n\r\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\r\n\r\nAMMONIA: The worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all the contents from the Ammonia tank creating a liquid spill evaporation. The worst case distance to toxic endpoint is approximately 2.2 miles from the center of the plant. Two public receptors are located within this 2.2 mile radius. The main office of AZ Grain,is located approximately 600 feet away. Also, a cattle company,is located 800 feet southeast of the plant. \r\n\r\nDENATURANT: The worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all the contents from the denaturant tank and gasoline constituents in the denatured ethanol tanks (624,169 lbs of flammable mixture) creating a vapor cloud explosion. The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0."

      "SummaryText": "7 miles from the center of the plant. Two public receptors are located within this 0.7 mile radius. The main office of Arizona Grain. Also, a cattle company, is located about 800 feet southeast of the plant. \r\n\r\nAlthough the Pinal Energy LLC ethanol plant has numerous controls in place to prevent a flammable and toxic release to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measure were taken into account in evaluating the worst-case and alternative scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe facility qualifies for Program 2 for Denaturant and Ammonium Hydroxide since public receptors could be impacted by a worst-case release. The facility is not subject to OSHA's Program Safety management requirements that would trigger Program 3. \r\n\r\nDENATURANT: Since the facility qualifies for Program 2, an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was required for the flammable constituents of the denaturant. The ARS is the release of 624,169 pounds from just the denaturant tank that would create a vapor cloud explosion. The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the facility. Both public receptors would still be affected.\r\n\r\nAMMONIA: Since the facility qualifies for Program 2, an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was required for the flammable constituents of the Ammonium Hydroxide. The ARS is the release of 249,465 pounds from the ammonia tank that would be caused from a vessel leak. The ARS endpoint is approximately 2.2 miles from the center of the facility. Both public receptors would still be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nPinal Energy's ethanol facility is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite. There have been no accidents at this time. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nThe Pinal Facility has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a HMMP. \r\n\r\nPinal conducts regular employee training as part of facility activities. Employees are involved in on-th"
