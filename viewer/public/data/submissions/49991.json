Boron trifluoride is delivered to the site in tube trailers that consist of six tubes.  Upon delivery, each tube\tcontains 3500 pounds of BF3 gas at a pressure of 1800 psig.  From these tubes, The BF3 gas is directly piped into the production area.  Only one tube is opened or used at a time.\n\n\tWORST CASE\n\n\tUS EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance specifies that the worst case scenario for non-refrigerated toxic gases liquefied under pressure shall be considered the failure of the largest vessel in the process that could participate in a single incident leading to a release.  For this event, the Area of Concern (OCA), within which individuals outside the plant property are considered \"affected public receptors,\" is defined as the circular area with a radius extending from the release point at which the predicted atmospheric concentration of BF3 reaches a regulatory endpoint value \nof 28 mg/m3.  In 2005 Honeywell the BF3 supplier for Boron Products, specified 2.8 mg/m3, or 1ppm, a new ceiling for BF3 exposure.  \n\n\tBased upon tube design and general guidance provided by industry sources, Boron Products assumes that no more than one tube could realistically be involved in any plausible accident scenario.  OCA Guidance specifies that the worst-case release rate be calculated assuming that the entire vessel contents are lost within ten minutes.  On this basis, the maximum rate of BF3 release is 350 pounds per minute.  \n\n\tPrevious dispersion calculations utilized EPA Guidance Reference Tables to calculate toxic release endpoints.

Since then, the regulatory endpoint value has changed to 2.8\tmg/m3 and due to the change in tube size the new worst case release rate is 350 pounds per minute.  The Gaussian Dispersion Model was used to calculate endpoint distance for the new conditions.  Using the stability classes and dispersion parameters developed by Pasquill and \nGifford, an endpoint distance of 5.23 miles was calculated for a concentration of 2.8 mg/m3.  Since, the AOC extends beyond the facility property, offsite consequences were predicted.  \n\t\n\tRMP rules require consideration of at least one or more less severe but more likely alternative releases.  When modeling the consequences of such releases, less conservative assumptions are allowed than for the worst-case analysis.  The effect of active mitigation systems can also be considered.  One condition of RMP rules is that for the alternative scenario to be valid, it must result in off-site consequences.  Two scenarios were considered: a leak from a tube during the final stages of use and a leak sized to be the smallest possible with off-site consequences.  \n\n\tTUBE LEAK SCENARIO 1\n\n\tBF3 is assumed to be leaking from a tube on a parked trailer at 7.5 pounds per minute.  After ten minutes, the leak has stopped, resulting to a total release of 75 pounds.  This amount corresponds the amount of BF3 present when a tube is near-empty.  Using the Gaussian Dispersion Model for less conservative atmospheric conditions from the OCA Guidance, the endpoint distance is found to be 0.412 miles, or 2175 feet.  A concentration profile was generated plotting endpoint concentration against distance and is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.

Using data from the 2000 Census, 5586 people reside in the AOC area of 85.88 square miles (?*5.232).\n\n\tIn the alternative scenario, it is estimated that no more than four residents are located inside the AOC.

The effect of active mitigation systems can also be considered.  One condition of RMP rules is that for the alternative scenario to be valid, it must result in off-site consequences.  Two scenarios were considered: a leak from a tube during the final stages of use and a leak sized to be the smallest possible with off-site consequences.  \r\n\r\n\tTUBE LEAK SCENARIO 1\r\n\r\n\tBF3 is assumed to be leaking from a tube on a parked trailer at 7.5 pounds per minute.  After ten minutes, the leak has stopped, resulting to a total release of 75 pounds.  This amount corresponds the amount of BF3 present when a tube is near-empty.  Using the Gaussian Dispersion Model for less conservative atmospheric conditions from the OCA Guidance, the endpoint distance is found to be 0.412 miles, or 2175 feet.  A concentration profile was generated plotting endpoint concentration against distance and is shown in Figure 1.\r\n\r\nFigure 1.  BF3 Concentration vs. Distance\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tTUBE LEAK SCENARIO 2\r\n\r\n\tUnder this scenario, the Gaussian Dispersion Model is applied in order to determine the maximum ten minute release rate in which an endpoint value of 2.8 mg/m3 would be reached \tinside facility boundaries.  Setting the endpoint distance at the nearest property line distance of 885 feet yields a maximum release rate of 1.64 pounds per minute.  Setting the endpoint distance at the nearest residence distance of 1320 feet yields a maximum release rate of 3.28 pounds per \tminute. A graph was generated plotting release rate against distance and is shown in Figure 2.\r\n\r\nFigure 2.  BF3 Release Rate vs. Distance\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRMP rules require identification of the type of public receptors (schools, parks, offsite \tcommercial developments, etc.) and estimation of affected populations residing within the AOC based upon census data or other means.

The 0.412 mile endpoint for the alternative scenario does not reach any nearby towns or cities.  \r\n\r\n\tRMP rules also require the identification of environmental receptors (national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges).  Review of the site map reveals that there are no such environmental receptors in the AOC under any release scenario considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tRELEASE PROTECTION\r\n\r\n\tThe boron trifluoride process area has been regulated by OSHA's Process Management (PSM) since 1994.  The facility has successfully implemented all fourteen elements of the PSM program for the covered process. \r\n\tThe facility has developed written operating and safety procedures for every facet of the covered\tprocess from delivery of the boron trifluoride tube trailer through the production of boron isotopes.  \r\n\tEmployees working in the covered process are retrained every three years in the operating procedures as required by the PSM standard.\r\n\tThe covered process is routinely reviewed by the operating staff.  A process hazard analysis must be performed every five years and in the event of a specific process modification in order to identify process concerns and develop solutions for them.  In addition, all fourteen elements of the PSM program are reviewed every three years to ensure the program is in compliance with all OSHA PSM requirements.\r\n\tIn the covered process, the Boron Department has eight operators that are trained under the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) 40-hour operations level.\r\n\tThis program requires that operators be trained in the hazardous chemical awareness and emergency response procedures. These individuals are trained to respond to hazardous chemical releases and to implement proper responses to minimize a"

All HAZWOPER operators receive an annual eight-hour refresher course to maintain their certification.\r\n\r\n\tPractices at the Boron facility to prevent chemical releases include a preventative maintenance\tprogram over covered process equipment and hourly process inspections to insure there are no equipment leaks and equipment is functioning properly.  In addition, the covered process is \tmonitored through process sensors and alarms on a continuous basis to alert operators of any process disruptions so that they can immediately be abated.  These same sensors can also automatically shut the operation down as well with minimal impact on the environment.\r\n\r\n\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\n\tThere have been no accidents at this facility in the past five years involving boron \ttrifluoride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\tBoron Products implements a 24-hour walk-about procedure in which every hour, employees check the process for leaks and other problems.  If a problem is found, employees will notify proper personnel and take necessary precautionary measures.  If warranted, Boron Products will notify the local fire department and request assistance.  \r\n\tIn the worst case scenario involving a BF3 release from a tube trailer, the Boron Products has trained personnel in the prevention and mitigation of a boron trifluoride leak. Operators have been trained by the supplier specifically on how to address leaks from the tube trailer. Trained personnel have the necessary personal protective equipment and replacement parts necessary to address any process leaks described in the alternative release scenario.  \r\n\tIn the event of a release that may potentially affect offsite areas, Boron Products personnel will notify the proper local authorities as outlined in our Emergency Response Plan to inform them of the situation and advise accordingly.  Boron Products officials have met with local officials and outlined a course of action fo"
