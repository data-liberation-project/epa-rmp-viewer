The Utility's program provides all information necessary to properly manage the regulated chemical - Chlorine gas.  Plant personnel are trained in the safe handling and use of chlorine and are provided with the necessary safety equipment for working in proximity with this subtstance.  It is the Utility's policy to utilize the City of Pompano Beach Fire Depatments's HAZMAT team to respond to all major emegency conditions.  The Water Treatment Plant is a 50 MGD (10 membrane, 40 lime softening) facility which serves the City of Pompano Beach service area.  The plant utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection of the potable water prior to distribution.  The maximum quantity of chlorine store on-site is 32,000 lbs. in the form of (16) one-ton cylinders.  The Water Treatment Plant complies with all requirements stipulated in EPA 40 CFR Part 68 \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Program\" and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\"  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine, uncontrolled reactions, or runaway reactions in the past five years.  The Utilities Department will continue it's ongoing safety training and maintenance programs to ensure proper operations at the facility.  The Utilities Department is also in the process of converting its disinfection chemical from chlorine gas to hypochlorite."
