We will provide a safe and productive workplace for our employees, conduct our operations in an environmentally responsible manner, comply with applicable laws and regulations and improve the communities where we live and work. We recognize that operating excellence does not just happen, and that we need to have management tools in place to organize and sustain the effort. Achieving excellence in our operations is the responsibility of every employee.  Operations line management must ensure the development and implementation of procedures which guide employee actions as appropriate.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training, engineering controls in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent accidental and uncontrolled releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant is located in Andrews County, Texas 35 miles southwest of Andrews. The boundaries of the stationary source are defined by the external fence surrounding the facility. The plant's cryogenic unit processes a dry residue gas from accumulated casing head gas production to produce Natural Gas Liquids, or NGLs. Methane, Ethane, Propane, n-butane, i-butane, n-pentane and i-pentane are regulated flammable hydrocarbons contained in the NGLs. Also, the plant uses refrigerant grade propane for refrigeration purposes. The Dollarhide Gas Plant does not use and/or process any regulated toxic substances above threshold quantities.\n\n                   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nDollarhide Gas Plant is a RMP Program 1 facility.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained in the Process Safety SharePoint of the facility and which addresses each accidental release prevention program element.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI):\n\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within Scout are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. An electronic library or system of records for the reference documents is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response, PPE requirements and exposure treatment considerations are provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) as part of the HAZCOM program.

The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant conducts process hazard analysis to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this studies, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Dolarhide Gas Plant uses the HazOpS and LOPA methodologies on these studies. The studies are conducted using a team of people that will be knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology used. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures are used as operating references by operations personnel and serve as training procedures for new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the MOC process. In addition, the Dollarhide Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter in the DCS System that provides alarm notification for excess process control deviations. This information, along with written operating procedures is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Dollarhide Gas Plant maintains Safe Operating Limits/Consequences of Deviation tables that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

The action plan addresses proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant process or a change in personnel responsibilities.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Dollarhide Gas Plant is coordinated with the local Emergency Agencies located in the adjacent communities. This coordination includes periodic updates to the local emergency response officials.  The Dollarhide Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. The Dollarhide Gas Plant conducts a table top or physical emergency drill on an Annual basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe primary vehicle for the continued development of a comprehensive safety program at the Dollarhide Plant is the implementation of Socut saftey and PSM programs.  Under the direction of the these programs, where applicable new technology, equipment and practices will be utilized to eliminate, control or mitigate site specific risk exposures to affected personnel, the public and the environment. As an example, the Dollarhide Gas Plant has recently made changes to the process to reduce the inventory of flammable hydrocarbons by isolating from the process and decommissioning the off-spec NGL tanks, which contributes to reduce risk.\n\n"
