A railcar holds 180,000 pounds of liquid ethylene oxide. The evaporating ethylene oxide could potentially reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  The site has implemented a process safety management system, including railcar inspection, security, physical barriers and unloading procedures intended to prevent this type of incident from occurring.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Ethylene Oxide\n\n\n\nOne RMP alternative release scenario involves the rupture of an ethylene oxide piping connection, resulting in the release of approximately 15,930 pounds of ethylene oxide over a period of 45 minutes.   Our on-site emergency response team would use automatic and manually operated valves to stop such a release.  Per the EPA's off-site consequence analysis software, ethylene oxide released in this scenario could impact public receptors within 0.6 miles of the facility.  The public receptors that could be impacted by such a release are nearby residences. The site has implemented a process safety management program that includes inspection and scheduled replacement of piping connectors to prevent this type of scenario from occurring.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Propylene Oxide\n\n\n\nOur last alternative release scenario involves the rupture of a propylene oxide piping connection, resulting in the release of approximately 15,400 pounds of propylene oxide over a period of 45 minutes.   Our on-site emergency response team would use automatic and manually operated valves to stop such a release.  Per the EPA's off-site consequence analysis software, propylene oxide released in this scenario could impact public receptors within 0.18 miles of the facility.

However, we have a system in place to investigate and keep records of significant incidents, including accidental chemical releases that might occur at our site.  If a significant release should occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\n\n\n\nWe also gather information on other significant incidents at other facilities, and implement changes if necessary in our facility to prevent incidents.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Planning:\n\n\n\nWe maintain emergency response plans, which address all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Our plan also includes specific procedures for responding to a release of RMP chemicals.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Gaston and Mecklenburg County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Emergency response drills have also been conducted with the local emergency response organizations. \n\n\n\nTwenty Seven Clariant Mt.
