The Facility Policy\n\n    The owners, Management, and employees of LaPorte Co. Co-op, Union Mills Branch are committed \n    to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should\n    occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any\n    release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n   - This facility receives & stores grain from farmers and stores and blends fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n   - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production  \n     nutrients. \n   - The maximum quantity stored would be 1,100,000 pounds in the storage tank, rail cars and nurse tanks.\n     The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail car holding 160,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.  Accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The Facility is in compiance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),\n     29CFR190.11, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and the State of Indiana code 355IAC.\n     The OSHA standard is refrenced in this RMP registration form, see section 8.3(b).        \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\n   a.
