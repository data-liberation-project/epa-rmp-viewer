The Facility Policy\n\n    The owners, Management, and employees of LaPorte Co. Co-op, Union Mills Branch are committed \n    to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should\n    occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any\n    release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n   - This facility receives & stores grain from farmers and stores and blends fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n   - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production  \n     nutrients. \n   - The maximum quantity stored would be 1,100,000 pounds in the storage tank, rail cars and nurse tanks.\n     The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail car holding 160,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.  Accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The Facility is in compiance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),\n     29CFR190.11, \"storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and the State of Indiana code 355IAC.\n     The OSHA standard is refrenced in this RMP registration form, see section 8.3(b).        \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\n   a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n   - Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge,  \n     have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or  \n     environmental damage.\n\n5. The emergency action  program.\n\n   a. The facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.\n       This is the hazardous material plan developed and maintained by our Local Emergency Planning\n       Committee (LEPC).\n\n   b.

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to\n       evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n       1. Within 15 minutes of determing that the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the\n           Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\n               The National Emergency Response Center @ 800-424-8802\n\n       2.

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to  \n    assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia  \n    safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
