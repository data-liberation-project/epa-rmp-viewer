These safeguards include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of the regulated substances, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous) and/or chlorine gas.\r\n \r\n1.4 Five-year accident history:\r\nIn the last five years, there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of regulates substances that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n1.5 The emergency action program:\r\nRinchem has developed an emergency action program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of chemicals to employees, the community, and the environment. Rinchem management has opted to contract emergency response for releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup. All facility employees have been trained to identify the need for an initiated emergency response. The facility Emergency Action Program consists of: Emergency Action Plan, Environmental Safety Health Reporting Procedure and Emergency Evacuation Plan. The Emergency Action Program contains the specific procedures and instructions for employees to take in the event of an accidental chemical release, fire, natural disasters or other emergencies that may arise. The program also contains the names and contact numbers of responding outside agencies. The Emergency Action Program and associated documents are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes that may occur to content and structure of the plan.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned changes to improve safety:\r\nThe facility evaluates, resolves, and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews, audits, process hazard analyses, and incident inves"

The delivery vehicles are unloaded, the containers stored and then delivered to the final user. Rinchem Company, manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices(e.g. alarms, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the facility.\r\n\r\nThe written Rinchem emergency action plans include procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by the local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis summary has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\r\n\r\n1.2 The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and redelivery of a variety of compressed gases and chemicals to the end user. The Hydrogen Chloride (anhydrous) and chlorine gas cylinders are the regulated substances that are handled in quantities that exceed the EPA thresholds for regulated substances.\r\n\r\n1.3 The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\r\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.
