This stationary source is on approximately 150 acres of land in an agricultural area located on the southern edge of Mason City, Iowa.  The facility is in operation 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Considered a single stationary source with NAICS code 325193 (Ethyl Alcohol Manufacturing), GGE is subject to Section 112(r) of Clean Air Act and has developed a risk management program due to on-site storage of natural gasoline (denaturant).  Denaturant is a flammable mixture and, when it has an NFPA Rating of 4, is subject to RMP if greater than 10,000 pounds is stored on-site.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION TIPS\r\nAs a result of proximity to public receptors, GGE is not eligible for Program 1.  Also, GGE is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Therefore, GGE follows Program 3 requirements for the Risk Management Program.  The fundamentals of GGE's Risk Management Program are met through the Process Safety Management (PSM) program that is active at GGE.  GGE implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of denaturant and other hazardous substances.  In order to avoid risk associated with duplicate expectations related to safety and accidental releases, the PSM is where details of GGE's program are maintained.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nGGE has not experienced an accidental release from the denaturing process that resulted in 1) deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or 2) known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nIn the event a release o"

If additional assistance is deemed necessary to minimize onsite impact, the Mason City Fire Department will be called.  If off-site impact is possible, Cerro Gordo County Emergency Management will also be notified.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nGGE trains employees on potential hazards and safe operation of the denaturing process to increase safety awareness.  GGE will continue to make improvements as identified by employees, visitors, and contractors."
