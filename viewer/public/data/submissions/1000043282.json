A combination of accidental release prevention and emergency action planning will be used to protect the environment and to ensure the safety of the employees as well as the citizens of the surrounding communities.\n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Synergy Liquids will implement, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of the facility and the substances regulated by 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 that are currently handled on-site in stationary sources above their corresponding threshold quantities;\n\n- An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\n\n- A five-year accident history for significant accidental releases from processes covered by EPA's RMP rule;\n\n- An overview of the emergency response programs; and\n\n- An overview of improvements at the facility implemented to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting the employees, the public, the environment, and company assets.\n\n\n\n1.2 ?68.155(b): Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSynergy Liquids has executed an agreement to utilize the existing rail spur at the Trimac Tulsa Transloading Facility in 2120 N 161st E Ave, Tulsa, Oklahoma.  The proposed operations will include the transloading of RGB and RGP from railcars to tanker trucks or vice versa.

Synergy Liquids has developed a written procedure that lists the conditions and guidelines for safely transloading RGB and RGP from a rail car to a tank truck or vice versa.  This procedure will be followed by the third-party carrier who actually performs the transloading on behalf of Synergy Liquids.  \n\n\n\nBoth RGB and RGP are liquefied flammable gases transported under pressure.  All ignition sources in the vicinity of the transloading operations will be eliminated prior to executing the transloading procedure. \n\n\n\n1.4 ?68.155(d): Five-Year Accident History\n\nOperation of the Trimac Tulsa Transloading Facility will begin in 2014; therefore, there have been no accidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.5 ?68.155(e): Emergency Response Program\n\nSynergy Liquids has coordinated emergency response activities with the Tulsa Fire Department.
