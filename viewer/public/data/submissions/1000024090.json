              "Description": "The Plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidentalreleases on NH3. Employees working at the storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the NH3 from the storage vessels to the nurse tanks. In doing so, they are able to detect potential problems prior to them occurring. This routine inspection identifies any external portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with NH3 including the storage and handling of NH3. In addition to annual training for long term employees, the company conducts new hire training which includes hazard material training via classroom instruction, onsite training at the plant, and follow up observation to determine comprehension of training. The company has certain employee(s) participating in annual HazWoper training and invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that local fire department requests assistance in training its employees/volunteers on NH3, the company cooperates fully.",

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Mahaska and Marion County Emergency Management Agencies as Tracy is located near the border of both counties. A 911 call would be made to both organizations. Incidental to the notification to the  County EMAs, a call to Marion and Mahaska County LEPA will be made.\n\n\n\nTwo Rivers has planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different than the scenarios anticipated and cannot be ensured to duplicate the defined plan. In reality, the situation that develops may not occur in the manner planned or assumed, in that instance, the plan will be utilized as a guideline.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action plan (EAP) developed for the facility describes procedures that are intended to minimize hazards associated with human health and environment from fires, explosions, sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (NH3), tornadoes, bomb threats, theft, or other accidents and acts of natures that may occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Tracy, Iowa location is Nick Steinbach, Safety Coordinator. Nick Steinbach's  work and 24-hour contact information are provided in the registration section of this document.

The NH3 that is stored at the facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the product for crop nutrient purposes.\n\n\n\nThe system consists of one (1) large storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pumps and other miscellaneous equipment. Throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at the site. The NH3 plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full time equivalent employees were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three (3) months. The FTE for the location is two (2).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst scenario is the failure of one storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting n the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According the EPA eRMP Program the distance to endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the hoses. The resulting release, according  to the EPA's eRMP Program has a distance end point of 0.5 miles.\n\n\n\nThe system shut off is protected by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut off valves, and emergency shut off valves. The load out risers used in filling nurse tanks area protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are to be locked when not in use.\n\n\n\nAs the facility is located in relatively close proximity of the town of Tracy, IA and the Red Rock Reservoir, provisions have been designed to affected persons and an evacuation plan is in place in case of major incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule"

In the unlikely event the Tracy Volunteer Department in unable to adequately respond to an emergency, the Pella Fire Department will be summoned due to a reciprocal agreement with Tracy.
