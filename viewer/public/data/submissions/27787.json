In April, 2001 we assumed control of our plant in Claiborne, AL (Formerly Claiborne Energy). This plant was orginally designed to fractionate liquefied petroleum gas. The fractionating portion has since been shut down, and all related items to that portion of the plant have been purged and sealed off. This plant was built according to all Federal, State and local requirements, and in strict compliance with all applicable NFPA standards. All the requirements of NFPA 58 to control accidental release were built into this plant and we have always strived to keep up with changing regulations for the products that we handle, and also any new safety devices that help insure that we do not have a chemical release.\n\nTechnical Propellants, Inc. takes a very responsible attitude toward safety! Proper emergency planning and response are important elements of any safety and health program to help minimize employee, public, and environmental concerns. This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintainence, and employee training. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Mexia Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the envrionment.\n\nWe are a manufacturer of aerosol propellants. We recieve raw LPG; ie-Propane, Isobutane, and Butane, into our plant by tank trucks. We process this material through molecular sieves to take out  impurities, it is then stored in tanks awaiting  shipment. Per our customers specifications, we load these materials by themselves, or blend them together into our tank trailers for shipment.\n\nOur worst case"

      "FacilityID": 27787,
      "SummaryText": " release scenario would be the release of Butane from the storage tank which can hold a maximum of 130,000 pounds. According to EPA guidelines for figuring worst case release, it has to be assumed that the entire contents of the tank would be released and that all safety valves would fail and none of the manual valves could be closed. Also, the weather condition would be such that none of the gas would dissapate into the atmosphere. If these conditions were to ever happen, using EPA RMP Comp. Version 1.06, the estimated distance to the endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion would be 0.4 miles from the storage tank, and would have an offsite impact.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is one that would be the most likely to happen. This would be the rupture of a transfer hose. This scenario is also figured to EPA guideline that all safety valves would fail and the release would last five minutes before an operator could shut off the flow of product. In this case, using EPA RMP Comp. Version 1.06, the estimated distance to the endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion would be 0.05 miles, this would cause minimal, if any, offsite impact.\n\nTechnical  Propellants, Inc. complies with regulations such as OSHA, PSM and NFPA 58 which have guidelines for mandatory safety equipment that has been installed in this facility to avoid any accidental release. We have always, and will continue to keep up with any new and improved measures that will help us maintain the highest standards possible to insure safety.\n\nThere has been no accidental release of regulated or other chemicals at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nTechnical Propellants, Inc. has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standards. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response, including employee training, evacuation routes, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at our plant will include the updating of any new or improved safety and miti"
