      "SummaryText": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC) is an advanced semiconductor facility on an approximate 1,000 acre parcel near the City of Phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona. The facility will utilize TSMC\u0092s 5 nanometer technology for semiconductor wafer fabrication. \n\nThe facility includes one Fab building where semiconductor chips will be manufactured and buildings containing support equipment, including natural gas fired boilers, diesel fired emergency generators, fire pump engines, and cooling towers. Supporting equipment will reside in the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), Chemical Storage (LORRY), Bulk Specialty Gas System (BSGS), and Central Utility Plant (CUP) buildings. \n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC AZ)  uses 29% ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) as part of its wafer manufacturing process.  The chemistry is offloaded by truck and stored in tanks.  The chemistry is then transferred by pipeline to the manufacturing processes.  Waste from the process is then neutralized and processed.\n\nOn September 19 -21, 2022, a Hazard and Operability Study (HazOp) was conducted by Jensen Hughes Engineering Consultants.    Jensen Hughes also provided the results of the Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA).  As part of our ongoing process improvement plan, TSMC AZ will continually look for solutions to make our system as safe as practical by reviewing incidents and implementing best practices. \n\n29% NH4OH storage tanks operate in a fully enclosed building.  Spill containment measures include secondary containments, dikes, and drainage systems to minimize community impacts.  Spill containments are equipped with leak detectors and gas monitoring systems which reports to operators through our SCADA system.\n\nTsmc is a startup facility and does not have a history of incidents.  Our sister site in Taiwan does not have a history of releases.  \n\nOur internal emergency response team has trained on likely scenarios should an event occur.  Our internal team has als"
