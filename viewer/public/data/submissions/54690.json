      "SummaryText": "The Susquehanna Water Treatment Plant (SWTP) is one of two water treatment plants owned and operated by the City of Lancaster Pennsylvania, Bureau of Water.  The SWTP is located at 900 South 15th Street, Columbia Pennsylvania.  The SWTP uses chlorine in one-ton containers for disinfecting the drinking water it produces.  The facility stores up to 24,000 pounds of chlorine which exceeds the threshold limit (2,500 lbs.) of the EPA 40 CFR ?68 Risk Management Program (RMProgram) Rule.  This facility is a Program 2 facility of the RMProgram because of the amount of chlorine stored on site.\nThe RMProgram is made up of four parts; Part I Hazard Assessment, Part II  Prevention Program, Part III Emergency Response Program, and Part IV Risk Management Plan.\nHazard Assessment:\nThe Hazard Assessment describes a worst-case release, an alternative release, and the five-year release history of chlorine.  \nThe RMProgram  mandates that a worst-case release be the release of the entire contents of one container in a ten minute period.  The maximum release for this facility would be 2000 pounds (one one-ton container) or a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  If this release occurred, the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L would be 1.3 miles.  This release would have an offsite impact.  The distance to toxic endpoint was determined using the EPA RMP*COMP gas dispersion modeling program.  \nThe EPA RMProgram Rule also mandates that an alternative release is one that is more likely to happen.  The alterative release considered for this facility is a release through a 5/16 inch valve body.  This opening could be from a broken line or valve.  The maximum release for this scenario would be 630 pounds for 60 minutes or 10.5 pounds per minute.  The distance to toxic endpoint would be 0.1 miles using the RMP*COMP modeling program.  This release would have a slight offsite impact.\nThe impact areas of the worst-case and alternative releases are reduced through the use of passive mi"

The passive mitigation includes container inspection before delivery acceptance, operating and maintenance procedures and training, enclosed building containment, emergency response awareness level training, and emergency response coordination with LEMA.  In addition chlorine containers are inspected daily for defects.  \nThe EPA RMProgram Rule mandates that a five-year accident history be recorded.  The SWTP has not had a reportable quantity release in the last five years.\nPrevention Program\nThe Prevention Program is made up of eight sections that describe the management, safety, hazards, operations, maintenance, and training programs.  It also includes the compliance audit and incident investigation procedure.  In complying with the RMProgram the SWTP has developed safety, operating, maintenance, and training procedures that will enhance the prevention of a chlorine release.  The enactment of this program has cause changes to the chlorine system to protect the system and make it safer to operate.  These changes include adding barriers to protect stored containers from vehicle impact, storing containers with valves in the 6/12 o?clock position, labeling all valves, piping, and equipment, and installing piping with consistent slope and no low areas.  \nEmergency Response Program\nThe Emergency Response Program is the current Off-Site Response Plan developed by the Lancaster County Emergency Management Agency for the SWTP.  This plan was developed in accordance with the provisions of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) Title III, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the Hazardous Material Emergency Planning and Response Act, Pennsylvania Act 1990-165.  This plan was originally approved by the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Lancaster County on January 11, 1990.  \nThe Bureau of Waters training and policy for a reportable quantity chemical release instruc"

LEMA is the designated responder for a chlorine leak.  The policy also includes evacuation procedures if necessary. \nRisk Management Plan\nThe RMPlan is a summary of the RMProgram that is submitted electronically to the EPA using the EPA RMP*SUBMIT program.  The information will be available on the Internet through the EPA RMP*INFO web page.  \nChemical Safety and Accidental Release Prevention\nThe overall approach to chemical safety and accidental release prevention at this facility is based on education, training, and practice of safe operating and maintenance procedures.  The SWTP management is committed to safety and implementation of safe procedures.  Employees are trained annually in safety procedures, safe operations of chemical equipment, and emergency response procedures.  The training includes classroom, hands-on training, and emergency response awareness level training.  All employees are certified competent through a proficiency examination before being allowed to operate chemical equipment. \n \nThe existing conventional filters are expected to be replaced with a membrane filtration system.  As part of this treatment plant upgrade, sodium hypochlorite will replace chlorine gas for disinfection.  The upgrades are projected to be completed by 2010.\nThe Bureau of Water is always looking for cost effective technology that will improve the safety of the chlorine system or replace the dependance on chlorine.  The SWTP will continue to operate the chlorine system as safely as possible, always keeping the safety of the public, employees, and water supply in mind."
