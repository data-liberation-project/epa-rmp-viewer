              "Description": "The Americold Logistics, LLC Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety\n\nManagement Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems. The first element in the safe\n\nfunction of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself. All components in the\n\nsystem were designed and installed in compliance with ANSI, ASHRAE, ASME, Pressure\n\nVessel Codes and all other applicable design safety standards in effect at the time of\n\nconstruction. \n\n\n\nIn order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of\n\ntime, it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional\n\nefficiency. Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe\n\nprocedures when operating the equipment from normal start-up to running and emergency\n\nshut-down. Also built into the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and\n\nmaintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to\n\nrespond early to operational deviations before they become emergencies.\n\n\n\nOperator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency\n\nresponse procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protection\n\nequipment in an emergency scenario. The hazard analysis (\"what-if\") checklist helps\n\noperators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an\n\nemergency situation safety and effectively in order to mitigate the potential releases. Lockout/\n\ntag-out, and line opening procedures are very important for preventing further hazards\n\naround malfunctioning equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system.\n\n\n\nGeneral employee training involves a knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning systems and\n\nevacuation procedures. Coordinated emergency response planning is established with\n\nMontgomery County LEPC, and a written offsite emergency response plan is reviewed\n\nannually.\n\n",
