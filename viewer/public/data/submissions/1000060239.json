Using these distances, the receptor data (including sensitive, environmental, and public receptors) were collected in addition to the population data within these zones.

These forms include physical as well as operational data for each piece of ammonia refrigeration equipment. \r\n\r\nOn 4/7/2015 a review of the prevention programs was conducted.  This review commenced with the Process Safety Information (PSI) to determine whether there has been any new equipment added or removed from the facility since the most recent revision of the document.

Finally, the remainders of the prevention programs were reviewed with the Facility Services Manager to analyze the effectiveness of each program."
