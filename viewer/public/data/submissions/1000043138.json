If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7\tThe activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\r\nA\u00b7\t Anhydrous ammonia is used in the production of this product. \r\n.       The maximum quantity stored would be 65663 pounds in our 15,000 gallon storage tank.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 65663 pounds is rounded to 66000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\r\n\r\na.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 65663 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 65663 pounds is rounded to 66000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.8 miles.\r\n\r\nb.\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program:\r\n\r\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1A\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminis"
