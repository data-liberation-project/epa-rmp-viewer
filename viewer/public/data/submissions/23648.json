EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe ISP Calvert City Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Calvert City Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council (formerly Chemical Manufacturers Association) and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care( to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Calvert City Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at ISP's Calvert City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Calvert City Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of that Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n1.1\t\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe ISP Calvert City Plant is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, contacts the local Mutual Aid Association, Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP"

Calvert Industry, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department have also established a system for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\r\n\r\nISP's Site General Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program for EPA-regulated processes at their respective facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on an organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM), accident prevention program, RMP hazard assessment and Risk Management Plan has been delegated jointly to the Environmental Manager, Safety Manager, and Senior Safety/PSM Coordinator.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\n1.2\t\tISP's Calvert City Plant Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe ISP Calvert City Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located in the Purchase Area of far western Kentucky, in Calvert City, in northern Marshall County.  The Plant is the largest industrial employer (approximately 520 site employees), in Marshall County.  We use the following chemicals as our feed materials: acetylene, ammonia, toluene, benzene, acetone, ethanol, butanediol, vinyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, iodine, styrene, methanol, propane, cyclohexylamine, ethylamine, cyclohexane, and ethyl acetate. The ISP Calvert City Plant makes a variety of products:  Butyrolactone, 2-pyrrolidone, Vinyl Pyrrolidone, Poly Vinyl Pyrrolidones, Gantrez, Vinyl Ethers, Stabileze, Various Pharmaceutical Int"

Some of these feed materials and products are toxic or flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the specified EPA threshold quantity.  In total, we have 12 processes that are covered by the RMP rule. The following are the RMP substances we handle in covered processes:  Acetylene, Propane, Vinyl Acetate, Cyclohexylamine, Vinyl Methyl Ether, Ammonia, Ethyl Vinyl Ether, and Ethylamine.\r\n\r\n1.3  Off-site Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Calvert City Plant performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  ISP does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the ISP Plant.  Alternative release scenarios can be used to help improve the community emergency response plan.  We have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to local residents and businesses.  Additional information can be obtained by calling the Environmental or Safety Departments at (270) 395-4165.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tWhen considering explosion of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are likely to be knocked down by the blast, windows could shatter, and the potential for structural damage to buildings exists, although a building collapse is unlikely.

In addition, the Calvert City Plant has a number of initiatives under way that addresses process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\n1.4.2\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Calvert City Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team recommendations are reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. \r\n\r\n1.4.4\tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Calvert City Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\n1.4.5\tTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, ISP has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or facilities. \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Plant is coordinated with the Marshall County local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in periodic LEPC meetings, the ISP Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant. \r\n\r\n1.8   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nISP's Calvert City Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting suggestions from the workers.
