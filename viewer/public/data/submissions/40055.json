Our continuing work to prevent accidents and releases from occurring, as well as our preparations to respond to incidents should they occur, help to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This summary provides an overview of the risk management activities at the Croydon Plant, and a discussion of our response to the EPA?s Risk Management Program.

The plant was built in 1969 and is part of a larger site, the Bristol Facility originally built in 1909.  Today, the Bristol Facility includes a polymers production facility, digital imaging facility, and corporate engineering group.  The Croydon Plant shares many of the services provided at the Bristol Facility including a unified emergency response network.  Of the total site area of 800+ acres, only 250 acres are in actual usage with the balance of the area utilized as open space accommodating a variety of plant and animal species.\n\nThe Croydon Plant produces over 100 different products which are sold to other manufacturers who use them as key components in consumer products.  The Croydon Plant produces emulsion products which are used as  coatings and binders.  Emulsion coating products are used in interior and exterior latex paint and traffic line formulations.  In addition, these products ar"

The Croydon Plant produces environmentally friendly coating products.\n\nCroydon Plant produces more than 300 million pounds of product annually, and employs 149 personnel.  The plant works with the Bristol Facility contributing to a variety of charitable organizations within the community.   The Bristol Facility works closely with its Community Advisory Council (CAC) to identify the needs and community concerns.\n\n3.0    The EPA?s Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, and updated in 2004, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under the Clean Air Act containing a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical are subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate ?worst case? and ?alternate case? scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to the public.  This document is part of Rohm and Haas Croydon Plant?s RMP communication effort.  \n\n4.0    Regulated Substances\n\nThe Croydon Plant uses three RMP toxic chemicals: \n?    Acrylonitrile monomer\n?    Vinyl Acetate monomer\n?    Aqueous ammonia. \n\n\n5.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy       \n\nRohm and Haas Croydon Plant has a long standing commitment to provide a safe workplace and to prevent accidental releases.  This commitment is set forth in Rohm and Haas environmental, health and safety policies:\n\n?    We will meet or exceed all applicable laws and regulations, participate in voluntary initiatives such as Responsible Care? and strive"

We will ensure our worldwide operations and products are free from significant risks to the health and safety of our employees, customers, carriers, distributors, the general public, and to the environment.\n    \n?    We will communicate, listen and be responsive to our employees, customers, neighbors, and governments, and strive to eliminate or reduce emissions, discharges, and wastes from every stage of our operations.\n\n?    We will provide our employees with a safe workplace and support their efforts to work safely.\n\n?    We will strive to eliminate or reduce emissions, discharges, and waste from every stage of our operations.\n\nThe types of risk management programs required by the RMP have long been in place at the Croydon Plant.  Safe operation is a plant and company priority, and is reflected in policies as well as everyday activities. \n\n6.0    The Rohm and Haas Croydon Plant Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps  \n\nCroydon Plant maintains a number of accident prevention programs in order to ensure safe operation of all processes.  The Croydon Plant complies with OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, which is nearly identical to EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. Additionally, the Plant follows corporate and plant-specific safety standards, (which in some cases are more stringent than the OSHA general safety standards), while also complying with EPA, DOT, and state requirements.  The Croydon Plant also participates in OSHA?s Voluntary Protection Program which focuses on continued workplace safety practices.  The following items are part of our ongoing program to prevent releases and incidents for RMP toxic chemicals as well as any other chemicals:  \n\n6.1     Employee Participation ?  Employees are involved in many activities to continuously improve plant safety.   Employees participate in safety committees, job safety analysis, audits, design and pre-star"

Corrective action plans are developed and implemented as part of the analyses and updated a minimum of every five years.  Safety systems are designed into the processes.  These are designed to create several layers of protection, so that if one system fails other systems will maintain the process in a safe state.  These engineering and administrative controls help prevent releases of chemicals: \n\n?    Redundant safety systems and instrumentation, particularly for tank level systems\n?    Automatic shutdown devices that are triggered if critical safety equipment malfunctions\n?    Secondary containment for storage tanks\n?    Alarm systems and automatic shutdown devices for critical control parameters \n?    Pressure relief devices to prevent over pressurization\n?    Fire protection systems\n?    Operator attendance of unloading operations\n?    Permit system to control work in hazardous areas\n?    Work preplanning and safety reviews\n\n\n6.3    Operating Procedures ? Operating procedures have been developed for all processes to insure safe operation.  Employees that operate the manufacturing process are included in the development, training, and periodic review of these procedures.   Our processes are ISO ? 9000 certified. \n\n6.4    Employee Training ? Training programs have been developed and implemented  to ensure that all affected employees understand the hazards of the chemicals used and the required safe handling procedures. Employees involved in operating the manufacturing processes are trained, tested, qualified and certified at least once every 3 years as required by OSHA PSM.      \n  \n6.5    Mechanical Integrity ?
