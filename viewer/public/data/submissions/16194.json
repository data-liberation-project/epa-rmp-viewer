Tioga Gas Plant identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of the Wilfred Baker Engineering Company of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow methodology for determining the RMP designated 1-psi overpressure contour.  According to the analyses, the greatest maximum end point for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 700 feet from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained in the Butane storage bullet when filled to the greatest amount allowed (274,429 pounds).  This worst-case release would not affect any public or environmental receptor beyond property owned and occupied by Tioga Gas Plant. \n\n\nWithin the past five years, Tioga Gas Plant has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the executive summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.  \n\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the informa"

The plant has several regulated flammables, such as Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, and Natural Gas Condensate.  In addition, the plant produces and contains as by-products of processing, Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) at levels below the listed RMP threshold quantities.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcesses at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The Tioga Gas Plant adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years, the Tioga Gas Plant has had no accidental release that caused off site impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  Within the past 5 years the plant has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Tioga Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is involved.  The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.
