This system requires that changes such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including operating conditions of the process), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated prior to incorporating these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel and affected contractors are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nThe Jewell Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and reviews these results to Jewell management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nTo determine that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning proper"

The program includes pressure vessels, atmospheric tanks, piping, relief and vent systems, process equipment, pumps, compressors as well as dehydration, hot oil and flaring equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training including:\n(1) an overview of the process, \n(2) safety and health hazards, \n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, \n(4) emergency procedures, and \n(5) work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nWritten inspection, testing and maintenance procedures provide that work is performed properly, and serve as a basis for training maintenance personnel in their assigned duties\n\nInspections and tests are performed to ensure that the equipment functions as intended and to establish a baseline for future monitoring.

Documentation of the individual's training and a record of their competence is kept as part of their personal training file.  Like the Operators, maintenance personnel receive ongoing training in their field and a formal refresher every three years.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nThe Jewell Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce for construction, maintenance and testing.  To ensure that these contractors meet the safety and workplace standard, Jewell personnel complete contractor evaluation forms at regular intervals.  These completed forms are evaluated by safety and management to determine compliance with the established policies, procedures and guidelines.  Contractors must maintain an acceptable score on these reviews to continue working at the facility.  In addition, the Safety Group reviews the contractor's written safety program, its implementation, training and accident history to ensure that it complies with the Jewell Gas Plant requirements.\n\nThe Jewell Gas Plant provides contractors with:\n 1.  A process overview\n 2.  Safety orientation and ensures their understanding through testing.\n 3.  Information about health and safety hazards.\n 4.  Emergency evacuation procedures and mustering location.\n 5.

Jewell uses these procedures for reference by experienced personnel and to provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.\n\nOperating procedures are reviewed and modified whenever there are changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or facility.  Reviewing operating procedures is an element of the Management of Change (MoC) procedure.  In addition, the accuracy of all operating procedures are recertified annually.\n\nTRAINING\nJewell Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program to prepare potential process operators to safely and efficiently operate the facility.  Operators-in-training are taught an overview of the process, operating procedures, lock out/tag out, consequences of deviation, emergency response and operating parameters.  After an initial training phase, each candidate is paired with a senior operator for a minimum of 90 days to learn process specific tasks and duties.  The operator-in-training may remain paired with a senior operator beyond the 90 days if necessary, until they can demonstrate enough proficiency to satisfy the Operations Foreman.  The final step in becoming an operator is passing a rigorous written exam called the Compressor Operator Signoff (COS).  After all these requirements have been met, the new Operator can work independently.  New Operators are monitored by the Operations foremen.  Education is an ongoing process and as such, all operators receive periodic training related to their job duties.  In addition to all of this instruction, formal refresher training is conducted every three years. Each step of the operator training course is documented and becomes a permanent part of the employee's file.\n\nAdditionally, process maintenance personnel receive detailed training in each of the maintenance procedures as well as knowledge to"

The PHA systematically evaluates each process for potential hazards and then recommends change where needed.  These PHAs are revalidated every five years.\n\nThe PHA team is selected from management and employees.

EOG addresses accidental release prevention through four factors:  design, training, operating parameters and regular maintenance.  Through design efforts, we have limited the public exposure.  Through training, we have prepared our personnel to respond effectively.  Limiting the operating parameters reduces the stress on process equipment.  And regular maintenance serves to prolong equipment life as well as discover potential problems before they become a safety issue.\n\nShould an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, EOG personnel will evaluate the  conditions, take actions within their capabilities to minimize the risk and notify the appropriate outside agencies.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nJewell Gas Plant is located in a rural area in Converse County, Wyoming.  The Jewell Gas Plant separates field gas; producing a residue gas product, HD5 propane product, NGL product, and stabilized RVP 12 condensate. The plant capacity is 50 MMscfd. The residue gas connects to the MIGC pipeline. The HD5, NGL, and stabilized condensate is transported via automated truck loadout. The plant includes a Two-Tower Stabilizer, Refrigerated Joule-Thompson Unit, and Fractionation Unit.\nAdditional facilities constituting the Jewell Gas Plant include:\n\u0095\tField condensate receipt and processing to NGL and stabilized condensate (12RVP);\n\u0095\tPressurized and atmospheric product storage;\n\u0095\tHD5 propane odorant injection.\n\n Marplot indicates that there is no population within the area affected by the worst case scenario and no residential housing units.
