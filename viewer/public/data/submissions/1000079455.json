Sulfur Dioxide is also used in the treatment of water.  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to reduce the risk to nearby members of our community, employees of the company, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nBrenntag Southwest owns emergency equipment specifically designed to be able to stop leaks from containers of these products.  This equipment includes Chlorine Institute approved A and B kits for cylinders and ton containers, and a cylinder recovery vessel.  Brenntag employees are trained in the use of this specialized emergency equipment. The company also maintains agreements with area response companies. \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Programs in place at the facility include a Fire Prevention Plan, Emergency Response Plan, and Transportation Emergency Plan.  These plans require the facility to maintain an open door policy with local fire departments and other emergency groups in the area, and to invite emergency responders from both the public and private sectors to tour the facility annually in order to gain knowledge of the physical setup of the plant.  This information becomes very valuable in the event of an emergency incident.  These plans also direct the facility to maintain a working relationship with area clinics and hospitals in order to be prepared during emergency events.   \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBrenntag Southwest, Inc., maintains Health, Safety and Environmental policies including Risk Management, Employee Training, Product Stewardship, Community Outreach, Hazard Communication, and Process Safety Management.

      "SummaryText": "licies require careful review of the hazards and the safeguards in place to prevent releases of regulated chemicals. Along with these programs, the company implements the knowledge gained from being a long-term member of The Chlorine Institute. The Institute establishes written pamphlets and videos to guide facilities in prevention and emergency programs that cover processing, handling, storage, and release of chemicals such as Chlorine.  Coupled with the numerous training programs from the Institute, the company also complies with DOT container specifications, inspections, and testing requirements. These programs and regulations in conjunction with company policy help to ensure the safe operation of the facility.  \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Brenntag Southwest Wichita branch was established in Wichita in the 1980s, and has never experienced a release resulting in on-site or off-site injuries, or had to implement evacuation measures. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility has emergency plans which are coordinated with local fire departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Our response plan for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is based upon the Chlorine Institutes Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The emergency response plans for all company facilities include procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors, the local fire authority, and federal, state, and local agencies.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\n\nIn order to have continuous improvement of its safety record, Brenntag Southwest requires all of its facilities to conduct incident investigations, safety compliance audits, repeat training of normal and emergency procedures, and ongoing community outreach actions including: educating and training neighbors, customers, fire departments, and emergency response teams.
