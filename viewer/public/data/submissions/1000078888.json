The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (\"ECC\").  In addition, the Pasadena PVC facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (\"SSP\") which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe facility is a member of the Southeast Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee (\"LEPC\"), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety [68.155(f)]\n\n\n\nThe Pasadena PVC facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.  Specific changes include installation of additional process controls and enhancements related to the automated isolation of storage spheres and DCS monitoring of process operating conditions.\n\n"
