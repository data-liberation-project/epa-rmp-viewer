The facility utilizes surface water derived from Lake Okeechobee.  Once the raw water is received at the plant its treated using an advance coagulation process.  The treated water is then disinfected before servicing the consumer.  The disinfection process involves the use of chlorine gas to remove pathogens in the water.  The Clean Air Act Section 112 (r), lists chlorine as a regulated toxic substance.  Facilities that store amounts of regulated substance greater than their respective threshold listed in Table 1 of 40 Codes of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.130, must comply with the provisions of 40 CFR parts 68 - the Risk Management Program (RMP).  The City of Belle Glade Water Treatment Plant has a maximum inventory of 30,000 pounds of chlorine gas, which surpasses the 2,500 lb threshold for chlorine.  For this reason, the City of Belle Glade Water Treatment Plant must meet the terms set forth in the RMP.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nAs part of the RMP, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was conducted to determine the potential area effected by a worst-case and alternate release-case scenario and disclose the offsite public and environmental receptors affected by these scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case scenario was modeled using the EPA?s OCA Guidance Reference Table 4-3 and considered a 1-ton chlorine cylinder releasing its full contents in ten minutes.  This accident could result from a cylinder wall failure or puncture.  It was determined that this scenario would have an impact on off site public receptors located within a 1.3-mile radius from the water treatment plant.\n\nThe alternate release scenario considers a 3/8-inch ID flexible plastic tubing conne"

It was determined that this scenario would have an impact on offsite public receptors located within a 0.1-mile radius from the water treatment plant.\n\nNo environmental receptors were identified for either scenario.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn an effort to prevent releases similar to those above, the water plant has up-to-date technological equipment, is standardizing procedures, and is incorporating chlorine training and awareness programs.\n\nThe plant uses vacuum regulators to eliminate leaks or breaks associated with pressure systems. Warning devices such as chlorine gas detectors and chlorine residual analyzers are used to detect leaks. These two systems will be interfaced with the central control computer witch will be located in the central control room.\n\nPlant procedural practices are safety oriented and include procedures for operating, inspecting, changing and maintaining chlorine process equipment.  A training program is provided to familiarize city employees with the chlorine process and safety equipment.  Other programs are available to the plant employees and contractors.\n\n\n5-Year accident History\n\nThe Belle Glade WTP has no reportable accidental releases in the last five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nCity of Belle Glade Water Treatment Plant employees will not be responding to non-incidental releases of chlorine gas.  The plant will be using the local emergency responder, Belle Glade Fire Department."
