      "SummaryText": "P&C Foods (P&C) operates an ammonia refrigeration process at its Perishable Distribution Center in Syracuse, New York.  The facility?s overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by the implementation of OSHA Process Safety Management (?PSM?) procedures.  The facility's management system ensures that facility personnel continue to adhere to these safety procedures.The status of our Risk Management Program is summarized below.\n\nReview of the accident history reveals that no accidents involving ammonia releases causing adverse impacts offsite have occurred within the last five years.  In fact, no such incidents are reported to have ever occurred in the life of the facility to date.\n\nSince the covered process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, the process is subject to full RMP requirements under Program 3 of the RMP rule.  To meet these requirements, P&C has implemented refrigeration system design, installation, maintenance, and operator training guidance provided by the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), coordinated emergency response with the Local Emergency Planning Commission and fire department, and has developed a management system to ensure ongoing RMP compliance.  The facility has developed and instituted procedures to prevent and effectively respond to any accidental releases from the covered process.  These procedures were developed in accordance with both the OSHA PSM standards and RMP requirements.  The facility regularly trains personnel who are responsible for operating and maintaining the processes, both in the classroom and on the job. \n\nThe facility periodically reviews the program, training and maintenance procedures to identify any necessary changes that would improve safety at the facility.  At this time, the facility does not have any changes planned to improve safety."
