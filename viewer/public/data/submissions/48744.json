The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Response section of the PSM/RMP document as well as the Business Plan.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly areas, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was reviewed and updated at least once per year.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Telco facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 2111 West Valley Blvd., Colton, CA 92324 and began operation in 1999.  In October 2000, the facility added new freezer and cooler rooms which required additional evaporators (10), compressors (2), and condenser (1).  In July 2001, an additional separate and independent ammonia refrigeration system containing 22,000 lbs. of ammonia was installed.\n\nThe area immediately surrounding the facility is comprised of commercial areas and vacant fields with residences to the north.  The facility is situated approximately 0.3 miles north of Interstate 10.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the industrial refrigeration system that provides cold storage for food products.  The original ammonia refrigeration system uses 19,100 pounds of ammonia within a closed system for the purpose of manufacturing bakery products.  The July 2001 ammonia system uses 22,000 lbs of ammonia.  The system cycles ammonia through various physical states in order to provide cooling in the bakery production processes and cold storage rooms. \n\n\nHAZAR"

      "SummaryText": "D ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description:  Since this facility has two separate and independent ammonia refrigeration systems, the worst case release is defined as the release scenario that has the greatest off-site consequence.  The worst case release for the original system (installed in 1999) resulted in a release rate of 654 lbs/min.  The worst case release from the second system (2001) resulted in a release rate of 880 lbs/min.  Also both systems are located such that the potential off-site consequences are affected similarly by the distance.  Therefore, the worst case release for the facility is defined as follows:  The Controlled Pressure Receiver #2 (CPR-2) is the largest vessel in both systems (with a capacity of 27,000 pounds of ammonia).  CPR-2 is located in the  ammonia system (July 2001) which has an ammonia charge of 22,000 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire charge is contained in the CPR -2 for the worst case scenario, with the vessel contents released in a 10 minute time span. The release rate was calculated to be 880 pounds per minute, after passive mitigation effects due to the enclosure of the vessel in the Machine Room 2 were taken into account.  For analyzing the worst case release scenario, EPA requires the use of the most pessimistic meteorological conditions that will allow for the maximum downwind exposure.  Low wind speeds (1.5 m/s) and stable conditions (F stability) will allow the gas cloud to travel as far as possible by limiting cloud dispersion. \n\nThe following source was used to identify the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 mg/L). This source uses EPA-approved reference tables:\n\nEPA?s ?General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention?, April 2004, Exhibit E-2[5]. The RMP*Comp Model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and EPA was used to prepare the data in this guidance document.\n\nThis guidance document for Ammonia Refrige"

No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.  \n\nAlternate Release Scenario Summary \n\nScenario Description:  Both systems operate in the same manner; therefore, the alternate release scenarios examined are the same.  The alternative release scenario presented is similar to the worst case in that it is a liquid release.  The alternative release scenario chosen for this facility is that of a 0.25 inch diameter orifice leading to an airborne release, representative of a pump seal leak, a gasket rupture, pinhole leak due to corrosion, flange seal leak, valve bonnet seal leak, etc. It is assumed that this release is from the high side of the second (July 2001) system; therefore at a pressure of 166 psig.  \n\nThis release scenario will be assumed to last one hour, thereby incorporating mitigation measures such as the emergency response plan and actually shutting down the system.  The release rate was calculated (using a simplified version of the Bernoulli equation) as 128 lbs./min.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 7,680 pounds. \n\nEPA allows a facility to use typical meteorological conditions at the facility. For this scenario, a wind speed of 3 meters/second and neutral conditions, D stability, were used for an urban area\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA sensor within Machine Room 1 will alarm at 125 ppm.  A signal is sent to the central computer and is logged within alarm history and will wait for operator response, otherwise, if time occurs, operators are paged.  An initial shutdown occurs at 250 ppm which does the following: (1) Shut down of solenoid valves in order to isolate the ammonia, (2) The purge ventilation fan is turned on with a manual reset required, (3) scrubbing system pumps and fans are turned on with a manual reset required, and"

The facility is equipped with an automatic shut off button located outside of the Machine room.  If a release were to occur, operators can activate this prevention measure.  The majority of the ammonia equipment is located in the Machine Room. \n\nSensors are also located within Machine Room 2 (July 2001) which alarm at 30 ppm.  A signal is sent to the auto dialer (Security Link) who contacts operators.  At 120 ppm, Security Link is instructed to call the fire department.  Exhaust fans are energized and exhaust is routed from engine room to condenser inlet.  Automatic controls energize condenser fans.  Shutdown occurs at 10,000 ppm which de-energizes all of the equipment in the machine room including the compressors.  The facility is equipped with three automatic shut off buttons located outside of the Machine Room 2 doors.  If a release were to occur, managers or operators can activate this prevention measure.  The majority of the ammonia equipment is located in the Machine Room 2.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been one release of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the California threshold of ?any significant? release.  The release occurred on March 17, 2002 and was caused by a service valve leak on the LPR-3 (Low Pressure Receiver).  A brass fitting was installed in the service valve outlet instead of a steel plug.  The valve opened up over time due to continual expansion and contraction of the metal as well as the corrosion of the brass.  The leak resulted in a loss of 1,000 pounds of ammonia and lasted 6 hours and 43 minutes.  There were no injuries or casualties resulting from the ammonia release.  In addition there was no property damage due to the release.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nTelco has an emergency response plan in "

The alarms are tied into the ammonia sensors and will automatically alarm.  Telco management will determine if an evacuation is necessary.  They will call 911 in order to reach the San Bernardino County Fire Department HazMat team who will respond to the ammonia release.  \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe initial Process Hazard Analysis study (including a HAZOP study and What-If Walkthrough) was performed on July 28, 1999 at Telco Food Products, Inc.  There were several mitigation measures recommended at that time.  The majority of those recommendations were completed by June 2000.  ries).\n\nA second Process Hazard Analysis study (including a HAZOP study, checklists and walkthrough) was performed on July 25, 2001 at Telco Food Products, Inc. for the ammonia system installed in July 2001.  \n\nA Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study was conducted on September 7, 2006.  At this time a Seismic Assessment Revalidation and Hazard Assessment Update were also conducted."
