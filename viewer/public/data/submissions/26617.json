FCSA's management is committed to this goal.\n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Chemical\n\nThe Northern Water Filtration Plant, 1381 Brucetown Rd., Clearbrook, VA 22624, withdraws water from abandoned limestone quarries. The water is treated to comply with Safe Drinking Water Act standards and pumped into the distribution system. Chlorine gas is used to disinfect the water and make it safe for consumption. The treatment plant may inventory a maximum of 8,000 lbs. chlorine in one ton containers. \n\nPrevention Program Procedures:\n\nOur prevention program ensures that the elements of the risk management program are integrated and implemented on an ongoing basis, and that there is accountability and responsibility for the overall program and for each element of the program. An organizational table describing the lines of accountability and responsibility is included in the written plan. Our hazard prevention program follows the guidelines of Section 68.175 and addresses the following elements that are tailored to suit the degree of hazards present at our facility and the degree of complexity of our facility's operations:? Process safety information, Section 68.65\nPrior to conducting any process hazard analyses, our facility compiles written process safety information regarding process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment. The purpose of compiling this written material is to enable our facility, and the employees involved in the operating processes at our facility, to identify and understand the potential hazards of processes that involve highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n?

In addition, at least one team member is knowledgeable of the specific process hazard analysis method being used.We have performed an initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) of the chlorine processes at our facility; the analysis is appropriate to the complexity of the process.\n\n? Operating procedures, Section 68.69\n\nThe standard operating procedures at our facility provide clear instructions for properly conducting all activities associated with a covered process. We have developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions to safely conduct activities that are involved in each process. Effective OPs, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the systems and preventing accidental releases.\nOPs are required for all stages of system operation, including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup following emergency shutdown. This procedure applies to the EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulated process.\n\n\n? Training, Section 68.71\n\nThe employee training program at our facility helps our employees understand the nature and the causes of problems that may arise from process operations.\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that personnel working on or near OSHA PSM and/or EPA RMP-regulated chlorine process are adequately trained and understand the inherent process hazards and appropriate response actions to accidental chlorine releases. Well-trained operators are integral to preventing and mitigating the effects of accidental chemical releases. \n\n?

Correction of equipment deficiencies.\n Quality assurance of new equipment.\n The mechanical integrity program covers OSHA PSM and/or EPA RMP-regulated processes at \n the facility, which is presently limited to the chlorine process.\n\n? Management of change, Section 68.75\n\nThe purpose of the Management of Change (MoC) procedure is to ensure that system changes are properly reviewed against original system design specifications and can be accomplished safely, and that the systems are ready to operate safely in accordance with original system design intent following implementation of the change.\n\nFCSA will complete a MoC review for any temporary or permanent change, other than replacement in kind, affecting OSHA PSM and/or EPA RMP-regulated processes, which presently include the chlorine processes.

A major modification is defined as a modification that requires a change in process safety information. In addition, PSSRs will be performed for all new processes regulated under OSHA PSM and EPA RMP.\n\n? Compliance audits, Section 68.79\n\nOur compliance audits evaluate the effectiveness of our compliance with the risk management program, identify any deficiencies in the program, and ensure that corrective actions are implemented in a timely manner. We conduct our audits at least every 3 years and retain the two most recent compliance audit reports. Our audits are conducted by at least one person who is knowledgeable of the process and we ensure that a report of any findings of the audit is developed and all deficiencies are corrected.\n\n The compliance audits will evaluate each PSM and RMP element, develop and implement corrective actions to address any identified deficiencies, and document the entire procedure. Compliance with each requirement will be evaluated based on the answers to the following questions:\nDo the established program procedures satisfy the EPA RMP and OSHA PSM standards?\nAre the established procedures being followed?\n\n?

Contractors, Section 68.87\n\nWhenever contractors perform maintenance or repair, major renovation, or specialty work in and around processes that involve highly hazardous materials, they do so without compromising the health and safety of the employees at our facility. The contractors at our facility are trained to safely perform their jobs, are trained in the applicable provisions of the emergency response plan, and are knowledgeable of the hazards relating to their jobs.\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that only contractors with good health and safety programs are selected to perform work on and around processes that use highly hazardous chemicals, and that the contractors and the processes are properly prepared to safely complete the work. Processes that use highly hazardous chemicals currently include the chlorine processes.\nThis procedure covers evaluating contractor's health and safety information before selection, and evaluating contractors safety performance while working at the facility. This procedure is specific to those contractors who perform work (e.g., maintenance or repair, turnaround, renovation, or specialty work) on and around the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP-regulated processes.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nChlorine gas is the only regulated substance used at this plant requiring OCA. Chlorine gas is delivered to the plant in one-ton cylinders. The cylinders are unloaded directly into a building used solely for chlorine. The cylinders remain in the building until they are loaded directly onto a truck for immediate return to the supplier.  The building has a volume  of over 6000 cubic feet.

The mitigating factor of the building is not considered in computing the release rate to the atmosphere for either scenario. \n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes a one-ton cylinder fails and discharges 2000 pounds of chlorine gas in ten minutes. This results in a discharge rate of 200 pounds per minute to the atmosphere. No active or passive factors are assumed to mitigate this release. The EPA CEPP RMP Guidance, dtd October 1998 (RMP Guidance), determines a footprint with a radius of 1.3 miles around the plant is the area affected by this release. The area has a population of 5200 and public receptors of residences and schools.\n\n\nThe alternate scenario assumes the fusible plug metal blows out on a one ton cylinder filled to capacity. This causes chlorine gas to escape through a 3/8-inch hole. This scenario creates the greatest release of gas to the atmosphere. Using the RMP Guidance, the release rate is 37 pounds per minute with the radius of 0.1 miles around the plant as the footprint of the area affected. This footprint does not affect any public or environmental receptors.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nOur emergency planning and response program addresses the actions that our employees are to take in the event of an unwanted release of a highly hazardous chemical at our facility. We have established an emergency action plan, which provides procedures for planning and responding to a release of a highly hazardous chemical.\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that FCSA maintains up-to-date and complete written emergency action plans (EAPs) and effective response capabilities for all covered processes.
