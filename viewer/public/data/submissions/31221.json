This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with West Shore Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass research and development of pharmaceutical products.  We have (one) 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The regulated substance at our facility is used for Refrigeration purpose only.\n\nThe total inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 70,000.00 lb.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. \n                                                                                 \nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMP Comp program.  An alternative release would assumed to be controlled by passive mitigation controls such as dikes, enclosures, sumps, berms and 24-hour monitoring. The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include sprinkler system(s), deluge system(s), water curtain(s), scrubbers, neutralization and emergency shutdown systems.  \n     \n4.
