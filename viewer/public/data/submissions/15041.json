      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Public Service Company of Colorado (PSC) Arapahoe Station.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are represented in the Emergency Planning and Response Sections of the Arapahoe Station PSM/RMP manuals for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide/sulfur trioxide systems. PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nPSC management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the RMP manuals.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nArapahoe Station is a coal-burning electric generating station.  The regulated substances handled at this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide/sulfur trioxide.  The chlorine is used for cooling and process water biocidal control and is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 4 containers on site.  The maximum sulfur dioxide inventory at the Arapahoe Station is 6500 gallons (73,600 pounds) in the main tank, as maintained using administrative inventory controls.  The maximum amount of SO2 in the day tank is 450 pounds.  (Sulfur trioxide is the result of the chemical reaction between the sulfur dioxide and vanadium pentoxide catalyst.  Sulfur trioxide is consumed for emission control by further chemical reactions as it is generated.)\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case "

      "SummaryText": "and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one-ton container of chlorine and/or 6500 gallons of sulfur dioxide) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  The RMP*Comp air dispersion model was used to determine distances to toxic endpoints.  For sulfur dioxide/sulfur trioxide, a distance of 9.1 miles to the toxic endpoint was calculated for a release of 73,600 pounds in ten minutes.  For chlorine, a distance of 1.3 miles to the toxic endpoint was determined for a release of 2000 pounds in ten minutes.  Since the sulfur dioxide release produces the largest radius of influence, the results of the worst-case release scenario for sulfur dioxide are included in the RMP registration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine consists of a release of 965 pounds of chlorine over a one-hour period due to a severed 5/16 inch pigtail on the one-ton container.  No active mitigation devices were considered to influence the release scenario.  A distance of 0.1 miles to the toxic endpoint was determined.\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide consists of a release of 55,960 pounds of sulfur dioxide over a one-hour period due to overpressurization and subsequent failure of the 2 inch safety relief valve on the sulfur dioxide storage tank.  A distance of 1.3 miles to the toxic endpoint was calculated.\n\nPrevention Steps for Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine Systems\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Arapahoe Station Sulfur Dioxide/Sulfur Trioxide System and Chlorine System PSM/RMP manuals.  The prevention programs include the following elements:\n7 Employe"
