In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility. Failure of the high pressure receiver containing 10,583 pounds of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 30 % of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten minute release.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that wou"

Therefore, we choose this type of release because we believe this to be the most likely potential failure point.  Our example Alternative Scenario would result in a release of 1,140 pounds of ammonia over a time period of 10 minutes.  Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n  Transfer hose failure was not chosen as the alternative release scenario because it is a temporary connection and constructed of materials other than steel.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: emergency equipment such as an excess flow valve on the tank truck and valves to isolate the transfer hose; the facility accident prevention program in place at the facility including operating procedures to have personnel present at all times during unloading, and the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia since this plant has been in operation.\nThis facility\u00bfs emergency response"
