Like many other chemicals, chlorine is beneficial in small doses (diluted in drinking water to disinfect and improve quality) and dangerous in large doses.  Only qualified personnel, properly trained in appropriate operating procedures, are allowed to handle equipment associated with our chlorine systems.  We are committed to safety in all aspects of our operation, and the chlorine storage and handling is no exception.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations, at a minimum.\n\nOur emergency response program includes procedures followed by all employees for notification of the local emergency services department and the facility utilities supervisor.  Additionally, an extensive chlorine detection and monitoring system automatically shuts down the system in the case of malfunctions, and automatically calls/pages facility personnel. \n\nThis facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to supply potable water to the City of Avenal.  Water is drawn from the California Aquaduct and is disinfected and treated to remove bacteria, algae, and other microorganisms.  \n\nThe handling of chlorine at this facility is limited to delivery and change-out of one-ton steel cylinders.  Access to our facility is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nChlorine is the regulated substance used at this facility to destroy pathogenic micro-organisms, oxidize undesirable elements such as iron and manganese, and reduce some tastes and odors.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored at this facility is 6,000 pounds, distributed among two water treatment plants.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s)\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release s"

The chlorine cylinders are housed in an enclosed building, which acts as a passive mitigation system; however, the effect of the building was not included in this analysis at this time.  This facility is located in a remote area, described by rural conditions (for modeling purposes).\n\nFailure of the largest storage cylinder on site when filled to capacity would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire contents of 2,000 pounds are released as vapor, equidistant in all directions until the toxic endpoint is reached (concentration falls below 3 ppm).\n\nUtilizing look-up tables found in Exhibit 4-3 of the EPA document, Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68), the estimated distance to toxic endpoint for a 1-ton cylinder in rural conditions is 3.0 miles.\n\nWritten safe unloading procedures are utilized at this facility which requires that at least two persons participate to ensure that all possible safety precautions are taken.  A worst-case release, like the one described above, is highly unlikely at this facility.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nAlternative release scenarios are being analyzed at this time.  This portion of our RMP is incomplete.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis chlorine storage and handling facility will comply (upon completion)  with California's and EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rules, CalARP and 40 CFR 68.  This facility stores and handles chlorine for onsite treatment of water.  Onsite storage is maintained at a minimum utilizing pre-filled sealed one-ton cylinders.  Chlorine is not filled on site.\n \nThe chlorine systems at this facility were designed and constructed in accordance with good engine"

In most areas of the chlorine system, piping is maintained at a negative pressure to minimize the potential of leaks to the atmosphere.\n\n All employees who handle any of the chlorine equipment have been thoroughly trained utilizing facility and industry specific guidelines.\n\nThe five-year accident history\n\nThis facility has had no reportable accidents associated with the chlorine storage and handling in the last five years.\nThe emergency response program\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is included in the community written emergency response plan.  Local emergency providers will be called in the case of an emergency.  Local emergency providers have periodically visited this facility and are familiar with the associated hazards.  Representatives from the Avenal Fire Department conducted a site visit on May 11, 1999.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety at this time.  Prior to this review, the facility was modified to allow shared use of enclosed, chlorine cylinders.  This was an improvement to safety because the previous system required two separate chlorine staging and storage areas, and one was not protected by a building enclosure.  Additionally, the previous system required more chlorine to be stored on site than was needed or practical for safety reasons."
