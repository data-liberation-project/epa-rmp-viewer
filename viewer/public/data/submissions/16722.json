      "SummaryText": "The Shoal Creek Wastewater Treatment Facility has been treating municipal wastewater for over 50 years while remaining committed to the safety of the community and the environment.  This facility takes pride in observing safety precautions in preventing hazards in the workplace, and possessing structured contingency plans in the unlikely event of a mishap.                                                                                           The City's approach includes (1) The latest technology in monitoring detection systems, and (2) Passive mitigation systems designed to diffuse the impact of a release.                                                                         An off-site consequence analysis has been performed which produced the following worse-case scenario:  The rupture of a 2000-lb cylinder containing Chlorine would be limited to 10-minutes in duration, and would release at a rate of 110 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint under winds of 3.4 miles per hour would be 2.2 miles.                                                                                                                      The rupture of a 2000-pound cylinder containing Sulfur Dioxide would be limited to 10 minutes in duration, and would release at a rate of 110 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint under winds of 3.4 miles per hour would be 2.1 miles.                                                                                                                      Our five-year history contains no releases whatsoever.                                                                                  Our emergency response program has been designed to produce a maximum effective impact in the least amount of time."
