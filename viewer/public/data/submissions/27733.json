All applicable procedures of the Federal and Cal/ARP Programs are adhered to. The Dune Company of Calipatria emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nDune Company of Calipatria stores anhydrous ammonia for sale and application to farmland. The facility stores the following quantities of regulated substances:\n?    Anhydrous Ammonia - 231,000 pounds\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the toxic substance released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by the EPA (0.14 mg/L for anhydrous ammonia). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios for the process, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release scenario.\"  \n\nThe worst case release scenario at Dune Company of Calipatria involves the release of all anhydrous ammonia stored at the facility. Because the anhydrous ammonia storage is in proximity of each other, the total amount of anhydrous ammonia that potentially could be released would amass to approximately 231,000 pounds (lbs). The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for the following set of conditions.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for t"

      "SummaryText": "he worst case scenarios were performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 8.9 miles and an estimate of population potentially affected of 19,698 persons were obtained for the release scenario. \n\nThe alternative release scenarios involved the rupture of a tank possibly due to vehicular damage or vandalism. The amount of ammonia released was predicted to be 12,000 lbs/min and the toxic endpoint distance from ERPG-2 was 1.8 miles. The toxic concentration levels outside this endpoint distance are below the allowable standards for toxic substances established by AIHA. The typical meteorological conditions used for this scenario was a Stability Class D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, average air temperature, and average humidity. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for these scenarios was performed for two sets of conditions. The first set followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n?    Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of a release point is potentially affected. This plume, or footprint, is approximately 6% (one-twentieth) of the area of the full circle.\n\n?    It is not appropriate to compare a 10-minute release to a one hour average standard. The one hour ERPG value can be modified using available time of exposure/concentration relationships to match the ten minute release time.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n?    High level of training of the operators.\n?    Preventative maintenance programs.\n?    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n?    Use of accurate and effective operating pro"
