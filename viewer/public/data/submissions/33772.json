Lesaffre underlines its commitment to the environment, focusing on the limitation of nuisance and the prevention of ecological risks. This policy has made it possible to acquire a level of expertise recognized internationally. It has guided research and targeted investments, reinforcing its will to improve the quality of life for everyone: employees, clients, consumers and area around its production sites.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: The Lesaffre Yeast Corporation facility in Baltimore, Maryland manufactures yeast for sale to the baking and brewing industries and retail consumers. Anhydrous ammonia is used in refrigeration processes at the plant; additionally anhydrous ammonia is used as a raw material for making approximately 30% aqua ammonia solution.  The aqua ammonia is used as a nutrient in the yeast manufacturing process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system has a total charge of 16,000 pounds of ammonia.  An 18,000-gallon storage tank of anhydrous ammonia is present at the site to store anhydrous ammonia prior to use in making aqua ammonia.  Three aqua ammonia storage tanks are present at the site, each with a maximum capacity of 12,000-gallons.\n\nCHEMICAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  The facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing management, training, operating procedures and maintenance systems in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for anhydrous and aqua ammonia as part of the RMP requirements.  The facility has implemented a Program 3 Prevention Program for the anhydrous a"

These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental releases from the aqua ammonia process at the facility. The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, process hazard reviews, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP revisions and updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.  \n  \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  The facility has not incurred any accidents or injuries related to the anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia processes during the previous five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: An emergency response program has been developed and implemented.  The facility has coordinated its emergency response program with the City of Baltimore Fire Department to ensure that any accidental release from the ammonia process will be appropriately addressed.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  The facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation and compliance.  This manager ensures that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, conduct ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and, that investigations will be conducted if required."
