ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt the Rapid River Depropanizer and Storage Facility, we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use our accidental release prevention program in combination with the emergency response planning program to help ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we employ.  This document contains statements and information relating to the following areas:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  An overview of the management system in place to ensure RMP compliance\n\n \n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Rapid River Depropanizer and Storage Facility, owned and operated by Dome Petroleum Corp., a wholly owned subsidary of the BP Amoco Corporation, is located at 10955 U.S. Highway 41 in Rapid River, Michigan.  The facility has one 30,000-barrel storage spheres with an internal can, allowing the sphere to provide storage for inlet NGL and outlet C4+.  Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) are drawn from Lakehead Pipeline.  The NGL is fed to the depropanizer which produces a commercial grade propane product (HD-5 specification) from this NGL feedstock.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nThere are no listed toxic substances at the Rapid River Depropanizer and Storage Facility.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nThere are no listed toxic substances at the Rapid River Depropanizer and Storage Facility.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\nThe RMP rule specifies"

      "SummaryText": "that we identify the greatest quantity of a flammable mixture from a  vessel or from a pipe and calculate the distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure resulting from a vapor cloud explosion of that quantity.  In this case, the contents of the storage sphere at maximum controlled  inventory represent this greatest quantity, i.e., 4,825,500 pounds of natural gas liquids.  The maximum inventory in any sphere is limited by site operating procedures and control devices to 81.2% of total volumetric capacity.  The calculated hazard distance for this worst case scenario is 1.4 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\nThe alternative scenario selected involves the rupture of a loading hose at the propane  truck loading facility.  The scenario assumes that the loading hose ruptures, that the driver does not initiate the emergency shutdown (ESD), that the excess flow valve fails, and that the maximum flow from the loading pumps, 320 gpm, continues until the release is isolated two minutes later when the area gas detectors initiate an ESD.  The released mass under this scenario would amount to 2600 pounds of propane, all of which was assumed to be involved in a vapor cloud explosion.  The endpoint distance to a 1 psi overpressure is 390 feet.\n\nWe use this information in the development of our site and community emergency response plans which attempt to address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n4.1.  PREVENTION PROGRAM (LEVEL 3)\n\nThe process at Rapid River Depropanizer and Storage Facility, which is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation, is also subject to the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  The document which outlines the accident prevention program in use by Dome Petroleum Corp. is Process Safety Management , Performance Basel"

This Performance Baseline document is summarized in the Prevention Program report (not submitted) and covers the following required elements:\n\n *  Process safety information (PSI)\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\n4.2.  CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION SYSTEMS\n\nThe principal hazards associated with the substances at the Rapid River Depropanizer and Storage Facility are fire and explosion and pressurized equipment.  Systems maintained here that contain or control the hazards associated with the substances handled include:\n\n *  Smokeless flare system\n *  Process relief valves and rupture disks\n *  Automated isolation valves\n *  Manual isolation valves\n *  Diking around the storage sphere\n *  Diking between the propane storage bullets\n *  Redundant process, control, and safety equipment\n *  Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)\n *  Continuous monitoring for detection of the presence of atmospheric hydrocarbons\n *  Continuous monitoring for detection of fires\n *  Video surveillance\n\nMitigation systems include:\n *  Fire water system, including a large pond reservoir\n *  Fire extinguishing equipment\n *  Emergency response training for all plant personnel\n *  Emergency response plan coordinated with municipal responders\n *  Personal protective equipment required for workers on site\n\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all accidental releases that occur at our facility.  There have been no accidental releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years at this facility.\n\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain a written integrated contingency plan, which"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate plans with the community emergency response planners, which for us primarily involves establishing response plans with the Rapid River Fire Department.  Public notification procedures are in place.  A summary of the Dome Petroleum Corp. Emergency Procedures Guide, Rapid River Terminal, November 1, 1996, is included in the Emergency Response Plan report (not submitted).  The Guide is organized as follows:\n\n *  Section 1 Immediate Actions\n *  Section 2 Table of Contents\n *  Section 3 Organization\n *  Section 4 Emergency Response\n *  Section 5 Duties and Responsibilities\n *  Section 6 Specific Functions\n *  Section 7 External Resources\n *  Section 8 Recovery\n *  Section 9 Emergency Preparedness\n *  Section 10 Administration\n\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental releases:\n\nAn upgrade to the control system is currently underway.  The new system will allow us to bring in several times the number of monitoring points and is a much faster system, allowing for better real time monitoring of the process.\n\nWe are working with local authorities and other operating facilities in the area to develop an area emergency response exercise for the summer of 1999.\n\n\n8.  RMP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nRichard Boyer, the area foreman, has the responsibility for ensuring that the Rapid River Depropanizer and Storage facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, Ri"
