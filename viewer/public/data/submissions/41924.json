In the unlikely event of an accidental release, it is Sun Pacific's policy to immediately call the local fire department and assist this agency.\n\nSun Pacific is a grower, packer, shipper located at 1250 E. Myer Ave., Exeter, CA that uses chlorine gas stored on site in two one ton tanks sanitizing the wash water in our tomato dump tanks.\n\nRelease Scenarios:\nFor this document two separate release scenarios were used:\"The Worst Case\" as required by law and the \"Alternative Release\"\n(most likely).The worst case scenario was based on a sheared valve releasing 1000 pounds of liquid chlorine gas in 10 minutes.\nDistance to the toxic end point is 3.0 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario was identified thruough the What-If study performed on January 12, 2005 at an RMP/PSM training at Sun Pacific-Exeter conducted by Charles Howell of SEACO Technologies, Inc. This scenario involves a leaking fitting or line that would possibly release 10 lbs.per minute for 15 minutes with a toxic end point of 0.2 miles."
