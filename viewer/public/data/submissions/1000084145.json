      "SummaryText": "Ingredion Incorporated is a global leader in specialty starches. The specialized starch products made in Indianapolis are critical ingredients in food, paper, corrugating, textiles, packaging, building products, cosmetics, adhesives and pharmaceuticals. The principal operations are the wet milling of corn to extract starch and the modification of the starch to create specialty industrial and food starches.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Ingredion Incorporated to follow all Federal and local environmental and safety regulations. Ingredion Incorporated sites operate under a corporate-led Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System. The program details expected practices in areas of Community Awareness and Emergency Response, Pollution Prevention, Process Safety, Employee Health and Safety, Distribution, and Product Stewardship. These management practices govern our daily operations to provide a safe work site for our employees, improve the environment, and contribute to the welfare of our community. \r\n\r\nThe Indianapolis plant processes over 15 million bushels of corn annually. The corn wet milling system separates the corn into four fractions, one of which is starch. The other three fractions, (fiber, high protein meal and germ) are sold for additional processing into corn oil and feed rations. The starches have been produced and developed for very specific uses by our customers. \r\n\r\nThe starch modification process utilizes propylene oxide and phosphorous oxychloride to manufacture food starches that maintain final product texture and stability in refrigerated and frozen food applications. Propylene oxide has no off site impact due to the passive control systems designed into the process. All of the propylene oxide and phosphorous oxychloride systems are covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management program and Ingredion uses this program to minimize the risks in handling, storage, and use of these chemicals.  Propylene oxide is shipped to the facility in bulk railcar q"

To reduce the impact of possible spills, the storage tank is kept completely surrounded with aggregate within a containment dike to significantly reduce dispersion of the material to the atmosphere in event of a spill.  The railcar is protected with a containment pit that can hold the entire contents of the railcar.  Both the railcar and storage tank are equipped with foam deluge systems that will prevent dispersion of material into the atmosphere in event of a spill.  Phosphorus oxychloride is handled in drum quantities, only by specifically trained personnel.  Drums are stored indoors and all process equipment is indoors.  For both materials, air monitors are in place to alert employees if there is a leak or spill of materials.  Only specifically trained maintenance staff perform maintenance activities on either system.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of phosphorous oxychloride or propylene oxide resulting in an offsite consequence during the last five years. There have not been any chemical release incidents during the last five years requiring fire department response.\r\n\r\nIngredion Incorporated employs a multifaceted approach to prevent accidental spills and releases. Accidental spill and release prevention is first addressed in the design phase. The design process includes using a multifunctional team of operators, mechanics, supervisory personnel, chemists and engineers to review all aspects of the process. This includes design criteria, layout, equipment selection, installation procedures, operating procedures and training.  Ingredion also conducts startup planning and prestartup inspections in the design phase. Once the process is installed and operating, ongoing measures constantly take place to assure the process remains safe. These include: continued training of the operators and maintenance employees, management systems to address process changes, mechanical integrity inspections, and thorough inves"

Regular audits are performed to verify that all of these processes and procedures are working successfully.\r\n\r\nIngredion Incorporated has reviewed our emergency response program with the local station of the Indianapolis Fire Department and the Marion County Local Emergency Planning Committee. We conduct ongoing meetings with our residential and business neighbors. We have initiated annual training for the plant Hazardous Material Response Team. A constant effort is made to enhance the level of emergency preparedness, by conducting emergency response drills and coordinating these drills with the local fire department. Information from our drills and the drills held at other Ingredion facilities are shared, so that our manufacturing and safety teams can learn from other experiences. This unified effort of training and sharing information with our residential and business neighbors, as well as other Ingredion Incorporated facilities around the world, creates a safer and healthier work environment for us and our community.\r\n\r\nIngredion continually seeks opportunities to improve the safety of these systems.  Current planned changes include more visual references in procedures and in-process signs and instructions, updates to preventive maintenance schedules, and a review of materials of construction of hoses and fittings."
