(DuPont Dow) is a global supplier of specialty elastomers with headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware.  DuPont Dow is a 50/50 joint venture between certain assets of the E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc. (DuPont) and the Dow Chemical Company (Dow).  The joint venture was formed on April 1, 1996, to consolidate the specialty elastomers' resources, production facilities, technical expertise, and business skills from both companies.  With approximately 1,500 employees worldwide, DuPont Dow offers a wide variety of specialty elastomers with end-use applications in automotive systems, wire and cable, construction, chemical processing, the general rubber industry, and in high-performance parts with excellent temperature, oil, and chemical resistance.  Examples of the end products made with DuPont Dow specialty elastomers include:\n\n? Coatings - from rainwear to liners for roofs and tanks;\n? Automotive products - from power steering pressure hoses to high-performance timing belts;\n? Wire and cable insulation - from electrical wiring to power transmission cable; and\n? Industrial applications - from protective gloves, O-rings, and gaskets to microwave door enclosures and chemical-resistant hoses.\n\nThe 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments established a statutory framework for assessing the risks to public health and the environment arising from the use of certain chemicals.  Regulations specifying what facilities must conduct these risk assessments, how to assess the risk, and what data to report were promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  These regulations are known as the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule and are published in Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68). The DuPont Dow Elastomers Chambers Works facility (facility) must comply with applicable sections of 40 CFR 68. This Executive Summary satisfi"

      "SummaryText": "e Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nThe DuPont Dow Chambers Works facility manufactures Viton? and Kalrez? specialty elastomers that are used in industrial, automotive and aerospace applications. The facility occupies a small portion of DuPont's Chambers Works site located on Route 130 in Deepwater, New Jersey within Salem County. The facility was owned and operated by DuPont prior to the joint venture formation. Because of its DuPont heritage at Chambers Works, DuPont Dow has a broad base of knowledge for, and experience in, handling toxic and flammable substances at the facility in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  The DuPont Dow Chambers Works facility presently has 103 employees. \n\nThree of the substances listed under the RMP regulation are handled at the facility. These substances are:\n\nToxics:\nHydrogen Chloride - Anhydrous (AHCL)\n\nFlammables:\nVinylidene Fluoride (VF2)\nTetrafluoroethylene (TFE)\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nThe RMP rule requires that the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) be communicated to the public for toxic and flammable substances listed in the regulation and present at the facility above a threshold quantity.  The EPA defines the worst-case scenario as the hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated chemical in a 10-minute period. The worst-case scenario assumes the entire quantity is released, even if it is impossible to do so.\n\nSince worst-case scenarios are very improbable, they are not good cases to focus on for emergency response planning with the community. To make emergency response planning more effective, alternative release scenarios are used to provide a more realistic picture of what could actually happen if facility safety systems fail. The scenarios described below were developed using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidance reference tables or equations. Similar scenario analysis and dispersion modeling h"

It assumes the release of the entire storage tank contents (43,000 pounds) with no mitigation. This release has an off site impact per EPA OCA guidelines,.  This release scenario is unlikely due to the design and construction requirements of the storage tank, and its fitness-for-service inspection program. \n\nThe first alternative-case release scenario for Hydrogen Chloride is the discharge from pressure relief devices due to excess pressure build up within the storage tank. This scenario assumes approximately 1,000 pounds of HCL is released in a 15 minute period.  This release does not have an off site impact per EPA OCA guidelines. Administrative controls and mitigation measures for this scenario include:  a storage tank refrigeration system to control tank pressure; control room monitoring of storage tank pressure; storage tank excess pressure alarms; tank refrigeration system failure alarms; storage tank insulation to limit pressure build up rate; controlled venting through a environmental scrubber; and increased process consumption from the tank.   \n\nThe second alternative-case release scenario for Hydrogen Chloride is the discharge from a leak in a tank trailer unloading hose. This scenario assumes approximately 960 pounds of HCL is released in a 30 minute period.  This release does not have an off site impact per EPA OCA guidelines. Administrative controls and mitigation measures for this scenario include:  requirements for operating personnel to be physically present during tank trailer liquid unloading; leak detection monitors surrounding the unloading area; unloading hose design, construction, and fitness-for-service program; and emergency response planning for this and similar release scenarios. \n\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario is for Vinylidene Fluoride.

This scenario assumes 3500 pounds would be released. This release does not have an off site impact per EPA OCA guidelines. Administrative controls and mitigation measures for this scenario include: reduced loading densities during warmer months; procedural trailer pressure monitoring upon arrival and prior to connection for unloading; individual tube isolation until unloading occurs. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nDuPont Dow has employed the concepts of accidental release prevention and process safety management since its formation.  Site practices that incorporate these concepts include the following:\n\n? Thorough understanding of process technology, including the safe limits of the processes and the proper materials of construction for equipment\n? Proper design and installation of equipment\n? Systematic process hazard reviews to identify and address process hazards\n? Written operating and maintenance procedures\n? Extensive training for all persons who operate or maintain chemical process equipment\n? Mechanical integrity testing for detection of potential equipment problems and preventive maintenance to avoid releases\n? Mechanical quality assurance programs to ensure that the correct spare parts are installed whenever maintenance is performed\n?

Contractor safety management system to ensure that work done by contractors is performed safely and in compliance with DuPont Dow standards\n\nIn addition to the practices described above, we have designed our processes to include multiple layers of safeguards.  Examples of these include:\n\n? Computer display and control of process parameters;\n? Interlocks to automatically shut down processes for certain process deviations;\n? HCL monitors in the storage tank area that provide an alarm when a leak is detected;\n? Isolation valves which can be operated remotely from the process control system;\n? Check valves to prevent cross contamination of chemicals;\n? Camera surveillance of process areas in central control rooms;\n? Fire prevention activities like electrical grounding, inerting flammables with nonflammable gases and hot work permitting; and\n? The mechanical integrity of the TFE/HCL and VF2 supply lines is verified by periodic visual inspections and by annual thickness measurements.\n? Flexible unloading hoses that connect the railcar to the chlorine supply line are replaced annually.\n? When hoses are disconnected from the TFE/HCL trailers, the free ends are covered to keep moisture out of the line.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there were no accidental releases of regulated chemicals from the facility resulting in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.

In the case of a chemical release from the facility,  DuPont Dow  personnel contact the DuPont Chambers Works on-site emergency response personnel and fire department to coordinate emergency response activities.  The DuPont emergency responders are thoroughly trained and properly equipped to respond to releases of any chemical used at Chambers Works.  The site also maintains an emergency response brigade comprised of specially trained operators that can lend additional support if necessary.  \n\nThe DuPont Dow Chambers Works facility conducts emergency drills to simulate potential accidental releases and test emergency response plans. Drill critiques are performed to evaluate emergency response plan adequacy and implementation effectiveness.  The DuPont Chambers Works site conducts practice drills with the local community and emergency response organizations.  Chambers Works also supports a siren system in the local community that would provide early warning for a potential release.  This system is coordinated with the Salem County Office of Emergency Response.\n\nIn addition to these on-site activities, DuPont - Chambers Works also maintains transportation emergency response capability to respond to off site chemical transportation incidents.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAs part of the facility's process hazards review procedures, all of the processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.
