This would generate a pressure wave with a minimum 1 psi overpressure extending 0.1 miles.  A search of public receptors within this radius identified commercial properties.  D.  In the event of an emergency involving the Keyera Energy, Inc., Albuquerque Terminal #1's propane transfer system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Bernalillo County Fire Department and request their assistance.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Bernalillo County LEPC.  The Bernalillo County Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.   E.  The Albuquerque Terminal #1 complies with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This propane transfer system was designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions.    F.  To date, this facility has never had an incident involving propane which has resulted in dealth, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place."

      "SummaryText": "A.  Keyera Energy, Inc., committed to the safety of its workers, the public and the environment.  Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures and training.  Keyera has created a comprehensive propane accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance.  It has also delevoped an emergency action plan and coordinated these efforts with local emergency responders (local fire department).      B.  Keyera Energy, Inc. operates a propane transfer terminal in Albuquergue, NM.  Propane is received by rail car and is distributed by truck.  There are two 30,000-gallon rail cars at the site, holding approximately 110,000 pounds each of liquid propane.  There are two 60,000-gallon tanks at the site, holding approximately 220,000 pounds each of liquid propane.  There are emergency shutdown systems on all LPG equipment at the site.    C. The offsite consequence analysis considers a worse-case scenario and an alternative scenario involving a propane release and subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  The RMP Rule states that the explosion endpoint is 1psi overpressure.   The worse-case scenario involves the castastrophic failure of one of the 60,000 gallon tanks holding approximately 220,000 pounds of liquid propane.  It assumes all of the propane is released and ignited.  No passive mitigation is considered.  The explosion endpoint was identified as 0.5 miles (per RMP Comp Ver 1.07).  A search of public receptors within this radius identified commercial, residential, recreation areas and schools.   Keyera has multiple safeguards in place, which make this scenario very unlikely, including an aggressive maintenance and inspection program. The alternative scenario involves a propane release from a Multi-port 2.5-inch relief valve over a 5-minute period at a rate of 863 pounds per minute.  An excess flow check valve is the active mitigation consideration in this sce"
