Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility \n\nThe coop board, management and employees of Watonwan Farm Service, New Richland, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe facility has 1-30,000 gallon storage tank; 1-26,000 gallon storage tank; and 1-18,000 gallon storage tank for an approximate maximum quantity of ammonia stored of 320,000 pounds. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding approximately 40,000-45,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all tank equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections.   Visual checks are to be conducted daily. \n\n4.  The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have: \n\n1. Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or \n2. To our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage"

The plan includes a specific section on NH3 Releases and what to do in the event of a release. The next annual plan review and training for all employees is scheduled to be held in July 2009.\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\nd. A MSDS for anhydrous ammonia as part of their emergency response plan information for quick access and reference.\n\ne. An AWAIR program in place and is committed to a safe working environment.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Installation of suitable barriers in accordance with MN Rules 1513.0160 and 1513.0370 will be completed by September 1, 2009, or by any future rule date changes. Currently, there are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation."
