This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel  and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our refinery adheres to federal and state regulations,  industry standards and practices, Amoco process safety policies and guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on years of company and industry experience.  Examples of specific resource material are: the Process Safety Booklets, the Process Safety Standards and Guideline Manual, the Implementation Guidelines for OSHA 1910.119 and RMP, and the Recommended Good Practices Manuals.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Mandan Refinery is located at 900 Old Red Trail in Mandan, ND.  The refinery is owned by Tesoro Petroleum Company.   The refinery processes 58,000 barrels of crude oil per day in a variety of processes to produce petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG),  etc.  The refinery has ten (10) processes that contain materials above the threshold quantity and are, therefore, covered by the RMP rule. These processes are all classified as Program level 3 processes.  All covered processes contain regulated flammable mixtures above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.   The flammable mixtures typically contain  various regulated substances such as but not limited to hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. In addition, one pro"

The WCS endpoint is based on the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in a process filled to capacity resulting in a VCE.  The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the effect of the WCS.  Based on the distances to the endpoint, calculated using the methodology outlined in the EPA?s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, effects from the WCS would reach offsite.   BP Amoco has calculated the WCS as required by the rule, and has provided detailed information to the EPA and the Morton County and Burleigh County LEPC?s. \n\nFlammable Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS):\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from a release of flammable liquids (primarily butane) from a 2 inch piping leak.  Under this scenario, the release is isolated by operators within 20 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint, calculated using the methodology outlined in the EPA?s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, would reach offsite.   This release scenario was selected based on industry history, and because it is a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  Details concerning the ARS analysis have been provided to the EPA, and the Morton County and Burleigh County LEPC?s. \n\nToxic WCS:\nThe toxic WCS for the refinery involves the chemical Hydrogen Fluoride.   Tesoro has calculated the WCS as required by the rule and has provided detailed information to the EPA and the Morton County and Burleigh County LEPC?s.  The distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint of 20 ppm (0.016 mg/l) would reach offsite. The distance was calculated using t"

The effects of administrative controls, mitigation  systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe quantity of HF used in the WCS calculation would only be present in the deinventory drum during an emergency situation or when the unit is shut down.  During routine operation, the HF acid is contained in multiple smaller vessels where the potential quantity for release is substantially less. The deinventory drum, which is normally empty, is used for storage during maintenance shutdowns at a frequency of about 4 weeks every three years.  However, the quantity of HF stored during maintenance shutdowns is minimized by using administrative controls and would be significantly less.\n\nToxic ARS:\nThe toxic ARS for the refinery is a release of  HF from a 0.75 inch hole in the acid recycle piping.  The affects of automatic water spray mitigation and rapid isolation/deinventory is included for this scenario.   Taking these into account, the distance to the 20 ppm ERPG-2 endpoint would reach offsite.  This distance was calculated using the HEGADAST model.

The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\n\nThe refinery also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Mandan Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Mandan refinery  uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and/or oral tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Mandan Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce generally during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.
