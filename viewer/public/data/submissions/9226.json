In service to the community, the City has a history of adhering to proactive\napproaches for the prevention and emergency response of accidental releases of toxic substances. \nCurrent prevention and emergency response policies adhere to the Environmental Protection\nAgency's (EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the\n40 CFR 68 regulations. \n \nThe Facility is located in the City of Port St. Lucie, Florida and utilizes chlorine gas in the water\ntreatment process.  The Facility maintains  a semi-enclosed (one end open, east exposure)\nchlorination area and chlorination distribution system on-site.  Chlorine is delivered to the central \narea and stored on-site in cylinders containing 2,000 pounds of liquefied chlorine under pressure\nwhen full. The chlorine facility holds a maximum of fourteen (14) 2,000 pound cylinders.  \n\nThe  Facility has an outstanding performance history in conjunction with handling, storing,\nmaintaining and operating of chlorine gas.  No accidental releases have occurred since the system\nwent into service in 1969.  The water treatment plant is manned 24 hours/day, seven (7) day/week,\n365 days/year.  State certified operational personnel are trained in the safe handling, maintenance\nand operation of chlorine systems that comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 regulations.  The chlorination\nsystem is designed utilizing latest technologies and industry specific design codes and standards. \nThe current emergency response plans are documented and coordinated with the community\nemergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). \nOperational sta"

The worst case release is\ndefined by EPA as the owner/operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest\nvessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.  For the worst case release, EPA specifies the\nparameters to use in calculating the distance the chlorine will travel to achieve its  toxic endpoint. \nThe alternative release is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario, such\nas a pipe leak.  \n \nUtilizing the EPA's RMP* COMP Model, a  distance of 3.5 miles was calculated for the worst case\nrelease toxic endpoint and 0.30 miles for the alternative release.  As per EPA regulations, the\npopulation is estimated within the circles defined by the radius' corresponding to the toxic\nendpoints.  These population values are 59,765 for the worst case and 922 for the alternative release. \nIt is noted that if an actual release did occur according to the alternative release scenario, the\npopulation at risk would be substantially less due to the plume of gas being more in the form of an\nelliptical pattern moving down wind of the point source rather than a circle centered on the point\nsource.   \n\fThe use of chlorination for water treatment has yielded enormous benefits in this  area related to\npreventing the spread of water borne diseases.  The City , like virtually every modern treatment\nfacility, understands the value and risks of this treatment procedure.  The City has  an exceptional\ntrack record of no accidental releases in its history and remains ever vigilant in its attention to safety\nregarding chlorine.  The City supports this regulatory effort to inform the public in the general\nvicinity of any utility of the risks associated with accidental gaseous releases.
