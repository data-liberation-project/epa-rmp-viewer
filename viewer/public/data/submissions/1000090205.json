We are also prepared to work with and coordinate with other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n\n\nPassive release prevention efforts include placement of storage tanks, and barriers to vehicular traffic making contact with the tanks.  All bulk storage tanks are located where they are unlikely to be struck by vehicles. \n\n \n\nActive prevention measures include inspection of all tanks at least annually.  All required repairs are completed when noted or prior to further use.  \n\n \n\nEmergency response policies are as described below. \n\n \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: \n\n \n\nThis facility is located north of the intersection of Highway 5 and 50 in Morgan County near Syracuse, Missouri, and supplies anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. \n\n \n\n   The maximum quantity stored would be just over 280,000 pounds in each of our 3 tanks with a 60,000 gallon storage capability. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds. \n\n \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: \n\n \n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1989\", published by The American National \n\nStandards Institute, Inc., and the standard"

The location Manager and other designated employees are authorized to take appropriate actions to stop small releases by shutting off valves, etc.  Other employees will notify the fire protection district, and evacuate the area as necessary.  There is a written emergency response plan \n\nin place that is for the use of, and applies only to, company employees.  This plan includes evacuation procedures, who is authorized to take emergency actions to control a release, notification and alarm procedures, and other necessary information. \n\n\n\nThe facility has; \n\n \n\n   a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38; \n\n \n\n   b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); \n\n \n\n   c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training. \n\n \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: \n\n \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n"
