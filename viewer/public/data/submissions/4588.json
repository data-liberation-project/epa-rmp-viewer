      "SummaryText": "Neches Industrial Park, Inc, has been accident free since start-up November, 1995.  We attribute this excellent record to good safety practices, maintenance preventative/predictive programs and operators that are trained and qualified by OSHA requirements.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is stored at -28 degrees F. to minimize initial flashing in the event of a tank release.  Neches ammonia tanks were constructed by API-620 code, x-rayed and hydrostatically tested.  Emergency vents placed on top of tanks are vented to the flare as well as all safety relief valves. Extensive safety instrumentation is used including alarms, interlocks and ammonia leak detectors.  Tank pressures as well as leak detectors are monitored twenty-four hours each day, seven days a week by an off site security system.    All safety critical equipment is periodically inspected to ensure proper operation and mechanical integrity.   Our ammonia flare is continuosly monitored and video tape recorded using  a fixed camera.  All storage tanks and loading facilities are equipped with automatic emergency block valves to minimize a release.\n\n     Work permits are used to control any hazardous work within the facility and all incidents are fully investigated and actions taken to prevent recurrance.  Management ensures that all personnel have the required level of process knowledge and experience. Fire monitors and safety gear are strategically placed to mitigate the effects of a release of ammonia.\n\n     Emergency response personnel are trained under 29 CFR - Part 1910.156 requirements and quarterly emergency drills are conducted which includes all ammonia and non-ammonia personnel.  We have a detailed emergency response plan that meets all 29 CFR requirements and the Emergency Response Team operates under the Incident Command System.\n\n     Our plant is equipped with an audible warning system  with procedures in place to notify on and off site personnel during an emergency.

      "SummaryText": "monitors weather conditions so that people in the impact zone can be protected.\n\n      Our worst-case scenario is the rupture of a 34,000  short ton, above ground, ammonia storage tank.  While EPA rules would not allow use of water for mitigation when calculating our worst-case scenario, we are of the opinion that our end point distance of 25 miles would be significantly reduced since our tank is near water. The end point distance was concluded by using OCA guidance.\n\n     Our alternative release scenario is the rupture of a truck loading hose.  This scenario was selected due to daily  handling of these hoses.  The end point distance of .2  miles is based  upon Degadis Modeling and residential population would not be effected by this scenario.   The truck loading bay is equipped with fixed fire monitors, emergency block valves, ammonia detectors, alarms, and the entire area is diked with a drain.  All hoses used in ammonia service are hydrostatically tested annually.\n\n     Neches Industrial Park continuously improves safety and equipment integrity by expanding preventive/predictive mechanical programs as well as documented safety audits for compliance of procedures and policies."
