      "SummaryText": "The City of Chattanooga runs and operates MBWWTP in Chattanooga, TN.. The plant uses chlorine, which is classified as an extremely hazardous substance, for disinfection.  Liquid chlorine flows into the bottom of the hot water bath vaporizer and is converted to gaseous chlorine through a series of pipes and a chlorinator.  The vacuum draws the gaseous chlorine into water passing through the injector.  The chlorine gas then goes into solution and is piped to chlorine diffusers, where it is mixed with clarified effluent from secondary clarifiers before entering the chlorine contact tanks.  In these tanks, the chlorine solution is mixed with the clarified effluent to achieve adequate disinfection.\n\nTwo release scenarios were modeled using the Aerial Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) computer program developed by the National Safety Council for emergency planning and training.  The worst-case scenario (i.e., catastrophic falure of a 2000-pound tank over a 10-minute period due to corrosion, impact, or construction defect, a windspeed of 1.5 meters per second, and an atmospheric stability class of F) resulted in a toxic endpoint of 2.6 miles.  Approximately 33,630 people in Marion and Hamilton counties are estimated to reside in the 2.6 mile radius surrounding the facility.  The alternate-case scenario (i.e., a release of liquid chlorine from a horizontal cylindrical 1-ton container through a short pipe or valve in the bottom of the tank, resulting in a two-phase liquid/gas release, a windspeed of 2.24 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of C) resulted in a toxic endpoint of 1.2 miles.  Approximately 3,230 people in Marion and Hamilton counties are estimated to reside in the 1.2 mile radius surrounding the faciltiy.\n\nThe plant is subject to federal requirements, including the preparation of PSM and RMP programs (29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68).  Additionally, MBWWTP is subject to and in compliance with OSHA rules.  MBWWTP has (1) in-house proce"
