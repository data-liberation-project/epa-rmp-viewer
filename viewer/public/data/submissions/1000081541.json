EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nStepan Company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Stepan Company's employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Stepan Company has established operations and management systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage chemical risk at the Stepan Company's Winder facility and complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  One of the requirements associated with the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Stepan Company's Winder Plant.  This 2014 revised RMP is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements associated with the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Stepan Company's Winder Plant.  \n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nStepan Company is committed to the safety of Stepan Company employees, public, and preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Stepan Company implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a chemical release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Stepan Company evaluates each situation, evacuates employees as necessary, and contacts the local fire department to control and contain the release to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  The Winder Plant will also contact the Barrow County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) and LEPC to assist with emergency management.  \n\n\n\nThe Winder facility conducts training and practice exercises on a regular basis to assure effectiveness in emergency res"

      "SummaryText": "ponse.  \n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 The Stepan Company and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nStepan Company is a major manufacturer of specialty and intermediate chemicals used in a broad range of industries.  Stepan Company is a leading merchant producer of surfactants that are the key ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning compounds. Stepan Company's Winder Plant handles two (2) substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the regulation.  \n\n\n\nEthylene Oxide (EO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site (maximum of 4 railcars on site), and used in the alkoxylation process.  The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers, such as fabric softners and ag chemical emulsifiers.  Ethylene Oxide is classified as a toxic gas in the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\nPropylene Oxide (PO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site (maximum of 4 railcars on site), and used in the alkoxylation process. The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers, such as fabric softners and ag chemical emulsifiers.  Propylene Oxide is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nStepan Company's Winder Plant performed an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substances and its effect on the public and environment.  The OCA consists of both Worse Case Scenarios (WCS) and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS).  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility.  Both WCS's and ARS's help the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) improve the community emergency response plan.  The scenarios also assist the Winder Plant for emergency response pre-planning by identifying potentially impacted off-site areas.  The WCS and ARS are completed as defined in the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur off-site because of an accidental release.

      "SummaryText": " Each regulated substance has an independent concentration to estimate the distance to the endpoint.  Endpoints have been defined for toxic and flammable substances and defined by the EPA lookup tables.  \n\n\n\nThe toxic endpoints are defined as concentrations in the RMP Rule.  The concentrations vary among the covered substances based on potential health effects upon exposure.  The endpoints have been defined in a manner that minimizes the potential for long term health effects if exposure to the concentration occurs.\n\n\n\nThe distances to endpoints are estimates using EPA's RMP*Comp as provided on current RMP e-submit website.\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires regulated facilities to estimate the population within a radius defined by the distance to endpoint from the release source.  The populations within the circles associated with WCS and ARS have been estimated using 2010 census data included in Marplot 4.2.2.  \n\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Stepan Company's Winder Plant.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP regulation and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation regulate processes at Stepan Company's Winder facility.  The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\n\n\nThe overall RMP program is managed by the Environmental/Health/Safety (EHS) Manager.  Delineation of specific management responsibilities for each element of the RMP plan is noted in Winder's Integrated Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) section 4.0. \n\n\n\nThe EHS Manager at the Winder Facility is responsible for assuring that the necessary process risk program elements are performed and that the documentation supporting the elements are in place. \n\n\n\nEmpl"

The objective for each investigation is to determine the facts associated with the incident, identify root cause, develop corrective action, and learn from the incident to prevent recurrence.  The investigations are completed using all levels of the organization.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure the process safety management program is functioning properly; The Stepan Company's Winder Plant is audited every 3 years by corporate personnel.  Corporate personnel knowledgeable of the regulations conduct audits.  The audit team may identify findings that are tracked to completion.  \n\n\n\nStepan Company is a member of the American Chemistry Council. ACC members participate in a program titled Responsible Care. \n\n \n\nIn addition to internal audits, the Winder Plant participated in American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Management Certification Program in 2015 and was certified as a RCMS site.  The purpose of the program is to ensure participating companies have management systems regarding environmental, health, and safety.  Stepan Winder was recognized in 2002 as a VPP STAR worksite by OSHA and recertified in 2005, 2010, and 2015.  \n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe prevention program summarized in this document is applied to Program 2 and Program 3 EPA RMP regulated processes at Winder Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by design error, equipment failure, and human error.\n\n\n\nThe Stepan Company's Winder Plant also has safety features on many processes to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences associated with a release.
