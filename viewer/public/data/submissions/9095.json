If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.Facility information\n*The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n*Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n*The maximum quantity stored would be 64,000# in our one tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a sem transport witht the capacity of approximately 40,000#.\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n*The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or semi transport) relased as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 64,000#, which represents the volume the 12,000 gal. storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.82 milies.\n*The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n4.The accidental release prevention program \n*The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage and Hadling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29 Cfr 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous "

A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 DFR 1910.38;\nb.Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nc.A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 DFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n7.Planned changes to improve safety\n*Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations  for implementaion at this time.\n\n         For further information, contact: Dave Jakubowsi, Plant Manager"
