This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by Federal ARP and CalARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe City of Lakeport Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 795 Linda Lane, Lakeport, CA in Lake County, and uses chlorine, a RS, for disinfection in quantities greater than the California threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located in a rural area beyond a low density residential area.  There are no full-time employees at this site.  City operators visit the site daily.  Chlorine is received in 2000lb. (ton) containers by truck, handled with a crane, and stored secured by chains to the tunnions inside the building.  The chlorine is used to disinfect the treated water.   Automatic switchover vacuum regulator valves are attached to the gas valves of two cylinders, one on line and one standby.  Up to four"

In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Lakeport has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency action program coordinated with the Lake County Fire Protection District.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by the City of Lakeport are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.  The City of Lakeport has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and Cal/OSHA requirements at 8 CCR \u00a75189 covering the chlorine process at its Wastewater Treatment Facility utilizing chlorine in ton containers.
