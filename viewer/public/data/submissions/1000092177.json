Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Wurtland Plant's accident prevention program. One way that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is our Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) Committee.   In addition,  Wurtland  has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams have members from all areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Wurtland Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

The Wurtland Plant is a facility reporting under Program 3.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Wurtland Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Wurtland Plant manufactures and processes sulfuric acid in Greenup County Kentucky.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are in use at the site.\r\n\r\nThe Wurtland Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Wurtland identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses three regulated substances in the sulfuric acid process, oleum, sulfur trioxide, and anhydrous hydrogen chloride (Process 1).  In addition,  railcars containing oleum and anhydrous hydrogen chloride are occassionally on-site for a short period of time without active shipping papers (Process 2).\r\n\r\nBased on worst-case analyses, the distances to endpoints [i.e. Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association] exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public).

For the sulfuric acid process area, Wurtland  has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature level, composition) in a Standard Conditions Manual.

What if analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.
