HWY 284\nWACONIA, MN  55387\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT, ANDREW KLEINDL, PLANT MANAGER, (612)-442-2126\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF WACONIA FARM SUPPLY ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITIES IS THE STORAGE OF FERTILIZER FOR SALE TO FARMERS, AND FOR PROPANE SALES AND DELIVERY.   \n\n     ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. PROPANE GAS IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DELIVERY FOR HOME HEATING, FARM AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESS USES.\n\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 53,000 POUNDS IN OUR 12,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF PROPANE GAS STORED WOULD BE 217,000 POUNDS IN OUR TWO 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA. THE WORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 53,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN  STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE THE ENDPOINT (POINT IF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .84 MILES.\n\n     THE WORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85 PERCENT CAPACITY (108,000"

THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n     THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85 PERCENT (108,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN TWO-THIRDS OF A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE. ACCORDING TO EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS (FACTOR OF.67 X .43 MILES =.29 MILES) .29 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n     THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\". IN ADDITION, MINNESOTA DEPT. OF AG RULES. FOR PROPANE, NFPA-58 RULES.\n\n5. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nA. THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA OR PROPANE IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT: \n     HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATH, INJURY, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY; NOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n     THE FACILITY HAS:\n\nA. A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nB. PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n\nC. COORDINATED WITH LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FOR BOTH ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE.\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\n     SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING"
