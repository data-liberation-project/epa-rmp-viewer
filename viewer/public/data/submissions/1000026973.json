It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the LUVERNE Volunteer Fire Department (via 911call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\r\n\r\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the LUVERNE, Iowa location is Terry Thilges, Location Manager. His work and 24 hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The 24 hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT NEW COOPERATIVE, LUVERNE, IOWA\r\n\r\nThis facility is a parking lot staging area for nurse tanks.

The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis. (Spring and Fall) Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operated a total of three (3) months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1). \r\n\r\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\r\nThe worst-case sinario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowes (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to the EPA's RMP*Comp (Version 1.6), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles. The alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release (according to the EPA's RMP*Comp Program) has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles. \r\n\r\nSince this facility is located in relatively clos proximity to the town of LuVerne, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regualtions. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1-1995 and State law.\r\n\r\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.

In the unlikely event that the LuVerne Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our LuVerne location, mutal aid (reciprocal agreement between neighboring fire department) will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 5 LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility.
