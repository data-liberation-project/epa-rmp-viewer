RC facility produces power from natural gas, which uses anhydrous ammonia to reduce Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions in its boiler exhaust and as an air coolant for its gas turbine.\nThe facility is located in the city of Ripon at 944 South Stockton Avenue, within the San Joaquin Valley region of California, approximately 90 miles east of San Francisco.  The facility site occupies approximately 1 acre, and is contiguous with an existing paper mill facility owned and operated by Fox River Paper Company.  \nThe Risk Management Plan at the RC facility is comprised of the following elements:\n?Proper operation and maintenance of all system equipment;\n?Comprehensive employee training; \n?A written emergency response plan;\n?Documented safety procedures for employees and contractors;\n?Inclusion of ammonia specific health, safety, and response data in the RMP; and \n?Use of chemical specific monitors and mitigation systems to detect and mitigate potential releases. \nAs part of its effort to protect the employees and the environment at the site, RC has, and will continue to:\n?Make every effort to keep the workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause injury to employees, the public, or the environment;\n?Train employees in safe and environmentally conscious practices and require compliance with environmental, health, and safety (EHS) regulations, policies, and procedures;\n?Provide professional staff to maintain and support EHS programs; and\n?Fully comply with laws regulating Environmental Protection and Employee Health and Safety.\nThe facility performed an offsite consequence analysis for ammonia to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis includes an evaluation of a worst c"

The worst-case scenario is defined as a catastrophic failure of the largest volume containing piece of equipment in the covered process.  The alternative release scenario is an event that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario and will reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.   \nWith the exception of one event in December of 2003, there have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last 5 years.  The ammonia leak in question resulted in the release of approximately 20-50 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia and lubricant oil from the low temperature (LT) chiller.  The release was the result of a broken ferrule on a piece of stainless steel tubing.  The ammonia release was detected by an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Technician and the fire department was summoned.  The Ripon Fire Department was able to contain and stop the leak without any effects to the surrounding area.  No injuries to site personnel resulted from the leak.  The San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services (OES) representative reviewed the containment procedure and the implemented cleanup measures, and indicated their satisfaction with the response.  As a result of the leak, the tubing was added to the maintenance program and is now regularly inspected during maintenance intervals and monitored for potential wear.\nRC has developed a written emergency response plan and procedures to minimize the effects of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia on employees, the public, and the environment.  The Ripon Fire Department is considered the first responder for accidental releases.  RC has developed appropriate emergency response procedures and plans pursuant to the General Duty clause of the 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68 requirements.  The Ripon Cogeneration facility is not itself considered a first responder at the present time, so RC personnel will perform ?awarenes"

The Emergency Response Plan procedures are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they remain accurate and current.  Employees are trained on the procedure when initially hired, when the procedures are revised, and when employees? responsibilities are changed.  All employees receive annual refresher training on the emergency response program.\nAs part of the RMP update the process hazard analysis (PHA) was updated.  The most significant aspect of this exercise was that the cooling system, previously omitted from the PHA, was added.  The inlet air cooling system presented additional anhydrous ammonia release scenarios at the Ripon facility which had not been previously identified and analyzed.  However, none of these scenarios were deemed to be more likely than the ARS selected in the 2002 PHA.  No changes were made to the ammonia systems as a result of the PHA update."
