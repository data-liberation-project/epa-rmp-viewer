Within the 1.3 mile radius is an school, residential housing, and numerous recreation areas owned by the City of Sault Ste. Marie.\n\n\tThe worst case scenario is highly unlikely due to the fact that it requires liquid chlorine to escape from the container.  We only use chlorine in the gaseous form.  To get the volume of release calculated in the worst case scenario, a ton container would have to vent chlorine through and opening in the thick, steel container wall, which is very unlikely, or by breaking off the lower valve or fusible plug below the liquid line of the container.  Due to the staff's extreme care and extensive training in the handling of the ton containers, this is also highly unlikely.\n\nV.  Alternate Chlorine Release Scenario\n\n\tOur alternate release scenario is designed to represent the most likely type of chlorine release.  It estimates the loss of gaseous chlorine if a 1/4 line was broken and it released gaseous chlorine at a rate of 9# per minute for 10 minutes.  It also represents weather conditions that are more frequent at the Wastewater Treatment Plant; a 3 meter per second wind speed with a class D atmospheric stability.  We also chose a rural topography for our alternate release, because there are relatively few obstructions within the immediate surrounding area of the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  All other data is the same as in the worst case scenario.\n\n\tThe endpoint for our alternate release scenario is 0.2 miles.  A 0.2 mile radius contains a population of 130 people.  The alternate release scenario model is from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\n\tThe chance of breakage on a 1/4 chlorine line is very remote.  Strictly followed procedures, extensive training, and excellent preventive maintenance are just some of the tools our staff uses to prevent even the smallest of chlorine lea"

Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant has never had a release of chlorine since the plant was commissioned in 1959.\n\nVII.  Emergency Response Plan\n\n\tOur emergency response to a chlorine leak can be broken down into two parts: small releases that can be stopped and repaired in-house and larger leaks, where it is beyond the capabilities of the Wastewater Treatment Plant staff to deal with alone.\n\n\tSmall releases are those that chlorine does not leave the Wastewater Treatment Plant's grounds.  These type of releases are stopped and repaired by the Wastewater Treatment Plant staff by shutting down the chlorination system and repairing the defective component.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant staff has an intimate knowledge of all aspects of our chlorination system and receive training in leak repair, chemical safety and Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).\n\n\tFor larger releases that endanger areas beyond the Wastewater Treatment Plant's grounds, the staff shall immediately contact outside help to assist us in controlling the emergency situation.  The outside help is the Chippewa County Office of Emergency Services.  We shall invoke the Emergency Operations Plan for Chippewa County and notify and/or evacuate the effected public and prevent the release from becoming larger.\n\n\tParticipants of the Chippewa County Emergency Operations Plant are:\n\n\t\t1.

The active ton containers are stored in the Chlorine Room.  The non-active ton containers are stored adjacent to the Chlorine Room on a rail mounted holding system designed specifically for ton containers.  The Chlorine Room is kept locked at all times.  Only authorized Wastewater Treatment Plant employees have access to the Chlorine Room.\n\n\tThe Chlorine Room has a sensitive alarm system that activates in the event of the most minute chlorine leak.  The maximum inventory capability is eight ton containers, although normal inventory levels are often less than half that amount.\n\n\tOur chlorination flow pattern begins at our ton containers.  Container pressure pushes the chlorine gas (not liquid) to the chlorinator.  The chlorinator meters, controls, and injects the chlorine gas into a water line forming a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is piped to a jet disinfection pump, which in turn delivers the solution to a contact tank, where the disinfection process takes place.\n\nII.  Regulated Substances\n\n\tOur chlorine supply is the only substance that falls under the Section 112r regulations.  Our chlorine is also regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\tChlorine is considered a toxic substance and has a characteristic, penetrating, and irritating odor.  The gas is greenish-yellow in color and the liquid is clear amber in color.  Gaseous chlorine is heavier than air and will sink to lower levels in a release.  It is non-flammable and alone it is stable, but it is a strong oxidizer and will and can react with a variety of hydrocarbons and metals.\n\n\tChlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant.  At chlorine concentrations above 5 parts per million, the gas is very irritating.  At concentrations near the threshold of smell (well below 1 part per million for most people) chlorine"

The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\n\tThe Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant takes a many-faceted approach to the safe handling of our chlorine and chlorination equipment.  We follow OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals rule to assist us in our use of chlorine.  \n\n\tOur chlorine safety program begins with employee involvement.  All Wastewater Treatment Plant employees have a hand in it's formation.  We have bi-monthly safety meetings held on the first and third Wednesdays of each month.  These meetings also cover topics related to chlorine safety, such as lock-out/tag-out, and personal protective equipment.  Employees are encouraged to bring new safety issues to the meetings.\n\n\tIt is a goal of the Wastewater Treatment Plant management and the City of Sault Ste. Marie to have a well trained workforce who can safely, correctly, and quickly respond to any situation by relying on their previous training and common sense to overcome any hazardous situation that may confront them.  Training is the key to this goal, so all employees receive documented training on all our operating procedures.  No employee can work a shift alone until they have become fully trained.\n\n\tOur operating procedures are annually reviewed by the staff to make sure they reflect any changes made to the operations or equipment.  Our operating procedures are also checked to see if they could be made safer or more efficient.\n\n\tWe have an extensive maintenance program at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  All chlorination equipment's maintenance requirements are documented and scheduled.  Procedures,"

If an employee finds, or suspects a piece of equipment not to be performing up to specifications, it shall be removed from service and a work order made out to notify maintenance personnel of the problem.  All work orders relating to our chlorination equipment receive the highest priority.\n\n\tThe staff performed a Process Hazard Analysis on our chlorination system and all it's components and procedures.  We used the What If method and wrote numerous What If scenarios.  We answered the scenarios as a group and now include them in our operating procedures and our contingency plan.\n\n\tIn short, Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant employees are trained in Process Safety Management, Process Hazard Analysis, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, standard safety practices, and safe work practices on a continuing basis to guard against the possibility of a chlorine release.  In the unlikely event of a chlorine release, the staff is trained in stopping and repairing the release and to know when to call in outside help if necessary.\n\n\t\n\nIV.  Worst Case Scenario\n\n\tOur worst case scenario for chlorine release is the complete release of a full ton container in 10 minutes, which represents a release rate of 200 lbs of chlorine per minute.\n\n\tThe model we used for our worst case is the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants reference tables and equations.  The conditions in the worst case are a class F atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity at 250 C with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  The height of the release is at ground level.  Even though we have a relatively low population in the surrounding area of the Wastewater Treatment Plant, we selected the urban topography as directed in the RMP Submit instructions because of the surrounding buildings that represent obstructions."

The Wastewater Treatment Plant staff shall provide all necessary information to prepare the responding agencies to take the proper actions.\n\n\tThe Wastewater Treatment Plant staff shall make every effort to safely contain and stop the release using the proper techniques, personal protective equipment and our Chlorine Repair Kit B which has the capability to repair any type of release from a ton container.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant staff are regularly training in the use or all emergency equipment.\n\nVIII.  The Future of the Wastewater Treatment Plant's Chlorination & Operation of Chlorination Equipment.\n\n\tThe City of Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant has no current plans to replace our chlorine disinfection using ton containers.\n\n\tWe could switch to 150 lbs cylinders and thus relieve us of these Risk Management requirements, but it is the opinion of the management and staff that the risk of a chlorine leak is greater with the smaller cylinders than our current practices, simply because we would have to change them more often, providing more opportunity for our alternate release scenario to occur.\n\n\tOur primary mission is to maintain and protect the integrity of the St. Mary's River for recreational and industrial use.  We also strongly believe in protecting our downstream neighbors drinking water supplies.  Our current chlorination equipment is the most economical and effective way of meeting these goals.

The City's boundaries are the St. Mary's River on the East, North, and West sides and 3 Mile Road as it's Southern border.\n\n\tThe citizens of Sault Ste.
