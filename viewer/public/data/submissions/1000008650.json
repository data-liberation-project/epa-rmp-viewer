In the production process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of an accidental release.\n\n - Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is stored in the tank farm in three storage vessels.  Additionally, a tank car may be on site for unloading purposes.  Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used in the manufacture of fluorine and the conversion of uranium dioxide to uranium tetrafluoride.\n\n - Anhydrous Ammonia\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in tank farm facilities in two storage vessels.  Additionally, a tank car may be on site for unloading purposes.  Ammonia is used for the production of hydrogen gas, which is consumed on site for the reduction of uranium ore concentrates to uranium dioxide.\n\n - Liquid Fluorine\nLiquid fluorine is produced on site and stored in four insulated storage vessels.  The vessels are cooled with liquid nitrogen contained within the jacket that surrounds the vessel.  Liquid fluorine is produced as needed and consumed in the manufacture of iodine pentafluoride, and antimony pentafluoride. \n\n3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \n\nThe general accident prevention for a Program 3 RMP facility is very comprehensive, consisting of twelve elements.  These elements are part of Occupational Safety and Health Act - Process Safety Management Regulations (OSHA 1910.119).  The general accident prevention elements are as follows.\n\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-Startup Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Work Permits\n- Contractors\n\nThe Metropolis Works uses its Management of Change (MOC) process to assure plant co"

This incident is briefly described below.\n\n- On March 17, 2007 an employee received an injury as a result of maintenance on and subsequent leaking of a hydrogen fluoride line.\n\n\n5) The Emergency Response Plan: \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan (ERP) describes measures developed and implemented at Honeywell Specialty Chemicals Metropolis Works for preventing, recognizing, and responding to emergency conditions that may arise at the plant. These measures have been developed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from events that may arise during facility operations, including fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials to air, soil, or surface water. The Metropolis Works' ERP has been developed to facilitate the rapid, orderly assembly of plant personnel and to a"

This plan is intended to be fully consistent with the multiple regulatory requirements that apply to activities at the plant, including 10 CFR 40.31(j) and 29 CFR 1910.120(q). The Metropolis Works maintains a separate RCRA Contingency Plan that has been developed to implement the requirements of 40 CFR 264 and related regulations. The provisions of the RCRA Contingency Plan augment and complement the provisions of the ERP.\n\nThe ERP addresses the following subjects:\n? Pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside agencies\n? Personnel roles, lines of authority, training and communication\n? Emergency prevention, recognition, and classification\n? Safe distances and places of refuge\n? Site security and control\n? Evacuation routes and procedures\n? Decontamination\n? Emergency medical treatment and first aid\n? Emergency alerting and response procedures\n? Personal protective equipment and emergency equipment\n? Critique, debrief, and follow-up procedures\n\nNotification of Public Officials\nUpon declaration of an Alert or Site Area Emergency, the Incident Commander completes a\nchecklist that establishes the pertinent information to be communicated to the local emergency\nservices office. \n\nThe pertinent information includes the following:\n? Facility identification\n? Name of person reporting\n? Classification of emergency\n? Description of event and facility conditions\n? Status and magnitude of any radioactive or hazardous material releases\n? Status and nature of any injuries\n? Recommended"

Follow-up communications are made to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and to the NRC Operations Center. The notification to the NRCOC includes verification that the local and state officials have been notified of the event.\n\nSome additional prevention/mitigation measures that have been taken in the last four years:\n\n- Installed D/E Vaporizer Load Cells;\n- Replaced perimeter release monitors;\n- Purchased handheld radios;\n- Restart Action List - Mech., Elec/Inst;\n- Safe Haven Control Room;\n- Install lighting, ground warning system;\n- Start-up: Emergency Response Sirens;\n- Security Capture Area Lighting;\n- Smoke detectors and red lights in FMB;\n- Security Central Alarm System;\n- Flowmeters - GF2 H2 Scrubbers;\n- Replace A & B Substation Feeders;\n- Replace underground gas line;\n- Firewall.\n\n6)    Planned Changes to Improve Safety: \n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs) of Honeywell Metropolis Works? storage and processes using hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous ammonia, and fluorine are being updated according to a schedule, with the PHA for ammonia currently being conducted.  The purpose of these systematic safety reviews is to confirm system documentation and identify opportunities to improve upon the existing safeguards of the covered equipment and to further reduce the potential for accidental release.  The PHAs will be reviewed and revalidated at least every five years and improvements made as appropriate.\n"
