      "SummaryText": "We are a retail fertilizer facility.The only material considered hazardous at this facility is anhydrous ammonia. Our facility has one\n21,500 gallon tank and one 18,000 gallon tank for ammonia storage, equipment for receiving ammonia by truck and equipment for\ntransferring ammonia from storage to trucks, then to applicators. It is our policy to meet or exceed, all local, state, and national \nstandards relating to the safe handling of ammonia.\n\nSherman County Farm Chemicals & Fertilizer has never had any accidents or releases with off site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Pressure relief valves on the storage tanks to prevent overpressuring and  rupturing of the tank.\n2. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any of the anhydrous ammonia line or hose were to break.\n\nTo futher ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for the safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe plant operation and maintenance procedures. We have also coordinated with the North sherman Rural Fire Protection  District to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. We will not include this information in this summary to comply with new regulation added 4/09/04 ."
