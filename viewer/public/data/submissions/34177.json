[Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the plant in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity: propane, natural gasoline, n-butane, isobutane, and ethane.  [Note:  Natural gasoline is exempt from threshold determination provisions of the regulation based on its National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 3.]  There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the plant does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure.?  For flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  Propane was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the propane in the largest propane vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance.

We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors.  In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are placed in service, and the Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility follows a rigorous Mechanical Integrity Program to ensure that all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected, to prevent leakage or failure.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulations require the operator to model a single ?alternative release scenario? for all regulated flammable substances.  For the Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a seal failure on the ethane pipeline pump, which was assumed to last for ten minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as leak detection gas detection and emergency shutdown systems would enable the plant to isolate and eliminate such a release within that time-frame.  The alternative release scenario has off-site impact as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance. \n\n    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n    AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.

This is a systematic procedure in which each part of the process is systematically examined to identify all of the potential hazards associated with the process, and to ensure that appropriate recommendations are developed and implemented to eliminate or control the potential hazards.\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis procedure utilized at the Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility is carried out by a team of functional experts from engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety, who work with a PHA Facilitator to identify and evaluate all of the potential hazards that could possibly result in a release of a regulated substance. The team also evaluates potential mitigation measures and accident prevention measures for each potential process hazard at the facility.  The final part of the procedure requires the team to make specific suggestions for management consideration to address or mitigate each identified hazard.\n\nThe PHA team's findings and suggestions are provided to plant management for further evaluation and resolution.  All approved mitigation options are then tracked as part of the process until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards are continuously evaluated and maintained in a safe condition, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the Process Hazard Analysis.  These periodic reviews are conducted every 5 years and will continue at this frequency as long as the plant is in operation.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

Each contract employee is provided an orientation on the known potential fire, explosion, or release hazards related to the contractor's work and the process, as well as the applicable provisions of the incident response plan.  \n\nContractor safety programs and safety performance are evaluated and become part of ConocoPhillips contractor selection process.  ConocoPhillips personnel periodically monitor contractor safety programs and performance records.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\n    Throughout the life of any operating facility, changes will often be necessary -- for example, to meet changing circumstances, to make needed improvements, or to alter the technology of the process.  The Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the plant's processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical"

A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training regarding the process modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure before startup of the modified process or unit that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  Another key purpose of the PSSRs is to ensure that all personnel have been trained on the modification, including any revisions to the operating procedures or to the safety systems and controls.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that all personnel and supporting systems are operationally ready to operate the newly-modified process or equipment.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction, and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention, Process Safety Management Program, and Risk Management Program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n    The Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment in a safe operating condition.  This mechanical integrity program includes pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems, among other items.

In addition to being used in training, written procedures are intended to ensure that maintenance work is performed in a consistent manner.  \n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that the proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nAs part of the design and startup of the facility, the Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility developed safe work practices designed to ensure worker and process safety and these safe work practices are followed to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  Examples of safe work practices include:\n\n1.    control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, \n2.    a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance,\n3."
