NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility at any given time is 12,713 gallons (52,605 lbs). The Goforth Plant also utilizes propane, a regulated flammable substance, as part of the process. The propane is handled in various aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves. The maximum inventory of propane at the facility at any given time is 5,842 gallons (24,573 lbs).\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Goforth Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL or propane. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA\u00bfs PSM. The Goforth Plant\u00bfs Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the facility\u00bfs PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.

For this reason, no accidental releases of NGL or propane occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to January 2007.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Goforth Plant maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the facility. Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained. Furthermore, the facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Parker County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Benbrook Fire Department. The Benbrook Fire Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL and/or propane release.  For these reasons, the Goforth Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the facility. Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM Rules are included in the Goforth Plant\u00bfs PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  \n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nMaintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety.

      "SummaryText": "The Goforth Processing Plant (Goforth Plant) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \u00bfregulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\u00bf in the processing of natural gas, where natural gas liquids (NGL) are extracted from the inlet gas using a propane refrigeration process and treated by an amine unit prior to being delivered to the pipeline for further market distribution. Therefore, this facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Goforth Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Goforth Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA\u00bfs RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA\u00bfs 40 CFR 68 \u00bf Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA\u00bfs PSM. \n\nThe Goforth Plant is a newly constructed facility; therefore, it has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \n\nThe Goforth Plant employs four (4) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility. \n\nCrosstex CCNG Processing, Ltd. (Crosstex) first submitted a RMP to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in March 2006. However, in June 2006, Crosstex purchased a compressor station, located adjacent to the processing plant, to support the existing natural gas processing operation. As a resu"
