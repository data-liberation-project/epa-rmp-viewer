If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the local fire department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency.  Incidental to the notification to the local fire department, a call to the Plymouth County Emergency Management Agency will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned.  In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow. \r\n\r\nThe emergency action plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., anhydrous ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.

The anhydrous ammonia, stored at this facility, is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.  The system consists of storage vessel(s) with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment.  From time-to-time throughout the year, portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is operated on a sea"

In the unlikely event the local fire department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at the facility, the reciprocal fire department will be summoned.

This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors."
