We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n An overview of our emergency response program\n An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility produces a wide variety of specialty chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario  Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAmmonia\n\nThe worst case scenario involves failure of the storage tank containing 58,000 pounds of ammonia.  Using the weather conditions specified by USEPA (10 minute release, Class F stability, 25 degrees C, 1.5 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the ammonia could travel 3.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are: one school (Garyville Mt. Airy Math and Science Magnet School); the communities of Garyville, Mt. Airy and Wallace (total affected population - 3,100); and several industrial facilities (Stockhausen, Marathon - Ashland, LaRoche, Kaiser, CII, and Epsilon).  No active mitigation measures are allowed to be considered under this scenario. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios  Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAmmonia\n\nThe alternative case scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing 500 pounds of ammonia.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA ( Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the ammonia could travel 0.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are portions of the community of Mt. Airy (total affected population - 20) and one industrial facility (Stockhausen).  Active mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the excess flow valves installed in the ammonia transfer piping system. \n\nAcrylonitrile\n\nThe alternative case scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing 8,310 pounds of acrylonitrile.

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n5.0 Five-year Accident History \n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThere have been no accidental chemical releases involving these materials above their Regulated Quantity (RQ) at our facility in the last five years.  There have been several small releases of dimethylamine.  None of these resulted in injuries to employees, nor did any affect the community or environment.  After each of these incidents, we conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the event.  None of these incidents met the requirements to be reported under EPA's RMP.\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Plan\n\nWe maintain a contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
