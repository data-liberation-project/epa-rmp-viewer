      "SummaryText": "The City of Athens, Texas developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to be implemented at the West Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) in an effort to protect human health, to protect the environment and comply with applicable federal regulations.  This plant is operated by the City of Athens.  The plant physical address is 7100 County Road 1500, Athens, Henderson County, Texas.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has been developed to meet the standards published in the 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  These regulations were promulgated by the EPA to cover the accidental release prevention provision under the Clean Air Act 112(r)(7).  These regulations require facilities that exceed the cited threshold quantities for certain chemicals to develop a RMP.  The goal of a RMP is to focus on reducing the risk of accidental releases of certain chemicals; thereby, preventing harm to employees as well as potentially catastrophic impacts on the public.  \r\n\r\nEntrance to the West WWTP is controlled by fencing and locked gates.  The plant is located in a semi remote area away from the general populace.  However, public traveled highways are located in the close proximity of the West WWTP.  The city utilizes chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas in its treatment process.   The one ton containers of chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas are stored within are ASME coded vessels.  During the design and construction of this plant, the engineers used guidelines set forth by the National Chlorine Institute.  All external piping is protected from accidental damage by channel iron.  The feed equipment is inspected daily.  All personnel that work inside the plant have received instructions and training in the safe handling of chlorine and ammonia gases as well as the use of self contained breathing apparatus.

The off-site consequence analysis (Reference Section 3) indicates that there could be off-site consequences if a chemical release of chlorine gas or  sulfur dioxide gas occurred at the West Waste Water Treatment Plant; therefore, the facility falls in Program Level 2.\r\n\r\nGeneral Requirements\r\n\r\nThe regulations outline five specific requirements for Program Level 2 facilities.  By June 21, 1999, each facility covered under the Risk Management Program rule must have completed and submitted to the EPA a Risk Management Plan.  The EPA has requested that all submittals be transmitted electronically on their forms with appropriate figures or maps.  For reference, a copy of the form has been included within Section B- Hazard Assessment.  A facility in Program Level 2 must conduct a hazard analysis, develop a prevention plan, implement an emergency response plan, and report any chemical accidents that have occurred the past five years.\r\n\r\nThe West WWTP Risk Management Program Level 2 includes the following requirements:\r\n \r\n\t40 CFR A\u00a7 68.48   Safety Information \r\n\t40 CFR A\u00a7 68.50   Hazard Review\r\n\t40 CFR A\u00a7 68.52   Operating Procedures\r\n\t40 CFR A\u00a7 68.54   Training \r\n\t40 CFR A\u00a7 68.56   Maintenance\r\n\t40 CFR A\u00a7 68.58   Compliance Audits\r\n\t40 CFR A\u00a7 68.60   Incident Investigation\r\n\r\n\r\nToxicology/Physical Properties\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that employees are informed about the physical properties and potential health hazards of the chemicals located at the facility.

Chlorine gas is not explosive or flammable; however, it may support combustion.  It is a strong oxidizer and may react violently with substances such as water, ammonia, fuel oil, etc.  Chlorine gas is more dense than air (vapor density= 2.49) and tends to settle in low areas.  It has a greenish-yellow color, and a strong pungent irritating odor with an odor threshold of approximately 3.5 ppm.  At standard temperature and pressure 1 ppm chlorine is equal to 2.76 milligrams per cubic meter in air.\r\n\r\nThe primary health hazard from chlorine exposure is damage to the respiratory system. It can also irritate the mucous membranes and targets the eyes, and skin.  In extreme cases, death by suffocation can result.  Frostbite may also occur if direct contact is made with liquefied chlorine.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lists 10-ppm chlorine in air as immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH).  NIOSH recommends a ceiling value of 0.5 ppm chlorine in air while OSHA regulations list 1.0-ppm chlorine in air as the ceiling value.\r\n\r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide\r\n\r\nSulfur dioxide is a corrosive and poisonous colorless gas with a characteristically irritating and pungent odor.  It is also regulated as an extremely hazardous substance under Section 304.  It is a nonflammable gas that reacts with water to form sulfurous acid and produce toxic and corrosive fumes.  Sulfur dioxide tends to settle in low places (vapor density = 2.62).  Sulfur dioxide is typically delivered to the site as a liquefied compressed non-flammable gas.  It is either incompatible or reacts with copper, brass, aluminum and ammonia.\r\n\r\nSulfur dioxide can damage the upper respiratory tract and the bronchi, as it can produce respiratory paralysis.  In addition, it can irritate the eyes as well as inflame the conjunctiva.  Exposures to this chemical can be fatal.  Sulfur d"

Sulfur dioxide can be detected by taste at a concentration of approximately 0.3-ppm, and is usually detected by odor at 3-ppm. Concentration between 6-ppm and 12-ppm can irritate the nose and throat.  100-ppm of sulfur dioxide in ambient air is considered to be an IDLH condition.  OSHA regulates a maximum of 5-ppm work place air concentration of sulphur dioxide.  NIOSH recommends a 2-ppm concentration with a ceiling concentration of 5-ppm sulfur dioxide in air.  The conversion between ppm and mg/m3 is 1-ppm = 2.62 mg/m3.\r\n\r\nIf a person is exposed to this chemical, and experiences toxic symptoms such as the occurrence of irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, they should immediately be removed to fresh air.  If the eyes are involved, they should be irrigated with large quantities of warm water.\r\n\r\n Worst Case  Scenario\r\n\r\nThe EPA requires that for each chemical stored that exceeds the threshold quantity, a \"worst case\" scenario should be performed to determine the off-site consequence of accidental release.  The EPA defines the \"worst case\" scenario as follows:  The largest single vessel, container or pipe that contains the chemical of concern releases the entire contents as a gas when full during a ten \r\nminute time period.\r\n    \r\nThe definition also assumes that during the release, atmospheric conditions are Class F, ambient air temperature is 77 degrees Fahrenheit (F), and wind speed is 1.5 meters per second. \r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered to the West WWTP in one-ton containers.  Sulfur dioxide is delivered and stored in one ton containers.\r\n\r\nThe assumed rates of release for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are 200 pounds per minute (lbs./min).

These release scenarios consider items such as line breaks, valve failure, seal failure, vent failure, etc.  In order to provide for the highest degree of public protection, the scenario that had the highest release rate of the chemical of concern was used in the alternate release scenario.  For chlorine, the 1 inch feed line was assumed to completely break or shear near the storage tank.  For sulfur dioxide in a similar manner, the 1 inch feed line was assumed to break or shear completely near the tank. Automatic tank shut-off valves are installed, but were considered to fail in this analysis.\r\n\r\nThe same end point concentrations were used in the \"worst case\" scenario."

Whenever possible, no person should work alone on a chlorine leak.  An emergency plan of action should be implemented and include training of personnel who could become involved in a chlorine related emergency.\r\n\r\nEffective emergency response in handling chlorine leaks and spills depends on the effectiveness and competence of the employees on site who can assess a situation and act accordingly.  It is the responsibility of the supervisors to train their employees to use personal protective and other safety equipment properly.  It is also the responsibility of the supervisors to educate their employees properly handling of chlorine and the dangers related to the mishandling of the chemical.
