If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Town of Menasha Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is a manufacturer of corrugated shipping containers.  Propane is used as a backup fuel for natural gas.  The propane system consists of one 30,000-gallon propane tank, associated piping, valves,  and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is the failure of the 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 600 F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the Risk Management Plan Calculator software program by Envirowin Software, Inc., which is based upon EPAs look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.39 miles.  There are approximately 50 private residences within the  distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 200 people.\n\nThe Alternate-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario is a vapor cloud explosion, resulting from a break in the 2-inch liquid piping, in the middle of winter, and the release of 38,350 pounds of propane.  According to the Risk Management Plan Calculator software program by Envirowin Software, Inc., which is based upon EPAs look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.17 miles.  There is 1 private residence within the\ndistance to the endpoint, with a total population of 3 people.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility complies with EPAs accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-Y"
