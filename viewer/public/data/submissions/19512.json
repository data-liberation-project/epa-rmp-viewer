(\"Honda\") has developed and implemented two policies \nwhich directly impact and influence Honda's accident release prevention and emergency \nresponse activities.  First, Honda's Safety Policy expresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n- provide a safe and healthful working environment,\n- conduct its operations with the highest regard for associate safety,\n- continually improve the safety management system, \n- train associates in respects to safety related to their job, and\n- comply with all applicable safety and health requirements and standards mandated by \nfederal, state, and local law.\n\nSecond, Honda has developed and implemented an Environmental Policy which \nexpresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n- comply with all applicable environmental requirements mandated by federal, state, \nand local law,\n- operate and continually improve an environmental management system, and \n- implement methods to prevent pollution, conserve natural resources and reduce \nwaste.\n\nWith these policies as a foundation, Honda's Anna Engine Plant (Honda/AEP) has made \na significant effort to ensure compliance and good management in all areas relating to \nchemical safety.  Many of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements are similar or \nidentical to requirements covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the two Honda processes \nsubject to RMP regulation are already subject to PSM requirements.  Moreover, even \nbefore the OSHA PSM standard was adopted as a final rule, Honda/AEP maintained a \nhigh level of protection from potential chemical exposures for all AEP associates.  This \nwas accomplished through: operational controls, systems design, mechanical integrity\nand associate training.  Upon OSHA's final implementation of the PSM standard"

      "SummaryText": ", existing \nHonda/AEP procedures were reviewed, and if needed, revised and upgraded to \nassure that the plant met all applicable PSM requirements.  In many respects, procedures\nto prevent or control unwanted releases at Honda/AEP currently exceed PSM requirements\nrelative to mechanical integrity and associate training.  For example, Honda/AEP uses \nfixed head monitoring devices to detect leaks and/or releases, uses grade-specified \ncomponents, replaces hardware prior to manufacturer-suggested replacement intervals, \nand has implemented comprehensive associate training.\n\nA Brief Description of the AEP Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nHonda/AEP primarily consists of six manufacturing departments.  These \ndepartments are divided into two manufacturing groups, the Engine Manufacturing \nGroup and the Suspension Manufacturing Group.\n\nThe Engine Manufacturing Group:\n\n1. Aluminum Die Cast Department.\n\nIn the Aluminum Die Cast Department, raw aluminum ingots are melted in \naluminum furnaces.  The molten aluminum is then injected into dies either \nby low-pressure casting or by high-pressure casting.  Low pressure casting \nis used to produce engine cylinder heads.  High pressure casting is used to \nproduce engine blocks and transmission casings.\n\n2. Aluminum Machining Department.\n\nEngine blocks and cylinder heads from the Aluminum Die Cast Department \nare machined into finished products for use in the Engine Assembly \nDepartment.  \n\n3. Engine Assembly Department.\n\nThe Engine Assembly Department consists of three assembly lines.  \"0 line\" \nassembles the Civic, Goldwing, and Valkyrie engines.  \"1 line\" assembles \nfour cylinder engines for the Accord and Acura models.  \"2 line\" \nassembles four and six cylinder engines for the Accord and Acura models.\n\nThe Suspension Manufacturing Group:\n\n1. Ferrous Casting Department.\n\nIn the Ferrous Casting Department, scrap metal is melted in a cupola and \npoured into sand molds to form brake disk rotors, brake drums, and \ncylind"

Sulfur \ndioxide, a regulated substance, is used to \"cure\" or harden resin coated sand \ncores used in the \"disk core\" manufacturing process.  Disk cores, in turn are \nused in the formation and molding of cast metal disk brakes.\n\n2. Ferrous Machining Department.\n\nIn the Ferrous Machining Department, the brake disk rotors, brake drums, \nand cylinder sleeves poured in ferrous casting are machined into finished \nproducts.  In addition, inboard, inner, and outboard driveshaft parts are \nforged, machined, and heat-treated.  Crankshafts are also machined and \nheat-treated.  Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance, as well as propane, are used in the \nheat-treating (nitriding) furnace to chemically harden the surface of the \ncrankshafts.\n \n(Note:  Because of a stay of propane applicability issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals on April 27, 1999, Honda's initial June 16, 1999 RMP submittal did not address propane.  In light of the August 1999 amendments to Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act set forth in the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act, and in light of the anticipated dismissal of the stay, Honda has revised its RMP to fully address propane.\n \n3. Suspension Assembly Department.\n\nIn the Suspension Assembly Department, driveshafts are assembled for the \nAccord and Acura models.  Front and rear suspensions are assembled for \nthe Accord, Acura, and Civic models.\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\n(Note:  Because of concerns expressed by various governmental agencies regarding the \npublic availability of hypothetical chemical release scenarios, as expressed in the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act of August 1999, Honda has not \nprovided descriptions of its release scenarios in this Executive Summary.

Sulfur dioxide and anhydrous ammonia, which are used in separate processes, fall into the category of \"regulated toxic substances\".  The third substance, propane, falls under the \"regulated flammable substance\" category.  Consequently, Honda/AEP is submitting in its RMP a worst-case release scenario for sulfur dioxide (which has the greatest calculated distance to an endpoint) and alternative release scenarios for both sulfur dioxide and anhydrous ammonia.  For both regulated toxic substances, an environmental consultant was hired to perform computer modeling to predict the impact areas for the release scenarios.  The consultant used the \"Process Hazard Analysis \nSoftware Tools (PHAST) model, version 5.11, to model both chemicals in a gas state.  Honda is also submitting worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios for propane.  The worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios for propane were established by using EPA published guidance documents for propane storage facilities. \n\n1.    Sulfur Dioxide:\n\nSulfur dioxide is used in the disk core manufacturing process in the ferrous casting \ndepartment.  The disk cores are used in the manufacture of front brake disk rotors \nwhich will be mounted on the Accord, Civic and Acura models.  In this process, \ntwo types of sands and two different resins are first mixed together.  The mixed \ncore sands and resins are then blown into a \"core\" box.  Sulfur dioxide, \nwhich is stored as a liquid in cylinders located in the tank containment room, is \npumped to the core-making machine where it passes through a vaporizer and is \ntransformed into a gas.  A plate is placed over the core box and the sulfur \ndioxide gas is introduced through the plate into the core box to cure the resins.

The ammonia is pumped to the nitriding furnace through a series \nof immersion heaters where the liquid is vaporized into a gas.  Through overhead \npiping, the ammonia vapor travels through a shutoff header stand and a flowmeter \nstand prior to being introduced into the nitriding furnace.  \n\nDue to the high temperature (1,110 degrees Fahrenheit) the ammonia dissociates \ninto its components according to the following reaction:\n\n2 Anhydrous Ammonia -> 2 Nitrogen + 3 Hydrogen\n\nThe nitrogen combines with the alloying elements in the steel to form nitrides.  \nThe nitrides form at the steel surface as a hard chemical layer which will \nminimize wear and fatigue.

Propane:\n\nPropane is used in the nitriding funace to fuel pilot lights and the flame curtains.  The pilot light is associated with an afterburner attached to the furnace exhaust stack, which is used to incinerate off gases emitted by the furnace.  The flame curtains are used to keep oxygen and other gasses from entering the furnace and contaminating the controlled atmosphere within the furnace.  \n\nPropane is also used to react with ammonia within the furnace and the result is the increased surface hardness of the crankshaft.\n\nFor propane, the worst case release scenario was determined through the use of reference tables located in the RMP Guidance Document for Propane Storage Facilities.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for the hypothetical release of propane was also determined by using reference tables located in the RMP Guidance Document for Propane Storage Facilities. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention \nSteps at AEP:\n\nIn addition to being subject to the RMP requirements, Honda/AEP is subject to and \ncomplies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard to prevent \naccidental chemical releases from the disk core manufacturing process and the operation of the \nnitriding furnace.
