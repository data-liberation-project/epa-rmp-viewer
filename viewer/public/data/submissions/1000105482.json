FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Ona Polymers Garland Plant that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n4. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Ona Polymers Garland plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n\n\u00b7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n\n\u00b7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n\n\u00b7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n\n\u00b7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\n\n\u00b7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\n\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\n5. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  \n\nThe company will increase efficiency by leveraging across the businesses most effective technology (MET), standardized work processes defined using Six Sigma, and other best practices. \n\nTo continuously"
