      "SummaryText": "Griffith Micro Science, Inc. (GMSI) submitted the Risk Management Plan on June 18, 1999, in compliance with 40 CFR 68.  Following a detailed annual review of the plan and the facility, it was determined that the off-site consequence analysis submitted in the RMP accounted for an indoor staging area rather than the outdoor staging area that is present at the facility.  GMSI has therefore revised the plan accordingly.  GMSI has also updated the remainder of the submittal as well to account for the recent safety inspection and review, emergency response plan review, and various training activities.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFacilities that use or store more than 10,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the US EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n? Introduction;\n? Facility identification and regulated substances;\n? Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n? Hazard Assessment;\n? Prevention Program;\n? Five-Year Accident History;\n? Emergency Response Plan; and\n? Planned Changes to improve safety\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nGriffith Micro Science, Inc. (GMSI) operates a contract sterilization facility located in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and treatment of spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program regulation (40 CFR 68), i.e. the Risk Management Program.\n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at GMSI.

The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n?

The following paragraphs provide a description of the worst case and alternate scenarios for the facility. \n\nThe RMP regulations define a worst-case release as \"?the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in Sections 68.22 (a)\" (40 CFR 68.3). The worst-case scenario for toxic gases is assumed to be the total release of the single largest container in the process over a 10 minute time period.  Thus, for the GMSI - Charlotte facility it is assumed that 400 lbs. of ethylene oxide is release over a 10 minute time period. The ethylene oxide cylinders are stored in a 3-walled staging area prior to use. The staging area is directly exposed to the surrounding atmosphere therefore it is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinders are release to the atmosphere.  The release rate was then calculated and the distance to endpoint was determined.  This distance is beyond the facility fenceline.  However, based on knowledge of the surrounding area, GMSI has determined that there are no residences within the impact zone.\n\nAlthough GMSI recognizes the maximum potential impacts resulting from a release of ethylene oxide, it believes this scenario to be unlikely.  GMSI has implemented extensive safeguards to prevent such a release such as:  computer controls on all sterilizers, interlock alarms associated with each sterilizer, and installation of process area monitors to detect any leaks.\n\nIn accordance with the US EPA OCAG Document, the al"

      "SummaryText": "ternate scenario evaluated was assumed to consist of a leaking valve on a cylinder of ethylene oxide. The leaking valve results in a release of ethylene oxide to the inside of the building, and the vapor cloud is assumed to travel outside and downwind.  This release is assumed to result from a quarter-inch diameter leak from the valve on a 400-lb. vessel pressurized at 50 psig.  The release rate was determined based on Equation 7-1 in the EPA's OCAG document. The cylinder is assumed to be in use during the leak, therefore a 55% mitigation factor was taken into account resulting from containment within a permanent structure.  The release rate from the building to the outside atmosphere was then calculated and the distance to endpoint was determined.  This distance is beyond the facility fenceline.  However, based on knowledge of the surrounding area, GMSI has determined that there are no residences within the impact zone.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\n1. The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n2. The release must have caused at least one of the following:\n? On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\n? Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nGMSI - Charlotte has not had any accidental releases from the ethylene oxide process within the last five years that meet this definition.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the GMSI - Charlotte facility are coordinated with the Wake County Local Emergency Planning Committee and Steel Creek Fire Department.\n\nDepending on the quantity and chemical involved in a \"reportable spill,\" GMSI - Charlotte a"

Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections and regulatory requirements.  At this time, no further improvements have been identified.  GMSI is in the process of upgrading their safety procedures and training programs.\n\nChemical-Specific Safety\n\nEthylene oxide is stored in an outdoor staging area that is cool, dry, well-ventilated and away from incompatible chemicals and sources of ignition.  Storage containers are insulated and have pressure relief valves. Lower explosive limit (LEL) sensors are located near areas of potential leaks including gas storage areas, gas charging areas, and some of the chamber doors that will alarm with an audible alarm in the event of a major leak from the ethylene oxide cylinders or process."
