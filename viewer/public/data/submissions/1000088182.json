The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during certain portions of the year; the timing is dependent on fishing quotas and seasons.  The plant produces fresh and frozen seafood products. Silver Bay Seafoods- Sitka includes an ammonia refrigeration system that was installed in 2007 (Engine Room #1). Engine Room #2 was installed in 2011. The two systems are separate, each with an individual mechanical room (engine room) containing standard ammonia refrigeration components. The systems are not connected and only System #2 exceeds the threshold amount of ammonia but both are included in the facility safety program.\r\n\r\nChemical of Concern\r\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system to freeze and store seafood products.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \r\nThe facility implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has built in safety fe"

Management is committed to maintaining a safe facility.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \r\n\r\nThere has been one such release at the facility in the past five years. See the RMP Submission for details.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan per 29 CFR 1910.120 to facilitate safe response to potentially uncontrolled ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to  Improve Safety\r\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process, safety meetings, employee suggestions, accident, incident and near-miss investigations, and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades are planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order."
