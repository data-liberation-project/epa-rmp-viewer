The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nEOG Resources Inc. will operate a newly constructed Janus Gas Processing Plant located in the Delaware Basin, Loving County, Texas at coordinates 31.988750\u0094 N, -103.716030\u0094 W (location of the NGL Product Surge Tank (VE-1010)).\n\nEOG Resources has a longstanding commitment to public welfare and worker safety. EOG addresses accidental release prevention through four factors:\n1.Design\n2.Training\n3.Operating parameters, and\n4.Regular maintenance.\n\nThrough design efforts, we have limited public exposure. Through training, we have prepared our personnel to respond effectively. Limiting the operating parameters reduces the stress on process equipment. Regular maintenance serves to prolong equipment life as well as discover potential problems before they become a safety issue.\nShould an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, EOG personnel will evaluate the conditions, take actions within their capabilities to minimize the risk, and notify the appropriate outside agencies.\nNo regulated toxic chemicals (listed in 40 CFR \u00a768.130) will be handled at the facility. The plant will handle flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) type 4 rating. Safety precautions are in place when handling flammable mixtures to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health and safety of personnel, contractors, the community, and the environment.\nThe Janus Gas Processing Plant Emergency Response Plan (ERP) defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance. The ERP includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employ"

All employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures. Janus\u0092s ERP includes procedures for notifying facility personnel, including emergency response personnel, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Loving County Fire Department.\nIn the event of fire, explosion or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.\nFacility Background Information\nJanus Gas Processing Plant is in a rural area in Loving County, Texas. This facility is a natural gas processing plant.\nThe Janus natural gas processing plant is capable of processing 315 MMSCFD of inlet gas with 5% CO2. The plant process consists of an inlet stabilizer system, amine treater, TEG dehydration, and molecular sieve dehydrator beds. The plant separates the NGLs from the natural gas stream through a propane mechanical refrigeration system and RSV cryogenic process. The natural gas enters the plant from high-pressure inlet gathering line(s). The residue gas product can be delivered to multiple lean gas markets and the NGL product can delivered to multiple liquid markets. There is no onsite NGL liquid storage.\nThe facility has been designed in a manner that will minimize the potential for accidental releases from regulated substances.\n\nMarplot indicates that there is no population within the area affected by the worst-case scenario and no residential housing units. However, potential agricultural operations within the area defined by the worst-case scenario endpoint may occur.\nAdditionally, there are no environmental receptors in the worst-case release scenario area.\n\nB.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to Janus management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo determine that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Janus Plant will conduct compliance audits every three years. Janus employs a third party to conduct the audit to ensure impartiality and a fresh perspective. The audit results and any findings are shared with all personnel at a regularly scheduled safety event. In addition, the final report is available at the Control Room for reference.\nAll audit findings are corrected in a timely fashion based upon priority ranking.
