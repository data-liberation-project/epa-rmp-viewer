      "SummaryText": "The Northampton Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) at 33 Hockanum Road in Northampton, Massachusetts is a publicly owned treatment facility. Gaseous chlorine is used by the facility to disinfect wastewater prior to discharge. The  Northampton WWTP stores more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine at its Northampton facility, therefore, the plant is required to address the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 (Risk Management Program).\n\n\n\nThe Northampton WWTP currently stores up to 16,000 pounds of chlorine in eight, one-ton containers (although inventory is typically maintained to a maximum of 12,000 pounds).  The chlorine is stored and processed in a dedicated building located at the wastewater treatment plant site.  The goal of 40 CFR Part 68 is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) required EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. Part 68 is that rule.  The phrase \"Risk Management Program\" refers to all of the requirements of Part 68, which must be met on an on-going basis. The phrase \"Risk Management Plan (RMP)\" refers to the management system document maintained by the facility as well as the registration information submitted to EPA (RMP Submit).\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (Plan) developed by the Northampton WWTP contains the policies and procedures used at the Northampton WWTP to maintain continued compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program.  The Plan is available for review by employees at any time and employees are encouraged to review the policies and procedures contained within the Plan.  Any recommendation to improve the Plan's accuracy or effectiveness in assuring employee, visitor and con"

The Management System section of the Plan discusses various duties that are assigned in order to fulfill the intent of the Plan.  The Management System section also describes the employee responsibilities associated with each duty.\n\n\n\nA major component of the Plan is the assessment of impact associated with the accidental release of the applicable hazardous materials, or a Hazard Assessment.  The Hazard Assessment section of the Plan summarizes both the anticipated worst-case release as well as alternative release scenarios that are specific to the site.  An Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) has been conducted for the facility which focuses on the impact to neighboring areas called receptors. \n\n\n\nSafety Information, including information related to the safety of a process, has been collected and is maintained or referenced in the Plan.  Safety Information maintained by the facility includes:  hazards of the chemicals, maximum intended inventory, safe operating limits, equipment specifications, and applicable codes and standards.  This information is used as a reference during Hazard Reviews.  Information pertaining to the hazards of the regulated chemical (chlorine) is found primarily in Safety Data Sheets (SDS), which are available to facility personnel.\n\n\n\nHazard Reviews are a systematic approach to evaluating the safety of a process.  The Northampton WWTP uses a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) approach to identify the hazards of the process, previous incidents having potential for serious consequences, engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors and an evaluation of the range of exposures if controls fail.  PHA's for the facility follow a standard methodology, such as a What If/Checklist Analysis and are performed by a cross-functional team with at least one person who is famili"

A system for addressing, resolving, documenting and communicating all recommendations in a prompt manner is in place.\n\n\n\nThe first PHA performed under the RMP program for the Northampton WWTP was conducted on November 17, 2000.  Subsequent PHAs have been conducted, as required under the Risk Management Program provisions.  PHA action items are documented and tracked to completion.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures are instructions that outline how to safely operate the process consistent with Safety Information for the process.  The Northampton WWTP has developed Operating Procedures for each operating phase (initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operation, normal shutdown and startup after a normal or emergency shutdown or a major change).  Procedures are accessible top facility personnel and maintained current and up to date.\n\n\n\nInitial training is provided to employees involved with the Risk Management Program processes that covers an overview of the process, specific safety and health hazards, operating procedures and emergency operations.  Refresher training is provided periodically that covers understanding and adherence to current operating procedures.  Records are kept to document that employees have received and understood the training. \n\n\n\nWritten procedures have been developed for maintaining the ongoing mechanical integrity of process equipment.  The mechanical integrity program applies to pressure vessels and storage tanks; piping systems and their components; relief and vent systems and associated devices; emergency shutdown systems; controls (sensors, alarms, interlocks); and pumps.  Employees involved with mechanical integrity are trained in an overview of the process and in specifics of their assigned job tasks.  Inspection/testing is performed using generally recognized and accepted good engineering practices, at a frequency consistent with manufacturer's "

The Compliance Audits and certifications involve verifying that procedures and practices for Risk Management Program elements are adequate and are being followed.  Compliance Audits for the Northampton WWTP are performed by a team, with at least one person who is knowledgeable in the process.  Reports are generated for each Compliance Audit and recommendations are tracked to completion.\n\n\n\nA formal Incident Investigation is required for any incident that could, or did result in a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical.  The investigation must begin within 48 hours of the incident and must identify the chain of events, cause(s) of the incident and corrective measures that can be implemented.  An Incident Investigation report must be developed and recommendations must be communicated and addressed in a timely manner.  The Northampton WWTP has not experienced an incident which has required a formal incident investigation in this RMP submission cycle.\n\n\n\nThe Northampton WWTP has developed an Emergency Action Plan which includes procedures for handling small releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Emergency Action Plan additionally includes emergency evacuation procedures; procedures for employees who remain to operate critical equipment; procedures to account for personnel; rescue and medical duties; means of reporting emergencies; and a list of persons or departments who can answer any questions.  Employees have been trained in the hazards of chlorine and the relevant elements of the Emergency Action Plan.
