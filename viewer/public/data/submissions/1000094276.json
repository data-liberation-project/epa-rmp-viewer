Two entrepreneurs opened Albemarle, Tyrone Plant for business in 1976.  In 1986, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was bought by First Chemical Company of Pascagoula, MS.  First Chemical Company is a subsidiary of First Mississippi Corporation, who was restructured under the name of ChemFirst Inc. in late 1996. Albemarle Corporation purchased the site in July of 2001.  WR Grace purchased the site on June 1, 2021. \n\n\n\nThe facility is designed for maximum flexibility and is continuously upgraded to ensure safe operation, minimal waste, and top efficiency.  We have more than 80,000 gallons of reactor capacity and a complete range of solids handling equipment.  The plant is especially well equipped for complex, multi-step synthesis.  WR Grace, Tyrone Plant's production operations consist of the batch production of specific and finite campaigns to produce chemicals for our customers.\n\n\n\nThe facility's Quality and Environmental management systems are ISO 9001 (Quality) and RC 14001 (Environmental and Safety) registered.\n\n\n\nFACILITY POLICIES FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE\n\n\n\nCompany environmental and safety/health policy statements stress the importance of protecting the safety and health of our employees as well as that of the community and the public.  \"The world's natural resources of air, water, and land are finite and must be conserved and protected.  Life and health are precious and must be safeguarded.  These beliefs compel us to conduct our business in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees and the public....\"  \"The personal safety and health of each employee of this company and the ge"

These chemicals and their maximum intended inventory levels are: anhydrous ammonia, 77,000 pounds; diethyl ether 40,000 pounds; and chlorine 22,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a gas delivered by truck and maintained in pressurized tanks.  Diethyl ether is stored in tanker trucks, and chlorine is stored in one ton cylinders.    In addition to minimizing the inventory of these and other chemicals that are needed for our production operations, we also try to remove the chemicals from our site when they are no longer needed for a production campaign.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenarios have been modeled for anhydrous ammonia, ethyl ether, and chlorine.  An alternative release scenario has also been modeled for each substance as well. Some of the releases have off-site impact. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia for the worst-case scenario the pressurized tanks leaks and releases 77,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia  (the entire contents of the pressurized tank) in 10 minutes.  This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\n\n\n\nFor diethyl ether the tanker fails and releases 40,000 pounds of diethyl ether (the entire contents of the tanker) in 10 minutes. A vapor cloud explosion occurs. This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\n\n\n\n \n\nFor chlorine, the cylinder fails and releases 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas (the entire contents of the cylinder) in 10 minutes.
