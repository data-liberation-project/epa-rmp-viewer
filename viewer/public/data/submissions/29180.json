The purpose of this RMP is to:\n\n  Increase the protection of public health and the environment by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling an acutely hazardous material (AHM).\n\n  Assist Driscoll Strawberry Assoc. Inc. and the local governmental agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling an AHM.\n\nThis document addresses the existing AHM system used for the produce refrigeration process at the Driscoll Strawberry Assoc. Inc. facility.  The AHM used at the facility and for the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia.  The devices that circulate and store the ammonia will be the subject of investigation throughout this RMP document.\n\n Driscoll Strawberry Assoc. Inc. is located within the city limits of Salinas, California, in a predominately business/industrial area, and is a produce pre-cooling, cold storage, and shipping facility.   The facility was first constructed on this site in 1984 and has been in continuous seasonal operation since that time.   Anhydrous ammonia is used as the closed loop system refrigerant for the 29,300 sq ft cold storage warehouse and pre-cooling equipment in an amount of approximately 5000 lbs., and is the only acutely hazardous chemical used on the site.   The balance of the facility located on the approximate 5 acre paved site consists of a 15,000 sq ft storage warehouse.   \nThe risks to the community from this facility would come fr"

      "SummaryText": "om an incident in which the ammonia normally contained within the plant refrigeration system was allowed to escape into the atmosphere.   In the worst-case scenario the toxic end point is located off the property within the community.  The alternate release scenario was selected as the most likely event that could have a toxic endpoint located off of the subject property.   Events which were considered possible and able to cause a release of ammonia for the purposes of the Hazard Review were:  equipment failure, operator error, design deficiency, vehicular accident, and acts of sabotage/vandalism, fire and earthquake.   It is expected that other specific events would have similar results as those listed above.   Direct contact with the released ammonia vapor by people inside the toxic endpoint is the main area of concern.\n       The worst-case release scenario considered was as required, specifically being the release of 100% of the ammonia contained within the largest vessel over a 10-minute period.   The analytical results of this scenario show a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately .83 miles, which includes mainly industrial development, agricultural land, and a smaller amount of residential area.   The alternative release scenario was chosen as the most likely event involving the release of 300 lbs. of ammonia over a 30-minute period from a leaking valve or cracked pipe.   The distance to the toxic endpoint would be less than .1 miles in this case.   Both scenarios can result in off-site impacts.\n\n\nAdministrative controls and policies:   to be used in the event of a release are contained in the existing \" Business Response Plans and Procedures - 2003\".   The major topics covered by this document are:\n               1.  Emergency Response Personnel\n               2.  Hazard Assessment\n               3. Notification Procedures\n               4.

The essential risk reduction steps now in effect at this facility are:\n               1.   Regular daily equipment observations\t\t\n               2.

See Appendix.\n\nUtility System:\nThis facility is connected to PG&E and is subject to possible power failures.  The failure of a refrigeration system to operate during a power outage poses no risk of an ammonia release since loss of power simply stops the flow of ammonia within the system.   In the event of a post-earthquake fire at the site, water for firefighting and/or ammonia dilution is drawn from the city water system.  The post-earthquake functionality of the water system thus depends on the vulnerability of PG&E and the water system to earthquake induced failure, which is unknown.\n\nRecommended plant improvements to increase safety.      \n             1.   Provide pipe labeling as per UMC and ANSI/ASHRAE standards.\n             2.   Replace PRV's on 5 year cycles as per code\n             3.
