      "SummaryText": "In May 2000, the City of Oak Ridge assumed ownership and operations of the Y-12 Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The WTP had been previously owned by the U.S. Department of Energy and operated by East Tennessee Mechanical Contractors (ETMC). The water system is comprised of three subsystems that include the raw water supply system, the water treatment system and the treated water distribution system.  The system provides water for potability, cooling, process and fire protection needs to approximately 29,000 residents, as well as a host of commercial and government activities at the Y-12 and ORNL Plant sites.   Any interruption in continuous water service will have an immediate harmful impact on plant operations.   The water system is also important to public health and the economic stability of the City of Oak Ridge.  Chlorine, a regulated substance, is used for disinfection purposes in the production of potable water.  The approximate daily usage of chlorine is 170 to 350 pounds.  Usually six (6) one-ton containers are stored at the WTP.  Although many of the stored containers have been used and are empty, two containers are on line at all times.  The WTP uses an average of 1.5 cylinders per week.  Annual chlorine usage is approximately 85,000 pounds.  Chlorine is a yellow-greenish gas with a characteristic penetrating and irritating odor that is highly toxic.   Gas leaks can pose a health hazard to employees and the public and may possibly interrupt water treatment service.  Overexposure to chlorine can cause irritation to the throat and lungs and prolonged exposure can result in death.  Emergency response and process safety management plans have been developed that are intended to minimize the health risks to employees and the public from the accidental release of chlorine.  The programs provide information on the hazardous properties of chlorine, delineate the area at risk in case of an accidental chlorine release and outline prevention and response procedures des"

      "SummaryText": "igned to minimize the threat to health and environment in the area of consequence.  The PSM/RMP specifies the responsibilities that each person involved with the chlorine process and hazard mitigation has.  In the last five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine on site.  However, WTP personnel have been taught to handle only very minor leaks when changing out chlorine cylinders.  Otherwise, WTP personnel will, in the event of a major leak that activates the alarm system, activate a notfication system to warn the public, the D.O.E. plant personnel and other on-site personnel for the purposes of either evacation or on-site sheltering.  First aid to victims of chlorine exposure is taught to all WTP operators.  The Oak Ridge Fire Department response teams as well as the emergency response teams of the Y-12 National Security Complex will be the primary off-site responders handling all major leaks and providing more advanced medical aid to victims of chlorine gas/liquid exposure.  These emergency response teams will be notified immediately in case of a major release by the calling of the \"911\" telephone number and/or by the City wide radio system.  All personnel that handle chlorine are thoroughly trained prior to operations involving potential chlorine exposure. Designs are being finalized to replace the gaseous chlorine disinfection system with a sodium hypochlorite system thus eliminating the water treatment plant from having RMP/PSM threshold quantities."
