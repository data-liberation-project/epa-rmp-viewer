      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) owns and operates a municipal water treatment facility in the Village of Bee Cave, Travis County, Texas.  This facility is the West Travis County Regional Water Treatment Plant (WTCRWTP).  LCRA has reviewed its obligations under the USEPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act).  In response to these requirements, LCRA notes that there are two obligations incumbent on the operations at the WTCRWTP facility. \n\n1.\t\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00b1112(r) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  LCRA takes this obligation very seriously and intends to be not only a good neighbor but also a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness.\n2.\tRisk Management Plan - LCRA operates a water treatment facility that stores and uses chlorine in excess of thresholds specified in the RMP Rule.  Even prior to the promulgation of the RMP rule, LCRA management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by storage and use of chlorine.  LCRA has established programs to prevent any accidental releases and provides training for emergency response in the event of a release. These programs are documented and described in the Risk Management Plan. \n\nLCRA has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate any chlorine release.  A new chemical storage building was completed and put into service in April 2006.  This building is blast-proof and provides a leak-tight atmosphere in case of a chlorine release.  A fixed media dry scrubber is capable of treating a release from one 1-ton chlorine cylinder with no discharge to the atmosphere.  The air in the chlorine storage room is continually monitored electronically for chlorine gas and a release"

If the chlorine level in the stack gets to 5 ppm, then the stack is automatically closed and the chlorine remains in the building.\n\nIn addition to maintenance, training and inspection procedures, LCRA has an active monitoring and alarm system that will detect a release and sound a local alarm.  An emergency alarm is triggered when the chlorine level in the atmosphere is above 1 part per million (ppm).  When the chlorine level is above 3 ppm, an AutoDialer begins calling the Water and Wastewater Operations personnel and the Public Safety Communications Center.  LCRA has coordinated with local emergency responders including the  Lake Travis Fire Rescue Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nLCRA management is committed to:\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tPreventing accidents;\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tTraining our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tProviding leadership to the community with respect to emergency preparedness;\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tAddressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with facility operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and \n\u00c2\u00bfX\tBeing a good corporate citizen of Travis County\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan provides information about LCRA's management of the risks associated with the chlorine water treatment process, but more importantly, stresses LCRA's commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors and our community.\n \nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe West Travis County Regional Water Treatment Plant is located at 12215 Bee Caves Road in Bee Cave, Texas.  The facility uses chlorine for disinfection purposes.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders inside a blast-proof concrete building.  Up to 10 chlorine cylinders can be stored inside the building.  The cylinders are delivered and temporaril"

The chlorine is injected into the water system through a vacuum injection piping system.\n\nThe atmosphere in the building is continuously monitored by four separate monitors in the chlorine storage room and one monitor in the chlorine feed room.  An alarm is initiated if chlorine is detected at 1 ppm.  If the chlorine increases to 3 ppm, then an exhaust fan automatically routes the air in the chlorine storage and feed rooms to a dry fixed media scrubber, which is capable of treating a one-ton cylinder.  Additionally, at 3 ppm an alarm activates an autodialer that calls out the following sequence until someone acknowledges the alarm: On-call operator cell phone, Public Safety Dispatch, and the Senior Water Utility Control Technician.  A monitor in the scrubber stack monitors the chlorine level released to the atmosphere.  If the chlorine level in the stack reaches 5 ppm, then the stack automatically closes and the chlorine remains in the building.\n\nThe West Travis County Regional Water Treatment Plant chlorine process is subject to Program 2 requirements of Section 112(r), which is the default program when the process is ineligible for either Program 1 or Program 3.\n \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY AND OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\nThere has not been an accidental chlorine release in the last five years. \n\nThe five year accident history must be revised and a corrected RMP submitted to EPA if there are any accidental chlorine releases that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  EPA defines injury, in 40 CFR 68.3, as \"any effect on a human that results either from direct exposure to toxic concentrations; radiant heat; or overpressures from accidental releases or from the direct consequences of a vapor cloud explosion (such as flying glass, debris, an"

Although the chlorine will be primarily stored inside a leak-tight building that would mitigate releases to the outside, there are times that the chlorine cylinders will be stored outside.  Therefore, LCRA considers the worst-case release scenario to occur outside the building with no mitigation.\n\nAccording to EPA's Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (July 2004), the worst-case release scenario must be assumed to occur at ground level and the toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l (3 ppm).  This results in a distance to the toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles in an urban setting (per Exhibit F-3 of the Guidance).  The 1.3-mile toxic endpoint is represented as a circle with a 1.3 mile radius centered on the chlorine storage building.  According to a previous Risk Management Plan done by ENSR in 2004 for the WTCRWTP, the population within the circle is 1,488 persons.  ENSR used the estimation method outlined in Section 4.4 of EPA's General Risk Management Program Guidance (April 2004) to estimate the population.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Off"

      "SummaryText": "site Consequence Analysis\n\nUnder Section 112(r), an alternative release scenario is intended to correspond to events that can reasonably be expected to occur.  LCRA has conservatively defined its alternative release scenario to be a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through a 5/16-inch diameter valve body opening.  This release consists of approximately 317 pounds of chlorine, per a previous Risk Management Plan done by Zephyr Environmental Corporation in 1999 for the WTCRWTP.  This chlorine would be treated by the scrubber, which is rated for treating 2,000 pounds of chlorine, and should result in minimal release of chlorine to the atmosphere.  Therefore, LCRA does not believe that any chlorine would be emitted offsite during this alternative release scenario.\n \nHAZARD REVIEW\n\nEPA requires that the Hazard Review be updated at least once every five years. The Hazard Review was updated on December 7, 2010. The review prior to this was completed on January 13, 2006. Members of Operations, Environmental and Safety participated in the Hazard Review, and a copy of that review and the previous review are contained in Appendix 1. There have been no significant changes in the operational process to require a Hazard Review.\n\nNote: EPA requires that the Hazard Review be updated at least once every five years.  Additionally, EPA requires that reviews must be conducted whenever a major change in the process occurs.  All issues identified in the review shall be resolved before startup of the changed process.\n\n\n \nOPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE\n\nEPA regulations require that operations and maintenance procedures be written down and kept onsite.  The West Travis County Regional Water Treatment Plant has operations and maintenance manuals for the chlorine injection system and the chlorine scrubber system.  Copies of these manuals are included in Appendix 2.  In addition, copies of Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams for the West Travis Count"

If any repairs are required based on the monthly inspection, a separate preventative maintenance Work Order is generated and a contractor performs the required repairs.  An additional preventative maintenance Work Order is generated annually for a contractor to inspect, repair, and replace chlorine system equipment.\nAs part of the Audit and resubmission process, preventative maintenance Work Orders were reviewed and updated by Operations in December of 2010.\n\nNote: EPA requires that operating procedures must be updated, if necessary, whenever a major change occurs and prior to start-up of the changed process. \n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nSection 112(r) requires a regulated facility to either provide emergency response for a release, coordinate with local emergency responders, or a combination of the two methods.  LCRA has coordinated with Lake Travis Fire Rescue Department to respond in an emergency to a release of chlorine.  Lake Travis Fire Rescue will have overall command of the emergency, will setup a decontamination area and will provide a Safety Officer to enter the exclusion zone. Properly-trained LCRA personnel will enter the exclusion zone and locate the source of the release and repair it.  An Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the West Travis County Regional Water Treatment Plant has been written and includes detailed procedures on how to respond to a chlorine release.  Personnel have been trained on the ERP and a copy of this plan is kept at the facility.  The official copy of the ERP is kept on the Electronic Document Management System.\n \nTRAINING\n\nTraining is provided to all new or transferred employees operating and/or maintaining the chlorine system at the West Travis County Regional Water Treatment Plant.

The operations personnel and the maintenance personnel are given training on how to safely operate and maintain the chlorine injection equipment; how to appropriately respond to a release; and how the scrubber operates.  This training is provided initially, when any process or procedure is changed and annually for refresher training.\n\nIn addition to the West Travis County Chlorine Safety Training described above and documented on RMP Form 1 included in Appendix 3, new Operators at the West Travis County Regional Water Treatment Plant are provided with On the Job Training by Operators that have been previously trained and that are experienced with operating the West Travis County chlorine system.  After sufficient On the Job Training is provided by the experienced Operators, new West Travis County employees operate the chlorine system only under the direct supervision of experienced Operators until such time as the West Travis County Area Supervisor believes they are competent to independently operate the system in a safe manner.  RMP Form 2 in Appendix 3 documents On the Job Training and Operator competency. \n\nOperators receive classroom training on the contents of the West Travis County Regional ERP annually; the last training was conducted in November 2009 and the next training will be in April 2011.
