In this Tampa Port Services distribution facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA. The same properties that make anhydrous ammonia valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our employees and site workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations, and we are committed to conducting business and operating our facilities in a manner designed to protect the environment, and the health and safety of our employees, and our neighbors around the Ammonia Terminal.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\r\n\r\nThe Hooker's Point Ammonia Terminal serves as a vital link in supplying ammonia to its own manufacturing facilities and other customers.  Hooker's Point receives refrigerated anhydrous ammonia from ships at the Port of Tampa's unloading dock.  Ammonia is pumped from the ship to a low pressure storage tank where the ammonia is refrigerated and stored at -28 \u00b0F.  Truck and rail loading facilities are on site to load ammonia from the storage tank for transfer to Mosaic's manufacturing facility and other customers.  Hooker's Point may also transfer ammonia via a privately owned pipeline for delivery to Mosaic facilities.  The only substance regulated under EPA's RMP requirements at the facility is ammonia. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices:\r\n\r\nHooker's Point has an extensive safety program to ensure compliance with all applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations.  The facility operates under a Corporate Environmental Health and Safety Policy that endorses going beyond regulatory requirements when necessar"

The design, maintenance and operation of the facility are carried out in conformance with this policy to provide a safe operation and to prevent exposures of our employees and nearby neighbors to ammonia.  Management at the Hooker's Point Ammonia Terminal is responsible for the development and implementation of programs and procedures to ensure conformance with this philosophy.  The programs and procedures are continually reviewed and updated, and the facility is periodically audited to assure compliance. \r\n\r\nTampa Port Services personnel are also trained in key aspects of emergency response.  The facility's Emergency Response Plan is based on OSHA's emergency response standard, 29 CFR 1910.120(q). The plan includes procedures for the notification of local fire and emergency response authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  The facility is linked to a community alarm that provides emergency notification to nearby neighbors.  In addition, emergency preparedness is assured by:  Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) trained operators and supervisory personnel; emergency response drills with local emergency responders; ammonia sensors located at critical locations in the process area and along the facility perimeter; continuous computer monitoring of ammonia sensor readings and weather conditions; and water spray systems for ammonia vapor suppression.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe Hooker's Point Ammonia Terminal is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  As recognized by EPA, the PSM standard forms the basis for the agency's RMP prevention program component.  The primary purpose of this facility's PSM program is to safeguard employees and nearby neighbors from exposure to ammonia by providing assistance in evaluating and updating the facility's process and mechanical safety procedures and programs."

In the past five years there have been no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or off site impacts resulting in sheltering in place, evacuation, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nHAZMAT training is performed in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and pre-emergency planning and drills are conducted with local emergency responders.  The emergency response program complies with the OSHA PSM Program as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.119.  The HAZMAT team conducts joint training and drills with the local fire department.  Facility personnel conduct meetings informing the public of the facility's Emergency Response Program.
