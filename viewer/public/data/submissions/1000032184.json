Arctic Glacier's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Plant Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP Program.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Arctic Glacier facility is located at 2003 South Cherry Avenue in Fresno, California, which is located approximately 0.4 miles east of Highway 41 and 2 miles south of Highway 180. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The original construction was in 1917, but the refrigeration system was overhauled in 1997 and major modifications were made in 2008. The ownership transfer of the ammonia refrigeration system was completed in December 2007.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  \n\nThe primary business of Arctic Glacier is the production and storage of ice. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 14,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the production and storage of ice.  Typical operating conditions range from 15 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 165 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn ord"

IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins \"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nThe Arctic Glacier ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTO"

      "SummaryText": "RY\n\n\n\nIt was noted during the August 23, 2012 PHA that there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the past five years (August 2007-August 2012).  However, the facility did have an ammonia release that resulted in a release of less than one gallon of ammonia on March 24, 2009.  While performing the daily system inspection, a maintenance employee smelled ammonia near the high pressure liquid line on the roof.  Another maintenance employee was called to investigate.  The facility contacted their refrigeration contractor (NH3 PLUS, Inc.).  The main liquid line was isolated and pumped down.  Insulation was removed and a crack (fracture) in the seam was found.  The section of the pipe was removed and replaced with a seamless pipe.  It was determined that the root cause of the incident was corrosion of the pipe under the insulation.  The facility replaced 315 feet of piping as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Arctic Glacier facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.  To save lives.\n\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.

Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) and PHA Revalidations, which included a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, generated mitigation measures to improve safety at the Arctic Glacier facility located in Fresno, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Arctic Glacier safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4.
