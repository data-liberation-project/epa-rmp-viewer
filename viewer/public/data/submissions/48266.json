The Process Safety Management plan includes the following:                                                                                                                 1. A written plan of action for implementing employee consultation on the development of process hazard analyses and other elements of process hazard management contained within 1910.119.                                                  2. Compiled written process safety information on process chemical chlorine, process technology, and process equipment before conducting the process hazard analysis.                                                                                                     3. Developed a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating and controlling processes involving chlorine.                                       4. Developed operating procedures addressing steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.                                                                                                5.

The West Wilson Utility District Water Treatment Plant treats water from Old Hickory Lake which is part of the Cumberland River System for distribution to the public as potable water.  The West Wilson Utility District Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine in the treatment process as an oxidizing agent and a disinfectant. Chlorine is stored in the Chlorine Room in ton containers both as gas and as a pressurized liquid.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton containers and mixed with potable water with chlorinators which are also located in the Chlorine Room.  The chlorine/water solution is then piped to the application points, which include two influent pipes that supply eight filters, these pipes are located in the basement of the water treatment plant, and the mixing chamber located underneath the chlorine room.\n\nChlorine is identified as a regulated toxic substance Table 1 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 Subpart F.  West Wilson Utility District Water Treatment Plant stores up to (six - one ton cylinders) 12,000 pounds of chorine on-site, which is more than the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds (?40 CFR 68.130).  West Wilson Utility District Water Treatment Plant has implemented a Risk Management Program for the chlorine process in accordance with the requirements of ?40 CFR 68.  The objective of the Risk Management Program is to identify the hazards that may result from accidental releases of chlorine, to ensure that the facility is designed and operated in a safe manner to prevent accidental releases of chlorine, and to minimize the consequences of any accidental releases which may occur. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe West Wilson Utility District Water Treatment Plant has evaluated a worst-case release scenario in accordance with the requirements of ?40 CRF 68.25.

      "SummaryText": "s defined a worst-case release as, ?a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.?  The release is assumed to occur instantaneously.  The possible causes of the release or the probability that such a release might occur is not considered in the worst-case scenario analysis; the release is simply assumed to take place.  \n\nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L as published in Appendix A to Part 68 ? Table of Toxic Endpoints.  The toxic endpoint is the maximum airborne concentration which is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serous health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.\n\nThe largest single storage vessel for chlorine at the West Wilson Utility District Water Treatment Plant is 2000 pounds. For the worst-case scenario, it is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released at ground level.  The chlorine is assumed to be released over a ten minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of the impact area is estimated to be 1.3 miles, having an urban topography, as calculated by the RMP Comp software provided by EPA website.  The population within the impact area is estimated to be 2,959 persons.  Additionally, it is noted that schools, residences, recreational areas, and state wildlife management areas are located with in the impact area. \n\nThe meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined by EPA Guidance as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour), and ambient air temperature of 25 degrees C.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe West Wilson Utility District Water Treatment Plant has also evaluated an alternative release scenario in accordance with the requirements of ?40 CFR 68.28.

      "SummaryText": "elease scenario selected is a vessel leak. The alternative release scenario is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario. However, written operating procedures are in place for the safe operation of the ton containers, and the probability of this type release is very low.  Employees are assumed to detect the release and stop the release using the Emergency ?B? Kit in one hour.  The release rate to the Chlorine Room is estimated to be fifteen pounds per minute.  This would result in a total quantity of nine hundred pounds of chlorine released. Since the chlorine is release inside the Chlorine Room and the building should have a mitigating effect on the release rate, it is assumed that the release rate to the atmosphere will be less than fifteen pounds per minute. It has been assumed that the release rate to the atmosphere will be fifty five percent of the release rate inside the building which is 15 pounds per minute.  This results in a release rate to the atmosphere of eight and on quarter pounds per minute.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is estimated to be two tenths of a mile as calculated by the RMPComp software provided by EPA website.  The population within the alternative release scenario impact area is estimated to be 127 persons.  There are no environmental receptors located within the impact area.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThroughout the life of the chlorine process at the West Wilson Utility District Water Treatment Plant, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage. Also, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the facility that have resulted in off-site deaths, Injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe West Wilson Utility District Water Treatment Plant has implemented a prevention program in accordance with ?40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D and the Occupational Safety and Healt"
