The facility is equipped with a refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S. #7664-41-7. Ammonia is the sole regulated substance with regard to the aforementioned regulations.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the system is 13,917 pounds.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls inlcude automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded. Adminsitrative controls involve manual isolation and shudown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.\n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nNone to report.   \n\n\n\nEmergency Action Plan\n\nAll employees are trained in the emergency action plan annually. Drills are performed on a regular basis. Employees are trained to act based on their pre-assigned roles during emergency situations.  The New Orleans Fire Department is called and responds in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nOngoing training of operators, inspection and testing of equipment and preventative maintenance of the system components have been implemented to improve safety.  \n\nAn ammonia detection and monitoring system was installed to detect and shut down the system if necessary in the event of a leak.  An ammonia diffusion tank was also installed and the safety relief vent lines piped into the water that would contain the ammonia in the water in the event of a safety relief valve discharg"
