Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Brighton) are\n     committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and\n     propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the\n     local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the\n     release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for saale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct\n     application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n     Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one 18,000-gallon storage tank.  Anhydrous\n     Ammonia is also stored in 30-1000 gal wagons for another 130,050 pounds.  The\n     maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 208,080 pounds.  Propane is\n     stored in one 30,000 tank and the maximum quanitity of propane stored would be\n     94,400 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n     a.     The worst-case scenerio for each would be the release of the total contents\n             of each tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.\n\n             Anhydrous ammonia - The maximum quantity released would be 78,030 pounds,\n             which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as\n             limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion of\n             the gas to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.1 miles.\n\n             Propane - The maximum quantity released would be 94,400 pounds, which\n             represents the voulme of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limit"

The endpoint\n             represents the lateral extent of a pressure wave of 1 psi overpressure from an\n             assumed explosion of the gas.\n\n     b.     The alternate release scenarios, based on the most likely potential, or the\n             five-year accident history, are:\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia - A release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose, lasting 2\n             minutes before automatic or manual shut-off intervenes to stop the flow.  The\n             maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds.  The distance to the \n             endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n             Propane - A release from a hose rupture in a 4-inch hose 25-feet long caused by a\n             pull-away.  The active mitigation devices are assumed to work as designed,\n             limiting the release to the contents of the hose, a maximum of 69 pounds.  The\n             distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with applicable standards for\n     storage  and handling of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  The standards for anhydrous\n     ammonia include the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling\n     of Anhydrous Ammonia, k-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc.\n     (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n     (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI\n     Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrtive Code Part 21-Chapter 43-\n     Rule 43.6(200)- Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n     The applicable standard for propane is National Fire Protection Association Standard 58\n     \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquified Petroleum Gases"

Five-Year Accident History.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five\n     years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility;\n     nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\n     place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The Facility has:\n\n     a.     a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38:\n\n     b.     provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community\n             right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\n     performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific\n     safety recommendations regarding storaage or use of anhydrous ammonia and propane\n     for implementation at this time."
