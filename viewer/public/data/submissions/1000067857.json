As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Del Monte Fresh has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Del Monte Fresh, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Del Monte Fresh has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program.

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils.

The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe pumped overfeed system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator. From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator. Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.

Nevertheless, Del Monte Fresh continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Del Monte Fresh's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Del Monte Fresh's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nDel Monte Fresh has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Del Monte Fresh has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Del Monte Fresh now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Del Monte Fresh employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Del Monte Fresh will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety.\n\n"
