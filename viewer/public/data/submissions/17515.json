At a minimum, employees will: (1) participate in the development of the site specific RMP programs and will participate in their implementation, (2) participate in conducting the chlorine, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide process hazard analysis, (3) be trained annually on the RMP programs and any changes made to the program systems or processes, (4) will work with management to develop additional programs or procedures relative to chlorine, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide process safety as needed, and (5) participate in the periodic audits of the RMP Program. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWoodward Iodine Corporation (WIC) believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nWIC has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release.  The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations. \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances.\n\nThe WIC Facility utilizes chlorine, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide in the iodine extraction process.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.\n\n Chemical         "

It is WIC's philosophy to continually improve the safe working conditions of its employees to minimize accidents and reduce the potential for either an on-site or off-site release.  With this in mind, WIC is planning on incorporating many of the RMP elements into other areas of the process not covered under 40 CFR 68 to improve the overall safety of the plant."
