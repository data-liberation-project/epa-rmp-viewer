      "SummaryText": "NewPage Corporation's Luke Mill in Luke Maryland, has been a proud and responsible member of the Allegany County community since 1888.  During this time, the Luke Mill has safely converted millions of tons of pulp wood into Fine Paper.  Operations at the Luke Mill include debarking, chipping, pulping, bleaching, paper coating production, paper making, and paper finishing.  In addition to producing paper, the Luke Mill operates three power boilers to produce steam and electric for use at the facility, and operates a water filtration plant to produce drinking water for the mill and the town of Luke.\n\nOn June 20, 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency published the final rule for its Risk Management Program (RMP).  This regulation is designed to assist facilities and communities in their efforts to reduce the number and severity of serious chemical accidents.  The EPA formally developed a final list of regulated substances, with threshold storage quantities established for each substance.  This list includes 77 toxics and 63 flammable substances.\n\nOnly two regulated substances are handled at the Luke Mill in excess of their applicable threshold quantities.  Chlorine dioxide has been used at the mill since 1958.  It is produced at the Luke Mill's new (1997) state of the art R8 Chlorine Dioxide Plant and is used to bleach the raw pulp.  Chlorine is used at the Water Filtration Plant to disinfect drinking water for the mill and for the residents of the town of Luke.  Sulfur Dioxide use has been discontinued and replaced with a \"baghouse\"  collection system to help control particulate emissions.\n\nEach facility which stores a chemical above its threshold quantity is required to prepare one worst-case release scenario analysis.  In addition, an alternative release scenario must be prepared for each chemical.  By using the information from these Hypothetical Release Scenarios, the Luke Mill, working with the Local Emergency Planning committees and local fire departments, h"

      "SummaryText": "as developed emergency response plans and training procedures.\n\nThe Worst Case Release scenario is for chlorine dioxide and consists of the catastrophic failure of a storage tank and associated piping with the release of 15,200 lbs of chlorine dioxide spreading within a diked area.  This hypothetical release would result in offsite chlorine dioxide concentrations that equal or exceed the EPA's designated endpoint concentration.  The environmental and public receptors include a state forest, wildlife management area, public recreation areas, residences, schools, hospitals, commercial facilities, office buildings, and churches.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide consists of the release of 75 pounds of chlorine dioxide solution, as a result of a pipeline breakage downstream of a storage tank.  This hypothetical release would result in chlorine dioxide concentrations that equal or exceed the EPA's designated endpoint concentration of 2.8 x 10-6 kg/m3, from the point of release out to a distance of 0.85 miles.  The following public receptors are within this distance from the point of release: schools; residences; hospitals; recreation areas; and commercial, office, or industrial areas.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for chlorine consists of the release of 0.1 pounds of chlorine over a duration of 5 minutes from the breakage of a pipeline due to a crane dropping a cylinder on a common line connected to three chlorine cylinders in the chlorine storage building.  This hypothetical release would not result in offsite chlorine concentrations exceeding the EPA's designated endpoint concentration of 8.7 x 10-6 kg/m3.\n\nThe Luke Mill has been in full compliance with the Process Safety Management requirements under 29 CFR Part 1910.119 for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of chlorine dioxide, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide since the early nineties.  In fact, the Luke Mill has always been a leader in operational safety.  Over the"

      "SummaryText": "past ten years we have implemented a multitude of programs designed to decrease the likelihood of these hypothetical release scenarios.  These programs include extensive operator training, mechanical integrity procedures, written standard operating procedures, and management of change procedures.  We have also developed and implemented safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry permits, hot work permits, and control over workplace entrances.  These programs were not only written by management personnel, but everyone including operators, contractors, and engineers were involved.  The Luke Mill also has its own volunteer fire squad, rescue squad, and hazardous materials team.  These groups and their associated equipment may be used in the event of an accident involving chlorine dioxide and chlorine.  The mill's Tank Integrity Program insures tanks, storing hazardous materials, are checked for tank integrity on a regular schedule. \n\nWithin the past few years the Luke Mill has made operational changes which have had a direct impact on the Risk Management Plan.  Strict storage limitations have been placed on certain chemicals to guarantee amounts on-site remain small in quantity.  Secondary containment has been placed around the chlorine cylinders and chlorine dioxide tanks.  In addition the Luke Mill has eliminnated chlorine bleaching, an act which decreases the amount of chlorine stored on-site by approximately 360 tons.\n\nThere have been no accidents at the Luke Mill during the previous  5 years.\n\nThe Luke Mill maintains as part of its Process Safety Management requirements an emergency action plan in accordance with 29 CFR 191.38(a).  The emergency response program includes the following items: 1) procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidential releases, 2) documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidential human exposure, 3) procedures for emergency response after a"

The emergency response plan was reviewed and updated in August 2008.  Emergency training was also provided to the mill's employees in August 2008.  The mills response activities are coordinated with the LEPC of Allegany County.  The LEPC's phone number is (310) 777-7112.\n\nEmergency Response policies can be found in NewPage Corporation's, Luke Mill, Emergency Diaster Response Manual.  Section 1 of this Manual contains response procedures in the event of an accidential release of a hazardous material.  Standard Opeerating Procedures have been written for mill departments which use and store hazardous materials.  Jeffry B. Neubauer is the facility's representative to the LEPC.  Mr. Neubauer is actively involved with the commission.\n\nSafety for the community, as well as employees, has been given top priority by the Luke Mill.  By implementing safety procedures and installing and maintaining safety equipment, the Luke Mill has been able to establish a good safety record.  In the event of an accident, the mill has a fire squad, rescue squad, hazardous materials team, and an emergency response program to deal with the situiation.  NewPage Corporation's Luke Mill has been a proud and responsible neighbor for more than 100 years; we plan to continue that tradition.\n\nIn June of 2008 the Luke Mill's Risk Management Plan was audited.  In August of 2008 the Risk Management Plan was updated and resubmitted to the EPA identifying changes concerning the discontinued use of Sulfur Dioxide for controlling emission particulates and certain revisions in operational and contact information."
