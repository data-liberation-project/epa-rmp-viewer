If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Scott County Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to an emergency. \n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled. This facility is designed to extract natural gas liquids and water from the inlet gas streams and returns dried natural gas back to the pipelines. The Fruehauf plant processes natural gas containing hydrocarbon vapors, hydrocarbon liquids, and impurities such as H2S, CO2, nitrogen, and water.  For the Fruehauf plant, the mass of flammable chemicals (methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and propylene) held up in the plant process and storage exceed the 10,000 lb threshold limit for these chemicals. During the liquid extraction process the composition of the process streams varies; for reporting purposes the process streams are aggregated into one mixed hydrocarbon mass. There are two product storage tanks at Fruehauf. These tanks are pressurized bullet tanks of 30,000 gallons each. They store the NGL that has been processed from the inlet plant gas until such time that a tank truck is scheduled to be loaded for transport to customers for sales or further processing. \n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios. The worst case scenario is the detonation of the Product Storage Tanks resulting in the detonation of a vapor cloud containing all the material released from the vessel or pipe. The affected zone circle for this detonation encompasses all the other WCS affected zone circles. The alternative release scenario is the activation of the pressure safety valve on the NGL storage vessel caused by high pressure from overfilling the vessel or thermal expansion while the vessel is above normal high liquid levels.\n"
