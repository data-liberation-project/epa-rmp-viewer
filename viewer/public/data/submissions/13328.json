Facility Policy\n\n     The management and staff of Calumet Farm Service Center are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the company is prepared to work with the local volunteer fire department, the Canadian Co, LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize its effect to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility information\n\n     The primary activity at this facility is receiving, storing and shipping wheat.  Secondary operations are the loading of dry fertilizers and anhydrous ammonia.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed in 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for direct application to loils for agricultural purposes.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 35,000 pounds which is stored in one 8,000 gallon stationary tank with attached load out station.\n\n3.  Worst- case and alternative release scenarios\n\n     a. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 8,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 35,000 pounds which represents 85 percent of this tank as limited by the design standards and monitored by management of inventories by the location manager.  The distance to end point (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .61 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternative release scenario would be the release from a break in a transfer hose.  The time of release would likely be 2 minutes or less.  The quantity released would approximate 2900 pounds from a 1 inch load out hose and the distance to end point (point of dispersion to 200ppm) would be .22 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\n     This facility has implemented provisions of the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture standards for the s"

The five year accident history\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n     a.  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility: nor\n\n     b.  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations or sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program\n\n     The facility has:\n\n     a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38:\n\n     b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n     Safety inspection, improvement and training of personnell are an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed, using California's Hazard Assessment checklist, to assess the maintenance of safe working conditions.  There are no additional safety reccommendations to implement at this time."
