It is possible (but unlikely) that such a release could be on-going for a period of up to one hour before  intervening action can be taken by trained personnel.  The location of the facility in the community, together with the topography and consideration for prevailiing wind direction, help to minimize the overall risk to human populations.\nAn OSHA-prescribed Process Safety Management Program is in place at the Perishable Warehouse.  Under that Program, the major components of the process are inspected frequently.  Operating conditions are constantly monitored by a computerized system with integral alarms that notify process operators of an upset.  The readily-distinguished odor of ammonia alerts persons in the constantly-inhabited areas where ammonia-containing piping and equipment is located that even the slightest release may have occurred.  Shutoff valves which allow operators to isolate sections of piping/equipment from areas of safety, such as the somewhat isolated compressor room area, are installed and are readily accessible.  The compressor room area is well vented with high volume fans, and is readily accessible in case of a release in that area.\nAs a testimony to the overall safety of the ammonia refrigerations at this facility, and the diligence of the process operators, no accidents have occurred within the past five years which have necessitated an off-site evacuation or have had any offsite consequences.\nThe Robeson County LEPC is charged with the primary responibility for emergency response at this location.

Under this plan, emergency training and practice drills will be frequent and will cover a multitude of potential scenarios.  Three key managers will become involved immediately upon the recognition and characterization of all non-incidental ammonia releases, and their duties will be as follows:  (a) coordination of and direction to onsite and external emergency responders; (b) notification of agencies and on-site safety and security; (c) protection and continuation of business operations and employee welfare; and (d) communication with the public as necessary.\nNash Finch Company continues to investigate and implement changes to the ammonia process in order to improve safety and minimize risks associated with it.  The annual operating budget includes sufficient allocation of fiscal resources to continuously maintain and improve the process and promote the training of operators and supervisory personnel."

      "SummaryText": "The Nash Finch Company - Lumberton Distribution Center business is food products warehousing and distribution to client grocery stores and distribution centers.  The principal building includes a Perishable Warehouse with an ammonia refrigeration system which contains over 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  The closed ammonia refrigeration system contains a maximum intended inventory of 15,000 pounds.  The facility is located in a rural setting outside of Lumberton, North Carolina.\nThe facility has an active Process Safety Management Program.  Access to the ammonia equipment is restricted to only a select few trained, authorized operating/maintenance personnel.  Most of the service work is done by a service contractor.  The majority of the distribution piping and critical isolation valves which contain ammonia are located outside of the refrigerated spaces, above the roof, and therefore are not suseptable to damage from accidental, inadvertant contact by lift trucks and lifted loads.  However, air cooling units are located within the refrigerated spaces, but so as to minimize susceptibility to inadvertent contact all equipment and associated piping within those spaces is located as high as possible within the spaces.   \nIn a worst-case scenario, the entire contents of the ammonia refrigeration system would be expelled in 10 minutes:  the release rate would be 1500 pounds per minute, or less.  This might result from the rupture of a 2 high pressure (180 psig) liquid ammonia pipe, which is an unlikely but nevertheless plausible scenario.  In such a case, the distance to toxic endpoint (200 ppm) under worst-case ambient conditions (still air) is anticipated to be 2.2 miles.  Ammonia is an extremely hazardous and toxic chemical, but the toxicity level is substantial:  the offensive, choking odor of ammonia is readily distinguished and familiar to most humans, who generally are intolerant of even low (<20 ppm) dosages.  The toxicity concentration is 2400 ppm or above.  The more"
