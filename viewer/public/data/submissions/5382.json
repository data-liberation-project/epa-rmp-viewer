To comply with the requirements in 40 CFR 68\nChemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the CITY OF BOWIE (CITY)\ndeveloped a Risk Management Program (RMProgram) for the BWTP including\nManagement System, Hazard Assessment, Accidental Release Prevention\nProgram, and Emergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to\nreduce the employee and public risk of injury, death or damage from\naccidental release of chemicals.\n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe City has the overall responsibility for implementing and\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\nwith the Management System, the City Manager is designated as the\nRMProgram Director, and the Water Plant Superintendent is the\nRMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are assigned\nresponsibility for implementing each individual requirement set forth\nin the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or Emergency Response\nPlan.  The RMProgram participants include the following positions:\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\nB.   RMProgram Manager\nC.   Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequence Analysis Update Officer\nD.   Safety Information Officer\nE.   Hazard Review Update Officer\nF.   Operations Manager\nG.   Training Supervisor\nH.   Maintenance Supervisor\nI.   Compliance Audit Officer\nJ.   Incident Investigation Officer\nK.   Emergency Planning and Response Officer\nL.   RMPlan Update Officer\n\nManagement system detailed descriptions and procedures are provide in\nthe Accidental Release Prevention Program to ensure every participant\nplaying a role in the RMProgram understands their responsibilities.\n\n2    REGULATED CHEMICALS AND PROCESSES\n\nRegulated toxic chemicals and processes at the BWTP consist of\nstorage, transfer, and use of chlorine in the chlorination system.\n\nChlorine gas is stored as pressurized liquid in five (5) side-by-side\ncylinders located indoors.

The maximum process quantity is 10,000 lbs.,\nignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\n3    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Hazard Assessment has been completed for the BWTP.  Offsite\nconsequence analysis modeling was performed based on the following\nprinciple elements:\n\nA.   Meteorological parameters for the dispersion modeling analysis\n     were determined using National Weather Service data collected at\n     the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.  Highest daily\n     maximum temperature and average relative humidity over the last\n     three-year period were used for worst-case scenarios.  Typical\n     meteorological conditions based on the data over the last \n     three-year period were used for alternative release scenarios.\n\nB.   Total quantity in the single largest tank was used for the\n     chlorine worst-case scenario.  Damage to a cylinder angle valve\n     was assumed for the chlorine alternative release scenario.\n\nC.   No mitigation measure was considered in the worst-case scenario. \n     For the alternative scenario, a release rate adjustment of 0.55\n     was considered for passive mitigation since the accident was\n     assumed to occur inside a building.\n\nD.   Distances to toxic endpoints for the chlorine worst-case scenario\n     was modeled using both RMPG-WWTP Table and ALOHA, a dense gas\n     dispersion model.\n\nE.   Distance to the toxic endpoint for the chlorine alternative\n     scenario was modeled using a dense gas dispersion model, ALOHA.\n\nF.   Offsite impact was evaluated with LANDVIEW III for each release\n     scenario.\n\nThe accidental release of chlorine from a one-ton cylinder is\nconsidered the worst-case scenario. A distance of 3.0 miles between\nthe release source and the toxic endpoint was modeled in the offsite\nconsequence analysis.  The alternative scenario impact distance is 1.2\nmiles for chlorine.\n\nFor the worst-case scenario, LANDVIEW III estimated a population of\n950 persons within the wors"

Public receptors within the alternate release\nscenario impact area are residences, recreation areas, and commercial,\noffice, or industrial areas.  No environmental receptors are within\nthe impact area of the worst-case scenario.\n\n4    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nA comprehensive Accidental Release Prevention Program Manual was\ndeveloped. The main purpose of the manual is to provide operation and\nmaintenance personnel detailed standard procedures to reduce employee\nand public risk to injury, death, or property damage from accidental\nchemical releases.

Development of a safety information database essential for the\n     successful implementation of other procedures, including\n     operation, maintenance, training, compliance audits, incident\n     investigation, and emergency planning and response.\n\nB.   Implementation of corrective actions recommended during the most\n     recent hazard review completed on June 18, 1999.
