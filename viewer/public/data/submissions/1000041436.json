The Facility Policy: The management, and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with that material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information: A primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia to be used for sale to farmers.. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. \r\n\r\n3. Worst- Case Scenario/Alternate-Case Scenario:  This facility has developed a worst-case and alternate-case scenario however it has been withheld from the Executive Summary as  security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\r\n\r\n4. Accidental Release Program: This facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia  including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 191 0.111 and regulations administered by our state agency. Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for employees. \r\n\r\n5. The Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years. \r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120. Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to the state emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA. \r\n\r\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance"
