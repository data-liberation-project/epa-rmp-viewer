Vaporizers would be installed to maintain the desired pressure and temperature of the ammonia as delivered to the SCR ammonia injection grid.\n\nC. Description of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBoth (existing and newly predicted) processes at SJRPP exceed the chemical threshold quantities for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and are therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places both (existing and newly predicted) SJRPP processes in the Program 3 level.  The SJRPP facility will use its existing PSM program for the Makeup Water Chlorination process as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  SJRPP is in the process of developing a new PSM program for the newly predicted SCR Ammonia Process reported in this RMP submittal.\n\nThe SJRPP has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  To ensure that all requirements of the RMP regualtion were met, the original PSM Program was reviewed and updated in 2007 in conjunction with the SCR process installation.  The PSM Program includes written operating procedures for the chlorination and ammonia processes.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the chlorination and ammonia processes to ensure consistency of operation and to minimize human error.  The PSM Program also includes a preventative maintenance plan, which requires all chlorination and ammonia equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Safe work practices, such as Lockout/tagout and Hot Work Permit, have long been required by the SJRPP Safety/Security Department.  These were reviewed and updated to ensure that"

      "SummaryText": "all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the collection and review of all equipment information and the development of updated Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  These actions will help to ensure that the equipment meets all chlorination and ammonia industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  The staff performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the chlorination process and will perform a PHA of the SCR Ammonia process in November of 2007.\n\nD. Five Year Accident History\n\nThe SJRPP has had no accidental releases of chlorine or ammonia in the last five years.\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThe SJRPP has an Emergency Evacuation Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal incidental emergency response capability and has a procedure for addressing small releases of chlorine, entitled SJRPP Procedure for Chlorine Emergency Response (SJRPP Procedure SF-039).  A similar procedure for ammonia releases is being prepared and will be implemented prior to ammonia delivery into the new SCR process.  The current plan has been coordinated with Moran Environmental Recovery, a private company whose service is the repair and clean-up of chemical spills.  If needed, additional assistance can be obtained from the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911.\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSJRPP will implement recommendations resulting from the most recent PHA and RMP compliance audit in order to improve safety."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nST. JOHNS RIVER POWER PARK\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nRE-SUBMITTAL: JUNE 2007\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe St. Johns River Power Park (SJRPP) is co-owned by JEA and Florida Power and Light Company.  The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plant Manager retains ultimate responsibility for these procedures, while specific duties are delegated to other employees.\n\nB. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe SJRPP is a two-unit power generation plant located at 11201 New Berlin Road, northeast of downtown Jacksonville, Florida, two miles north of the State Road 9-A and Hecksher Drive intersection.  SJRPP adds chlorine as a biocide to the makeup water and will install an anhydrous ammonia supply process for the selective catalytic reduction system (SCR) in October 2007.\n\nSJRPP stores liquefied chlorine in up to eighteen one-ton containers at the Makeup Water Chlorination process.  Six containers are always connected to the process, while up to twelve additional containers are stored adjacent to the connected containers.  The maximum total inventory in the process is 36,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The Chlorination system for Makeup Water is enclosed in a building that meets passive mitigation requirements and has active mitigation in the form of a chemical scrubber that is activated by the chlorine detectors to mitigate any chlorine release.\n\nThe anticipated SCR anhydrous ammonia supply process would include four storage tanks with a capacity of 58,500 gallons (252,614 lbs.) each.  The sum of these tanks (1,010,456 lbs.) exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The tanks would store the ammonia as a gas liquefied under pressure and would be filled to a maximum level of 85% full.  Operating"
