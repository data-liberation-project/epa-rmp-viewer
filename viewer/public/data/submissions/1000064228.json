Trained personnel visit the site routinely to review process operations and storage tank levels and conduct any needed maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe onsite employee is not trained on or associated with plant operations.\n\n\n\nAccidental releases are further reduced through technologies integrated into the processes to prevent overpressurization and overfilling, including integrated and automatic shutoffs, pressure relief valves, and breakaways. The written program incorporates routine leak detection on pumps, valves, and pressure relief devices, equipment reviews, process monitoring, and preventative maintenance.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "This RMP is applicable to the Black Run Natural Gas Processing Plant and the co-located Black Run Propane Distribution Facility.\n\n\n\nI. Facility and Process Description\n\nAt this location, a natural gas processing plant chills natural gas from area natural gas wells, delivered via pipeline. The unprocessed natural gas is dehydrated, then chilled in the plant. In the plant, lighter materials, (e.g. methane, ethane), are extracted and re-introduced into the natural gas transmission pipeline. Propane is separated using fractionation from the remaining heavier materials, (e.g. pentane). The extracted NGLs are stored in their liquid form in a pressurized NGL Storage Tank, while the extracted propane is stored in a propane storage tank. NGLs are offloaded to a NGL tanker truck for transport to an offsite location for further processing. As needed, propane is transferred to one of the three propane storage tanks that makeup the Black Run Propane Distribution Facility.\n\n\n\nThe NGLs contain several regulated substances, (e.g. propane, n-butane, pentane, etc.), and the entire NGL mixture meets National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating 4 criteria for flammability. The amount of NGLs stored onsite is exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. A risk management plan was drafted and executed to reduce the risks of accidental release.\n\n\n\nAlthough fuels held for sale at a retail facility (including the Black Run Propane Distribution Facility) are exempt from the requirements of 40 CFR, Part 68, the Black Run Propane Distribution is co-located (within the same fenceline as) with the Black Run Natural Gas Processing Plant. As such, the Black Run Propane Distribution Facility is included within this Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nII. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, the facility trains personnel on the operation of the plant, storage tanks, NGLs and propane, and equipment through national training programs, manufacturer's training, and inter"

      "SummaryText": "nal training. One full-time employee is stationed onsite at the Black Run Propane Distribution Facility, but this employee is not trained on or associated with plant operations.\n\n\n\nTrained employees are onsite to supervise tanker truck loading, consistent with their training and written operating procedures. Trained personnel conduct routine leak inspections, assess processing parameters, review storage tank levels, and conduct any necessary maintenance. Visibly marked emergency shutoff switches with notices are available at the loading area and site exit.\n\n\n\nAccidental releases are further reduced through technologies integrated into the storage tanks and processing plant. These technologies include: check valves, emergency shutoffs, excess flow valves, over-pressure relief valves, and \"Smart Hose\" Flow Shutoff Valves on the loading arms.\n\n\n\nIII. Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at this site in the past five years.\n\n\n\nIV. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Control Center or any personnel that may be on-site will contact the local fire department to respond to the emergency. The local fire department also may respond based on their own notification via 911 or other emergency communication. The Energy Cooperative will provide technical assistance the local fire department during emergency response as required.\n\n\n\nV. Planned Safety Improvements\n\nThere are no planned safety improvements scheduled or required.\n\n\n\nVI. Revisions/Renewals\n\nThe original RMP was submitted to EPA on June 20, 2012. This RMP is a renewal of that RMP and include revisions. The NGL and Propane Storage Tanks maximum capacities were updated due to a change in the maximum storage capacities cited in NFPA 58 (2017) and 59 (2015); there were no process or inventory changes made at the facility."
