      "SummaryText": "The facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and condensate/oil from various field wells. Low-pressure gas from the incoming wells is directed to an inlet separator. The separated gas then goes to a first-stage compressor and exits to the facility's fluid extraction system.  NGL is a mixture of propane, butane, pentane and other heavier hydrocarbons. The NGL is stored in an pressurized tank until it is transported for sales by a pressurized tank truck service. \n\n\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would involve the release of the greatest amount from a single vessel as required by 40 CFR part 68.25 (b)- Determination of worst-case release quantity. This type of release may occur as a result of catastrophic nature or other unforeseen disaster, such as total tank failure or the failure of all installed safety devices. A release of 77,000 lbs. of NGL for a duration of 10 minutes in the form of a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) due to a 1 psi over-pressurization results in a 0.34 mile distance to the endpoint. There are no public or environmental receptors within a 0.34-mile radius of the facility. \n\n\n\nAn alternative scenario is not required for this facility because it is classified as a program 1 site.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release that caused on or off site injury, death or property damage within the past five years.\n\n\n\nA prevention program is not required for this facility. TYGR Operating, LLC is aware of the General Duty Clause and therefore provides the proper training to its employees to maintain a safe working environment and to minimize the possibility of an accidental release. The 18,000-gallon storage tank is equipped with relief valves venting to the atmosphere that automatically operate\n\naccording to preset pressure specifications. Manual shut-off valves are located at the NGL extraction v"
