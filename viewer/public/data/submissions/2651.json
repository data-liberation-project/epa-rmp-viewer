Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at SERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Vandalia Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u0012s primary activities encompass RETAIL FERTILIZER and AG CHEMICAL SALES.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances is Anhydrous Ammonia.  The regulated substances at our facility is used for Agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 51,000 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenariosand alternative cases we have used  The Fertilizer Institutes'  DEGADIS model for Worst-Case Ammonia Release.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Anhydrous Ammonia Bulk Plant.  The scenario involves the release of 51,000lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1."

The scenario involves the release of 11908lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 2 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include excess flow valve(s) and neutralization.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200ppm of Ammonia is 1.2 miles.\n\n\n4.
