The Fractionation Plant is located at 15608 Highway 61 adjacent to Motiva Enterprises LLC, an oil refinery, and Shell Chemical Company, a SOCMI chemical complex.  A location map is provided as Figure 1 in Appendix A.  The Fractionation Plant separates and recovers various components in natural gas liquids from nearby gas processing plants.  This plant produces ethane, propane, isobutane, n-butane, and natural gasoline.  The facility primarily consists of a deethanizer  (DeC2), a depropanizer (DeC3), a debutanizer (DeC4), two deisobutanizers (DIB), ethane treater, and on site storage facilities.  Process heat is provided by a closed loop hot oil system using direct fired natural gas furnaces.\n\nThe Norco Fractionation Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic material exceeds the threshold quantity set by 40 CFR 68.130.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Norco Fractionation Plant are natural gasoline, butane, isobutane, raw make, propane, rerun propane, and heating oil.  Since natural gasoline and heating oil have NFPA ratings less than 4, these two flammable substances are exempt from the threshold determination.  Because the distance of the worst-case release of a flammable substance reaches public receptors, and the Plant is subject to OSHA PSM, the Norco Fractionation Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Program (ARP).  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nThe Norco Fractionation Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.

      "SummaryText": "Enterprise policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\nThe endpoint for the worst-case release of a flammable substance is 1 psi overpressure (15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  Isobutane, stored in the new pressurized storage sphere, is the worst-case flammable release with a 1.40-mile distance to the endpoint.  \n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  One possible, more likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for the propane storage bullet (88 oF).  An overfilling of the bullet causes a release from the six-inch piping of the pressure relief valve set at 250 psi.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes and then ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the endpoint with a 1 psi over pressure for this release scenario is 0.25 miles, and the distance to the Lower Flammability Limit  (LFL) of propane in this scenario is 0.1 miles. \n\nToxic Substances\nThe Norco Fractionation Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.   \n\nGeneral Accident Release Program\nThe processes at the Norco Fractionat"

Within this program, each process has been systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nTwo main methods used to perform the PHA are hazard and operability and the what-if/checklist method analysis.  These analyses are conducted using people with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The goal is to identify and evaluate hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and then make final suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures where they are determined to be necessary.\n\nPHA findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to the findings are based on a relative risk ranking assigned in the PHA analysis.  These rankings help to ensure that the potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until completion, when final resolutions are documented and retained.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety"
