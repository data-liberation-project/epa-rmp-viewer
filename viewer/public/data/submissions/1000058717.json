Specifically, ongoing attention to the following elements of the PSM program adds significant value to prevent accidental release of hydrogen: Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Management, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Management of Change, Compliance Audits and Emergency Planning & Response.  The focus of our plan is to avoid incidents however; a thorough investigation will take place in the event of any incidents that impact the safe operation of the hydrogen plant.\r\n\r\nInstantaneous monitoring of the process and gas analysis by the plant operator goes on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Where appropriate these values are linked to process alarms and/or plant shutdowns.  Additionally, there are three types of hydrogen/flame detectors ((Point LEL detectors (catalytic bead), Ultrasonic acoustic detectors, and UV flame detectors)) that will alarm when conditions warrant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nNo accidents - The Calvert City facility began operation in September 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\n\r\nWestlake Chemical is the customer Airgas services across the fence from our site serves as our First Responders for the site and emergency coordination.  Airgas will call the Westlake Guard House at 270-395-3222.  In-turn, based on the nature of the emergency, Westlake will contact the local fire, EMS and law enforcement.  Westlake has resources on-site to respond to fire and medical emergencies.  Airgas and Westlake Chemical participate in a mutual aid program that is coordinated with emergency response agencies and the LEPC.\r\n\r\nIf the need is significant they will mobilize CIMAP (Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program).

Westlake has a Fire / Emergency Alarm code that is used to identify incidents on their site that may impact the Airgas facility.

This is why Airgas has established January as Safety Pledge Month at Airgas. We start the new year - each and every year - to be a time to recommit ourselves to safety by reading, embracing, and signing the Airgas Safety Pledge. The pledge is as follows:\r\n\r\nI WILL:\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATE my commitment to regard safety as the most important aspect of my job by not allowing unsafe conditions or practices to exist.  WORK toward the attainable goal of zero accidents and zero injuries and hold myself and others accountable in reaching this goal.  STOP a job or refuse to perform a job if it is not safe or cannot be performed safely.  TAKE personal responsibility for creating and maintaining a safe environment.  PERFORM my job with the understanding that working safely is a condition of my employment with Airgas.\r\n\r\nSAFECOR is the branch of Airgas that leads the way for all safety efforts.  SAFECOR stands for Safety, Environmental, Compliance and Risk Management, and its function is to liaise with and keep up to date with regulatory agencies including FDA, DOT, EPA, OSHA, DHS and DEA. SAFECOR interprets the application of legislation to our business and produces procedures, programs, policies, manuals and training programs to comply with that legislation.\r\n\r\nThe PSM program is an integral part in accidental release prevention. Additionally, the site is equipped with three types of hydrogen/flame detectors (Point LEL detectors (catalytic bead), Ultrasonic acoustic detectors, and UV flame detectors) that will alarm when conditions warrant.\r\n\r\nIt is the facility's policy to comply with all federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.
