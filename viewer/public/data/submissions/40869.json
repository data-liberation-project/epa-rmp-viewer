      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Bayer CropScience (BCS)\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBayer CropScience is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  We regularly assess the risks associated with the use of chemicals in our manufacturing processes using tools such as Hazard and Operability studies, and we seek out ways in which to reduce those risks.  It is our policy to proactively implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases. If such a release does occur, our highly-trained on-site emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  BCS has maintained a long-standing working relationship with the Kansas City emergency response team HAZMAT 71 to ensure their support in the event of an unexpected release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activities at our facility are the formulation and manufacture of crop protection chemicals.  There are eight regulated chemicals present at our facility. These chemicals are essential raw materials for the production of crop protection products, and are: 1) carbon disulfide, 2) chlorine, 3) ethyl mercaptan, 4) formaldehyde (solution), 5) methyl butene, 6) phosphorus trichloride,  7) vinyl chloride and 8) anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  \n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBCS has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This manufacturing facility was designed and constructed generally in accordance with NFPA-58, which was in effect at the time of construction.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the O"

      "SummaryText": "SHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The facility is also subject to the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC) under 40 CFR 112, the RCRA Preparedness and Prevention regulations and Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures under Subpart C and D of 40 CFR 264, and EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  \n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nBCS has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  There have been no accidental releases with offsite consequences during this period.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nBCS maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nBCS has an on-site emergency brigade, which is made up of approximately 60 employees and provides coverage 24 hours per day and 365 days per year.  The brigade is trained in fire and rescue.  BCS also has a trained HAZMAT team with approximately 10 employees available for emergencies when necessary.  The HAZMAT team, the brigade, and their equipment provide initial response for any emergencies that may occur.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is reviewed annually and updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA security and vulnerability assessment of the facility has been conducted in accordance with the American Chemical Council protocol.  Additional security upgrades are underway to improve safety at our facility.  It is anticipated that the upgrades will be  implemented by December 31, 2004."
