This group monitors the on-site implementation of the Process Safety Management programs through periodic meetings at each regulated facility.  In addition, the corporate safety group in conjunction with the local Depot Manager are responsible for maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  This policy is administered through Costco Wholesale's safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout / tagout, Hazardous Materials Inventory Reporting (Tier II), employee safety policies, manufacturers' documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n - To save lives.\n\n - To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n - To protect the environment.\n\n - To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  Based on corporate policies, Costco Wholesale personnel do not \"respond\" in an offensive way to ammonia emergencies, and the facility has therefore coordinated emergency response activities with the Tolleson Fire Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Costco Wholesale was completed in July 2000.

      "SummaryText": "l outlets.  The facility is located at 8400 Sherman Street in Tolleson, Arizona, about 1.5 miles south of the Interstate 10 freeway.  The immediate area is a mixture of agricultural, residential, light industrial and light commercial.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 18,000 pounds of ammonia for cross dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the high pressure receiver to the high temperature recirculator.  The high pressure receiver also supplies liquid ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  As the ammonia enters the high temperature recirculator, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the pressure (and hence the temperature) in order to maintain a predetermined internal pressure.  The high temperature recirculator feeds a similar vessel that maintains an intermediate pressure, the medium temperature recirculator.  Each recirculator vessel supplies pumped liquid ammonia to a distinct set of evaporators.  Fans in each evaporator are used to blow air across and through the coils which partially vaporizes the liquid ammonia as heat from the room is transferred to the ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe resulting two-phased (liquid/vapor) ammonia from each set of evaporators is returned to each recirculator respectively in which constant pressures (temperatures) are maintained based on the suction pressure of the corresponding compressors.  The vapor from the recirculators is then drawn to seven (7) compressors where the pressure and te"

      "SummaryText": "mperature of the gas is increased.  All seven compressors work in combination to compress the vapor pulled from the two recirculator vessels.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is routed to three (3) condensers where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and drained back to the high pressure receiver.  Hot gas is also used  for defrost of the freezer and meat evaporators.  An auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the condensers.  Dual pressure relief valve assemblies are installed on each vessel to relieve high pressure ammonia to a water diffusion tank through a common header in case of a high pressure event.  Ammonia vapor leak detectors are also located in the ammonia engine room as well as throughout the facility to alert Costco personnel in case of an accidental ammonia leak.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Costco Wholesale facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system.\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia leak detectors in the machine room and throughout the cold storage warehouse, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that"

A PHA Revalidation Study was completed in June 2020 that generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  Costco Wholesale is proceeding with implementation of these mitigation measures associated with these studies.  \n\n\n\nThe corporate safety group has also implemented an annual program to review the PSM and RMP programs at each of the facilities to ensure on-going compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs."

The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has not had any EPA RMP defined ammonia accidents during the past 5 years (July 2015 - July 2020).  \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the local Tolleson Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the county Hazardous Materials Response Team.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called immediately.\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The Depot Manager (or highest ranking manager on site) will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he/she is not available.
