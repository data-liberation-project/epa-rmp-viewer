This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant located in Polk County, Texas is owned by Teco Gas Processing Company and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant is a gas liquid extraction plant consisting of a two train cryogenic turboexpander process.  The plant is designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and is assembled primarily from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components.     Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  The plant processes the gas utilizing the installed turbo expander units to remove recoverable natural gas liquids from the inlet gas stream.  Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\r\n\r\nListed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at"

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Indian Springs Gas Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 3), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required only by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\r\n\r\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.

Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3)"

The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Indian Springs Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.
