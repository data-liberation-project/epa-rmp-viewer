      "SummaryText": "1. CALAMCO owners, management and employees are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous or aqua ammonia.  Should a release occur we are prepared to work closely with local authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to personnel or the environment.\n2. The primary activities are blending, storing and shipping ammonia solutions.  Primary storage consists of three 125,000 gallon tanks and seven smaller tanks (12,000 - 16,000 gallons); these activities are very seasonal with over 80% of blending, storing and moving occurring in April-May of each year, and 0-2% during the remaining months.\n3. Worst case scenarion for anhydrous ammonia is a catastorphic failure of the largest  storage tank; in this case 195,700 pounds of ammonia would be released.  Toxic endpoint is 8 miles.  Alternative release would be from a transfer hose failure.  Worst case scenarion for aqua ammonia would be a catastrophic failure of a primary storage tank; in this case 950,000 pounds would be released; toxic endpoint is 5.6 miles.\n4. The facility has implemented the provisions of K-61.1 published by the American National Standards Institute, California Code of Regulations \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\", and 29CFR, 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n5. There have been no accidents during the past five years.\n6. The Emergency Response Program was developed using 29CFR, 1910.38 and 1910.120 as well as the California Health and Safety Code.\n7. Safety improvement is an ongoing process; periodic evaluations are performed to assess the system.  There are no planned changes to the facility at this time."
