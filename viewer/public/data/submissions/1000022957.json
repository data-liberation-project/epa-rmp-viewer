This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  Additionally, the Blacks Fork Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all faucets of process safety management and accident prevention as well as ensures that all contractors are aware of the plants safety procedures and accident prevention policy.  \n\nQEP 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  QEP 's Blacks Fork Gas Plant has coordinated with the Lyman Fire Department for emergency response procedures.  \n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Blacks Fork Gas Plant is located approximately 5 miles southwest of the town of Granger, Wyoming, on the border between Uinta and Sweetwater Counties.  \n\nThe Blacks Fork facility utilizes field gas that enters the facility and is then separated and routed into two (2) natural gas liquid (NGL's) extraction units (Train 1 and Train 2).  The two trains are then treated, dehydrated and sent through the demethanizer.  Once complete, the NGL's is sent to a NGL's pipeline, storage or the fractionation unit (consisting of a deethanizer, depropanizer and debutanizer.  The residual propane and butane is condensed and sent to individual storage, on site.  All of these substances are regulated under the RMP program and considered a flammable mixture.  QEP  has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.7 miles, for each worst case release scenario, and quali"

      "SummaryText": "fies for Program 1 due to the plant's distance from any public receptors.   The Blacks Fork Gas Plant does not use and/or process any regulated toxic substances about threshold quantities.  \n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nBlacks Fork Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five (5) years.  There have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs.  Additionally, there have been no OSHA reportable incidents in the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Blacks Fork Gas Plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency response including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for all personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post incident clean up requirements.\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  \n\nQEP  employees and contractors receive training in these procedures as necessary and have completed a safety plot plan with two (2) designated escape rendezvous areas in case of an onsite emergency.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan is updated as needed and all employees are trained accordingly with each update to the ER Plan."
