To comply with the requirements in 40 CFR 68\n\nChemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the CITY OF BOWIE (City)\n\ndeveloped a Risk Management Program (RMProgram) for the BWTP including\n\nManagement System, Hazard Assessment, Accidental Release Prevention\n\nProgram, and Emergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to\n\nreduce the employee and public risk of injury, death, or damage from\n\naccidental release of chemicals.\n\n\n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThe City has the overall responsibility for implementing and\n\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\n\nwith the Management System, the City Manager is designated as the\n\nRMProgram Director, and the Water Plant Superintendent is the\n\nRMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are assigned\n\nresponsibility for implementing each individual requirement set forth\n\nin the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or Emergency Response\n\nPlan.  The RMProgram participants include the following positions:\n\n\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\n\nB.   RMProgram Manager\n\nC.   Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequence Analysis Update Officer\n\nD.

The maximum process quantity is 10,000 lbs.,\n\nignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\n\n\n3    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\nThe Hazard Assessment has been completed for the BWTP.  Offsite\n\nconsequence analysis modeling was performed based on the following\n\nprinciple elements:\n\n\n\nA.   Meteorological parameters for the dispersion modeling analysis\n\n     were determined using National Weather Service data collected at\n\n     the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.  Highest daily\n\n     maximum temperature and average relative humidity over the last\n\n     three-year period were used for worst-case scenarios.  Typical\n\n     meteorological conditions based on the data over the last \n\n     three-year period were used for alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\nB.   Total quantity in the single largest tank was used for the\n\n     chlorine worst-case scenario.  Damage to a cylinder angle valve\n\n     was assumed for the chlorine alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nC.   No mitigation measure was considered in the worst-case scenario. \n\n     For the alternative scenario, a release rate adjustment of 0.55\n\n     was considered for passive mitigation since the accident was\n\n     assumed to occur inside a building.\n\n\n\nD.   Distances to toxic endpoints for the chlorine worst-case scenario\n\n     was modeled using both RMPG-WWTP Table and ALOHA, a dense gas\n\n     dispersion model.\n\n\n\nE.   Distance to the toxic endpoint for the chlorine alternative\n\n     scenario was modeled using a dense gas dispersion model, ALOHA.\n\n\n\nF.   Offsite impact was evaluated with LANDVIEW III for each release\n\n     scenario.\n\n\n\nSince there has been no process change, as described in the previous report, new modeling efforts are not required.  The meteorological conditions, source parameters, and dispersion modeling analysis will be similar as submitted in the report mentioned above.\n\n\n\nRe-evaluation of offsite impacts on population, public, and environme"

Hence, the recent census and mapping data contained in the latest LANDVIEW 6 software was used to re-evaluate the offsite impacts for each scenario developed in the previous report.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release of chlorine from a one-ton cylinder is considered the worst-case scenario.  A distance of 3.0 miles between the release source and the toxic endpoint was modeled in the offsite consequence analysis.  The alternative scenario impact distance is 1.2 miles for chlorine.\n\n\n\nFor the worst-case scenario, LANDVIEW 6 estimated a population of 5,946 persons within the worst-case scenario impact radius of 3.0 miles.  The LANDVIEW 6 estimated population for the alternative release impact area as 710 persons.\n\n\n\nPublic receptors within the worst-case scenario impact area include schools, residences, recreation areas, and commercial, office, or industrial areas.

Plant employees are limited to responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance procedures.  Appropriate procedures were initially developed will be updated.  Procedures provide instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak is considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local emergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Procedures were developed to meet regulatory requirements, such as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation, availability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at the BWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is the Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Bowie Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding regulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management Office who has developed and implemented emergency response plans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in emergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated processes.
