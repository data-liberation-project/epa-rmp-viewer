If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Franklin County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n2.    Facility Information. The primary activity at the facility is filling of aerosol cans with propane. This small amount of propane acts as the propellant to expel the products from the aerosol cans. After the propane has been added to the cans, the cans are packaged 12 per fiberboard box for shipment.\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program. This facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.110, A?Storage and handling of Liquefied Petroleum GasesA? and Missouri State regulations covering propane.\n4.    Five-Year Accident History. There have been no accidental releases of propane in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n5.    Emergency Response Program. We do not plan to have our employees respond to a release of propane. We have an Emergency Action Plan and in case of a release we will notify the LEPC, SERC, NRC, and other appropriate authorities. \n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety. Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. We currently are in the process of establishing EPAA?s Prevention Program Number 3 at the facility. We have developed a Standard Operating Procedure for the development of our Prevention Program Number 3. This standard operating procedure is intended to provide company employees with basic guidance to assist them in the development of company plans and SOPs which address the iss"
