Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nAt this facility, we manufacture specialty chemicals.  Nine (9) chemicals in the amounts handled by our facility exceed the RMP Threshold Quantity (TQ).  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  APMC manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the safe design of the plant.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER Standard.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacture of specialty chemicals.  These specialty chemicals are used by our customers in a variety of application.  Raw materials are received at our plant by rail car, bulk tank truck, drums and pipeline and used as feedstock.  The products are stored in tanks on site and shipped to customers via rail car, bulk tank truck, tote bins or drums. \r\n\r\n3.

This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\r\n\r\n4.  Five-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents involving releases of toxics or flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5.  The emergency response program:\r\n\r\nThe facility emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER Standard.  All employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  All employees are trained to the First Responder Awareness Level and receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Additionally, the site has designated emergency coordinators that will execute the site emergency plan while providing general plant operations information to community responders. Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Sedgwick County Fire Department and periodic drills are conducted with agencies as well as our internal corporate Crisis Management Team to evaluate the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.\r\n\r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nPresently, there are no administrative, operational, process, or equipment changes planned for this facility involving RMP covered chemicals.  The facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Near Miss investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures.\r\n\r\nThe facility also strives toward continuous improvement in regards to EH&S and good engineering practices and design.
