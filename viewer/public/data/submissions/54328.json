Polymer Division\n1000 0004 7585\n\nIntroduction\nThe Polymer Division of JohnsonDiversey produces emulsions and solid and liquid resins for BASF, which purchased the Polymer Division in 2006.  The JohnsonDiversey (JD) Polymer Plant is located in the southwest portion of the SC Johnson Waxdale manufacturing plant in Sturtevant, Wisconsin.\n\nRMP Regulated Chemicals and Processes\nThe JD Polymer Plant stores, transfers, and processes one chemical in quantities exceeding the applicable risk management plan (RMP) threshold on EPA?s list of regulated chemicals.  Aqueous Ammonia (30% concentration) is used in the emulsion manufacturing process.  The bulk storage tank and associated piping is the only area of the JD Polymer Plant with aqueous ammonia present exceeding the RMP threshold amount.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe JD Polymer Plant has many policies and procedures to ensure the safe operation of its facilities.  Some of these include the written operating procedures describing how to execute a task safely, training employees on the procedures that are needed to perform their jobs, training employees how to respond to emergencies, supporting the Waxdale Emergency Response Brigade, and empowering employees to shut down activities that they believe are unsafe.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n Some of the safety measures employed by the JD Polymer Plant include:\n?Documented information pertaining to the equipment, technology, and chemicals used in the process\n?A complete Process Hazard Analysis for all affected operations and equipment to identify possible release scenarios and recommendations to mitigate/eliminate such release scenarios.\n?Written operating procedures for start-up, normal operations, emergency operations, operating limits, and consequences of deviation.\n?Early detection systems that include high level alarms and interloc"

The tank is periodically inspected to monitor the condition of the tank.  The tank is filled under the supervision of a qualified operator, so that the response time to an incident is reduced.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThere were no accidents within the last five years that have resulted in any offsite impacts to people or the environment.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe JD Polymer Plant works closely with the local fire department and SC Johnson Emergency Response Brigade. Polymer Division employees receive training on the Emergency Response Plan for initial assignment, and or when their responsibilities with respect to the Plan are changed; and or whenever the Emergency Response Plan is revised.  Additionally, employees are also involved in facility drills to test the emergency capabilities and response.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThere are no planned changes with regard to the ammonium hydroxide tank at the JD Polymer Plant."
