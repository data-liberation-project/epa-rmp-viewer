      "SummaryText": "The JEA's Arlington East Water Reclamation Facility is a wastewater treatment plant serving the northeast Jacksonville area.  It is permitted to treat 20 million gallons of wastewater per day and is about to embark on a reuse program that would supply irrigation water to local golf courses and public parks.\n\nJEA's motto is building community and a vital part of that is ensuring the safety of its employees and neighbors.  As a result, operations and maintenance (O&M) and the Field Compliance and Incident Response (FCIR) sections view the upkeep and maintenance of its Risk Management Program as a vital component in sustaining the well being of those in the Arlington East WRF service area.\n\nThe Arlington East WRF utilizes a gaseous chlorine system to disinfect its effluent.  In order to discharge into the river, it must pass a rigorous test of various parameters detailed in its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit issued by the local Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) office.  One of those parameters is ensuring that the residual chlorine is decreased sufficiently before discharging into the St. John's River.  Treatment using sulfur dioxide ensures that this is accomplished.\n\nBoth the chlorine and sulfur dioxide are delivered to the facility in one ton cylinders.  The most advantageous part of the chlorination and de-chlorination system of the facility in terms of safety is the fact that these cylinders are enclosed within a fortified building.  Not only is this building well built and secured, it also is equipped with a scrubber system so that in the event that there is a release, gases would immediately be contained in the building and properly treated until a safe ambient level is achieved..\n\nBetween this safe layout, preventative maintenance by O&M, and the implementation of the RMP program by FCIR with the assistance of Golder and Associates; JEA is able to properly address these safety issues while still providing utility servi"
