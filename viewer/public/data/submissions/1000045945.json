This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nTAP has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; Facility Response Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\n\n\nTAP participated in a Full Scale Exercise with the Southwest Planning, Exercising, and Training Region on August 21, 2010, funded in part by the U.S. DHS, Hitchcock County, and TAP.  The purpose of the exercise was to bring together the hospitals, EMS, fire, law enforcement, public sector and emergency management agencies that would have responsibility in responding to a mass casualty event.  TAP has a final After Action Report detailing the exercise onsite for review by EPA during normal business hours.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nTAP ethanol plant is located in Trenton, Hitchcock County, Nebraska. The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from"

The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n1. Anhydrous Ammonia: Anhydrous Ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an aboveground steel tank. The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, creating a vapor cloud. Information from the Fertilizer Institute (DEGADIS) was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; 2.34 miles radius. It is assumed passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. Massacre Canyon Historical Monument, Republican River, and Upper Meeker Canal are within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia.\n\n\n\n2. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground steel tank. The located is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.5 mile radius. Of the entire tank contents, only a portion was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112(r). Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data.

      "SummaryText": "rth.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenarios:\n\n1. Anhydrous Ammonia:  The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed is 2 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility and the excess flow valve has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation.  Information from the Fertilizer Institute (DEGADIS) was used to determine the alternative distance to endpoint; 0.92 miles radius.  Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. The Massacre Canyon Historical Monument and Republican River are within the alternative distance to endpoint for ammonia.\n\n\n\n2. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.   The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.   For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine "

Public receptor information was obtained using facility's knowledge of surrounding area.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant.  \n\n\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Process Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\n\n\nTAP's maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations. Monthly visual inspections are performed and quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reported per NDEQ requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nOn March 16, 2010 a sample valve was accidentally left open on the 200 Proof Ethanol tank, as a result 200 Proof ethanol spilled into the tank farm containment structure.  In addition, the manual overflow valve was left open in the tank farm berm allowing the spilled ethanol to be released to the environment.  TAP reported the release in accordance with Nebraska guidelines and the contaminated water was sequestered to allow the ethanol to dissipate out of the water. Ethanol is not a reportable chemical for RMP purposes and therefore was not claimed on the Accident History portion of this RMP.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nTAP has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan and Facility Response Plan. TAP has evacuation and response procedures for fires, explosions, spills, etc. outlined in the facil"
