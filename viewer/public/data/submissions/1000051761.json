The facility lies approximately 500 yards west of State Highway 99 and 500 yards north of State Highway 120 near the intersection of the two highways.  The facility is situated in an area comprised primarily of light industrial facilities, commercial and office areas, some agricultural lands, and residential areas.\n\n\n\nThis facility stores ice cream and pizza products for distribution under approximately 98,000 square feet of total warehouse space, with approximately 70,000 square feet of refrigerated space.  The remaining areas include office areas, the control room, and the engine room.  There is no manufacturing at this facility.\n\n\n\nThe distribution center employs approximately 45 people and the refrigeration system operates 24 hours per day.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\n\n\nThis facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a heat transfer fluid in the plant refrigeration system.  The system is a single-stage, multi-suction, economized mechanical refrigeration system that utilizes recirculated liquid feed to evaporator coils.  Cooling is required for the 10?F Shipping Dock and for the -20?F freezer.  The system charge is approximately 13,500 lbs.\n\n\n\nOne high-temperature screw compressor provides suction and compression for the high temperature cooling, while two low-temperature screw compressors serve the low-temperature cooling requirements.  A swing screw compressor can back-up either the high-temperature or low-temperature requirements as needed.\n\n\n\nThe heat of compression in the high-pressure compressor discharge is removed in the evaporative condenser.  The condenser drains high-pressure liquid to the thermosyphon / high-pressure receiver for screw compressor cooling and Recirculator package liquid ammonia as required.  Liquid from the high-temperature Recirculator (HTR) and the low-temperature Recirculator (LTR) is pumped to "
