Activities conducted in the preparation of this report included, but were not limited to, review of original registration information, verification of longitude and latitude using U.S. Geological Survey information, Worst Case & Alternative Case release scenarios using EPA RMPComp software, population estimation using Landview data, review of the most recent 5-year accident history records, and complete review of all original RMP/PHA documentation from June 1999.  A modified version of the procedures used to develop the original RMP were followed to prepare this update.\n\nAll procedures, plans, and recommendations from the original 1999 RMP were reviewed and verified.  With minor updates, it was determined that the Fowler Packing operating procedures, accident prevention plan, and evergency response plan are current, still effective, and complete.  Where necessary the original RMP information has been corrected or appended to update the risk management program with changes to information, lists, and contacts during the subsequent period since initial implementation.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases from this facility during the past 5-year period covered by te current RMP.\n\nProcess Information\n\nThe site is located 8 miles South of Fresno, California between Hwy 41 and Hwy 99.  The topography is generally flat and is rural, dedicated to farming with orchards and vineyards surrounding the facility for several miles in most directions.  Ambient temperatures are seldom below freezing in the winter and summer highs are over 100 degrees F several days each year.  Winds are still during the winter and slight breezes are typical morning and afternoon the remainder of the year.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Fowler Packing is of a flooded design in which liquid ammonia is used in a metal pipe evaporator coil"

      "SummaryText": " to cool air to remove field heat from fresh fruit for seasonal storage.  Most ammonia containing components are with-in the building structures of the facility and are isolated from the public and all unauthorized personnel.\n\nFacilities requiring refrigeration include six storage rooms, six pre-cooling rooms, and one process room.  Five screw compressors connected in parallel are located in a mechanical room on the east side of the building.  Three evaporative condensers are mounted on structural steel supports outside the southeast corner of the building.  One high pressure receiver is located inside the mechanical room.\n\nSuction vapor and liquid piping is primarily located on roof areas accessible only to authorized personnel.  Room evaporator coils are located in enclosed bunkers behind one wall in each room.  Process room evaporator coils are with-in the refrigerated space and suspended from the roof structure.\n\nAll of the system pressure vessels and equipment are protected by pressure safety relief valves that are vented to a code required ammonia diffusion tank.  Refrigeration controls are programmable logic control based with electric valve actuators.  All critical components have redundancy, fail safe positions for power outages, and can be operated manually if required.  In the event of power failure the system design automatically maintains safe system pressures and the system restarts automatically upon return of power."
