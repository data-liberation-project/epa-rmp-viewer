      "SummaryText": " Tampa Bay Fisheries, Inc. continues to upgrade it's operator engineer training, ammonia refrigeration equipment, and  the safety leadership to ensure safe and efficient operation of it's facility in compliance with E.P.A.and OSHA REGULATIONS. Our goal continues to be zero accidents, zero spills and releases.                                   \n\n\n\nOur RMP and Process Safety Management program is constantly being reviewed as our facility is undergoing many improvements and personel changes in our ammonia refrigeration department . Along with the physical changes to our facility,our personel are being trained on the new as well as existing processes.The installation of more sophisticated control points to the ammonia refrigeration system will help us reach and keep our goal at zero.\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis is also one of the corner stones to a safe operating facility. As our processes change each will trigger a change in the PHA which will carry through to the PSM program and the RMP. We are pleased to use the tools as oulined above to keep Tampa Bay Fisheries, Inc mitigating the risks associated with ammonia.\n\n \n\n We have also improved the freezer dedicated engine room, along with improvemnets to the exsisting main engine room. Monitoring lights and high level indicators as well as high level cut outs and auotmatic ammonia shut off to king valves installed.  Area lighting has been upgraded.\n\n\n\n On 7/14/2016 our facility was audited by our state compliance team. The outcome was very uplifting to find that our hard work and planning has been reccognised. This will not stop us from continuing to look at our proceedures and training in the event \"what if\" happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nNick Adams, Manager"
