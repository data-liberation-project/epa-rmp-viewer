The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\r\n\r\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \r\n\r\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, KERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of KERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY)`s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, KERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY) is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\n2.

The Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\n\r\nA Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis and an Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the KERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY) building.

The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\r\n\r\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place.

The five-year accident history\r\n\r\nThere have not been any known releases involving anhydrous ammonia at the KERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY) in the past five year history.  In the event of any such release, KERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY) has implemented a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3)to address such measures.\r\n\r\n6. The emergency response program\r\n\r\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. KERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY) has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. KERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY) conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nKERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY) is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows KERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY) to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of KERRY(FREDERICKSBURG FACILITY) employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
