The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has many elements including hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs. An RMP is required when facilities use EPA specified chemicals at quantities within the defined criteria. The RMP substances handled at the Facility are formaldehyde, methyl formate, hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen flouride, and titanium tetra chloride.  Ticona Polymers, Inc., Bishop Facility has two on-site partners, OXEA BISHOP LLC and BASF.  OXEA owns and operates the assets located at the Bishop Facility and prepares and submits its own RMP.  BASF owns the assets located at the Bishop facility, however is operated by Ticona employees.  Ticona incorporates RMP substances for BASF under Ticona?s RMP.\n\nThe information submitted in the RMP includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical descriptions, five year accidental history, which is zero, alternate release scenario and the worst case scenario. The RMP requires covered facilities to develop a worst case scenario for a release of covered chemicals from a site as well as a more realistic release scenario (alternate release scenarios). The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community awareness, prevention and emergency response planning, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely case scenario would ever occur. These scenarios are estimates required by EPA and are used to illustrate the importance of risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe B"
