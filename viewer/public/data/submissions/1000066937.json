Los Banos Processing Plant has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\n\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\n\n\n\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  California Dairies Inc. Los Banos Processing Plant interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\n\n\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation form.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\n\n\n\nAny release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia systems depending on the location of the release.

These procedures identify potential sources of release, administrative and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel, registered engineers, refrigeration experts, and certified refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment and administrative procedures and engineering controls.\n\n\n\nThere are additional full time Managers and operational employees at this facility in addition to Maintenance that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.  An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. This team activity is the core of California Dairies Inc.'s prevention program.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA-2    STATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe California Dairies Inc.

The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \n\n\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition Process 1 & 2 components are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\n\n\nA-4    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCalifornia Dairies Inc. Los Banos Processing Plant Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by California Dairies Inc. Los Banos Processing Plant is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nKey objectives of California Dairies Inc.'s Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by California Dairies Inc..

Los Banos Processing Plant certifies operators following completion of operator training and California Dairies Inc.'s confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n\n\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \n\n\n\nSecond, all California Dairies Inc. Los Banos Processing Plant employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\n\n\n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by California Dairies Inc. Processing Plant (Management of Change Procedure) \n\n \n\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, California Dairies Inc. Los Banos Processing Plant has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other hot work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a hot work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \n\n\n\nF"

The program includes a system for personnel to communicate with management on matters relating to occupational safety and health, including provisions designed to encourage employees to inform management of hazards at the worksite without fear of reprisal.\n\nThe safety communications system, one of the elements of the IIPP, is readily available and understandable to all affected employees. \n\nThe safety communication system includes:\n\n     Meetings \n\n     Training programs \n\n     Postings \n\n     Written communications \n\n     A system for anonymous notification by employees about hazards \n\n     Labor/management safety and health committees \n\n     Tail gate or tool box meetings\n\nIn addition to the above, during Construction the IIPP requires that Manager's conduct \"toolbox\" or \"tailgate\" safety meetings with their crews at least every ten working days to empha safety. Managers also hold periodic meetings to discuss safety problems and accidents that have occurred.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as SDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manual"

This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, external events and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\n\n\n\nTechnical Operating Specifications and Standard Operating Procedures\n\nThe Technical Operating Specifications TOS)and Standard Operating Procedures SOP's)are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel, oil pot, and evaporator etc. Topics include general information such items as;\n\n        Objectives \n\n        Special hazards \n\n    Location \n\n    Safety equipment needed \n\n    P&ID's  and Block Flow Diagrams\n\n    Technical operating specifications, \n\n    Electrical classifications \n\n    Step-by-step procedures\n\n    Specific warnings & PPE \n\n\n\nThe SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup, normal operation, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown. Various other safety programs and procedures are included.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAll employees who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the SDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and the individual's role in the emergency response plan or action plan.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.   Inspections, and ongoing maintenance based on industry standards are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief/vent systems and devices, emergency shutdo"

The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nPre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems. This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo insure that all the other areas of PSM program are followed, the company requires compliance audits.  At a minimum, these must be completed every three years. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAn incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Employee Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation proced"

Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\n\n\n\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and CUPA.\n\n\n\nHot Work and Safe Work Practices\n\nThis permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. Maintenance reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operation and the fire watch is completed.\n\n\n\nContractors and Contractor Qualifications\n\nThis site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere were no reportable ammonia releases at this facility during the last 5 years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has trained personnel to implement the Emergency Action Plan developed for this facility for flammables, fire, earthquake, hazardous materials and other emergencies. \n\n\n\nFacility personnel have coordinated with responding outside agencies such as Los Banos Fire and the Merced County Environmental Health Department, Division of Environmental Health.

Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency. In addition Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities capabilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release.\n\n\n\nDetailed plans have been developed to assist responders and company personnel.  All areas (zones) can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel/contractors are on site.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \n\n\n\nThe plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and controls for the system with the release.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches and controls are identified at the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe facility will assist outside agencies during large releases of hazardous chemicals. All personnel will evacuate to the meeting areas and be accounted for.\n\n\n\nA-7    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEmployees, community safety, the environment and product care are primary concerns at this facility.  The prevention program has been updated as a result of recent addition/changes of equipment.  A PHA study was conducted at California Dairies Inc. Los Banos Processing Plant and the study team made recommendations for additional safety and/or security.\n\n\n\nThe following table includes scheduled improvements to reduce accidental releases either in process or planned for at this time:  \n\n\n\nValve maintenance to the PM program; Perform no less then ever three years\n\nContinue pipe marking, tagging and painting of all systems\n\nComplete recommenda"
