Using RMP*Comp Version 1.07, the radius of toxicity is 0.1 mi.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nFederal-Mogul Blacksburg is in compliance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n Five-year accident history:\n\nOne employee's skin was exposed to chlorine on October 26, 2000. Danny Sweeney was removing a chlorine line for repair. The line had been evacuated but some residual chlorine remained in the line which was released onto Danny Sweeney. He rinsed off immediately after exposure and did not require medical treatment. No weather conditions were recorded since this event occurred indoors and did not affect the environment.  The on-site impact was the employees\u00bf injury. No offsite impacts are known.\n\nOne employee inhaled chlorine on December 28, 1998.  A pump malfunctioned after being repaired and discharged chlorine gas into the atmosphere.  The employee was sent to the hospital and recovered completely.  A minimal amount of chlorine was released from the cyanide destruct system.  No weather conditions were recorded since this event occurred indoors and did not affect the environment.  The on-site impact was the employees\u00bf injury. No offsite impacts are known.\n\nTwo employees were injured on February 20, 1995, slightly due to a chlorine release.  One inhaled chlorine, and the other suffered a minor burn.  The incident occurred because neither employee was familiar with the current chlorine system A minimal amount of chlorine was released, estimated to be no greater than one (1) lb.  No weather conditions were recorded as this event did not significantly affect the environment.  The on-site impacts were limited to the employees\u00bf injuries.  No offsite impacts are known.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan:\n\nThe Consolidated Emergency Response Plan, WI-0338, contains all the information regarding emergency responses at Federal-Mogul Blacksburg.

      "SummaryText": "Federal-Mogul Blacksburg is a facility that manufactures powertrain journal bearings. Casting, machining, and electroplating opeartions all take place within the plant. The facility is permitted to process 360,000 gallons of wastewater per day, most of which is generated by electroplating operations. Chlorine is used at the facility in the cyanide destruct process.  (Sulfur dioxide is used under the RMP threshold for chrome destruction.)\n\nAccidental release prevention / Emergency response policies:\nFederal-Mogul Blacksburg takes great care in preventing accidental releases.  The facility is subject to OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management, EPA Part 68 Risk Management Plan, and Consolidated Emergency Response Plan (Work Instruction - 0338).  These three manuals summarize the accidental release prevention techniques in place as well as emergency response policies at Federal-Mogul Blacksburg.\n\nStationary source: Federal-Mogul Blacksburg\n\nRegulated substances: Chlorine gas \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario:\nOne worst-case scenario, estimated to create the greatest area within the radius of the toxic endpoint, is defined for the release of chlorine containers over ten minutes. The passive mitigation of the chlorine system consists solely of the fact that the ton-containers are enclosed in an isolated building.  \n\nThe greatest distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles.  This value was calculated for chlorine gas using RMP*Comp Version 1.07. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\nThere are two (2) alternative scenarios reviewed for chlorine.  These scenarios are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  The alternative scenarios were chosen for probability of occurrence from possible piping releases and cylinder releases.\n\nThe first alternative scenario is a release from the piping directly attached to a ton container of chlorine.  Using RMP*Comp Version 1.07, the radius of toxicity is calculated to be 0.1 mi.\n\nThe second alternative scenario is a release from t"
