Integral\n\ncomponents of the manufacture of these products are two toxic chemicals (anhydrous ammonia,\n\nand phosphorus oxychloride) and five flammable chemicals (acetylene, dichlorosilane, pentane, trichlorosilane and trimethylchlorosilane).  Inventory exceeds the USEPA listed thresholds under the Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\ncodified at 40 CFR 68 for the two toxic and five flammable raw materials. SiVance has implemented a RMP program.  SiVance has an outstanding record in environmental, health, and safety programs.  The following sections outline this RMP program.\n\n\n\nOVERALL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nSiVance's Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the RMP program at the facility with the assistance of the Environmental Safety and Health (ES&H) Manager and the Process Safety Manager.  These individuals share the overall responsibility for ensuring that the facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  A primary responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the risk management program.  To ensure the RMP is appropriately developed and implemented, SiVance's ownership has assigned the duties of RMP Coordinator to the Plant Manager, a staff member who has the necessary background, training, and experience for that duty.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with proper authority, has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the USEPA RMP elements.  In addition, the RMP Coordinator works closely with appropriate staff to integrate the appropriate elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program as required by Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe following sections identify the specific responsibilities for various aspects of the RMP and PSM programs\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Process Safety Manager has the responsibility for (1) ensuring the off-site consequence analysis for the regulated processes are consiste"

The Plant Manager ensures that staff delegated RMP and PSM responsibilities for all program elements are assigned and maintained.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for process safety information, Section 68.65 of the RMP rule.  Process chemical information, process equipment information and process technology information is readily accessible for use.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS\n\nIn accordance with RMP Section 68.57, the RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for scheduling, conducting, and documenting that the PHAs were completed by trained personnel for the covered processes.  The RMP coordinator has delegated this responsibility to the Process Safety Manager who designates appropriately trained personnel from within the facility to participate in the PHAs. The RMP Coordinator may select outside contractors to lead the PHAs.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nIn accordance with RMP Section 68.71, the Plant Manager must ensure that complete and accurate operating procedures are in place for the regulated processes.
