In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers\u0092 recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the SWATS Plant has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00a768.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the BRPUA will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews, and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (\u00a768.50 & \u00a768.58).\n\n\tThe SWATS Plant complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR \u00a71910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute and the Texas Administrative Code.  The SWATS Plant is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The SWATS Plant is included in the Hood County Local Emergency Planning Committee\u0092s (LEPC) regional Emergency Response Plan.  Coordination activities are conducted in accordance with \u00a768.93 with the LEPC at least annually, and more frequently if necessary.  WTP operators and staff are trained to contact Hood County dispatch via 9-1-1 in the event of a release.  Hood County dispatch contacts the nearest first responder unit which coordinates the emergency response according to the County\u0092s Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00a768.90(b))."

      "SummaryText": "Brazos Regional Public Utility Agency (BRPUA) operates the Surface Water Advanced Treatment System (SWATS) Plant which is located at 5912 Matlock Road, Granbury, Hood County, Texas. The WTP provides potable water to Johnson County Special Utility District and Acton Municipal Utility District from Lake Granbury.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the SWATS Plant.  Up to 18,000 pounds (lbs) of chlorine may be stored at the SWATS Plant.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the SWATS Plant developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The SWATS Plant is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the SWATS General Manager is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  BRPUA\u0092s accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include commitments to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and f"
