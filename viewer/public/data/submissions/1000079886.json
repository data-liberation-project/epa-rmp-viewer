By addressing these matters this way, Perstorp Polyols is incorporating the management of EHSS issues in our work every day to reduce the risk of accidents that could result in harm to our employees, the public, and the environment.  Perstorp Polyols is also certified under the ISO 9001-2015 standard for Quality Systems.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Risk Management Planning process, Perstorp Polyols has worked closely with the Lucas County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  This close working relationship helps educate our emergency responders of the risks that are presented by our facility, the work that is on-going to prevent accidents from occurring and reduce the potential impact of an accident if it occurs, and make them more familiar with our facility.  We also benefit from this relationship in that we learn from the experience of our emergency responders in dealing with incidents at other facilities and the preventative actions that can be taken to further reduce the risk of an accident at our facility.  \r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols annually reports its EHSS performance in a Sustainability Report that is issued by the Perstorp Group separately from the annual financial report.  The annual Sustainability Report for the Perstorp Group can be found on the Perstorp web-site at www.perstorp.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols' Toledo facility\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols, Inc. is part of the Perstorp Group, a global company active in the application areas of chemistry and materials technology. Perstorp Polyols Inc began operations in Toledo, Ohio in 1977 with the purchase of a Pentaerythritol and Sodium Formate manufacturing facility. Since 1977 the operations have expanded to include manufacturing of Trimethylolpropane, Formaldehyde and concrete admixtures.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Perstorp Polyols completed construction and started a new state-of-the-art Formaldehyde plant.

The Formaldehyde is used both in house in the Pentaerythritol, Trimethylolpropane, and concrete admixture manufacturing processes and is sold externally for use in the manufacturing of particleboard, clothing and pharmaceuticals.  Formaldehyde is one of the chemicals covered by the requirements of the Risk Management Planning rule and is included as part of this submission because it is stored at the facility in excess of 15,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nPentaerythritol and Trimethylolpropane are used in the production of resins for paint and coatings, inks and adhesives, lubricants and urethane foam. Sodium Formate is used for paper bleaching, leather tanning, cattle feed and in the production of liquid detergents.  Acetaldehyde is a raw material used in the production of Pentaerythritol.  Storage of acetaldehyde is included in this submission because acetaldehyde is one of the chemicals covered by the requirements of the Risk Management Planning rule and it is stored at the Toledo facility in excess of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention program\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols considers prevention of accidental releases at all stages of the plant operation.  This prevention program begins with designing for safety in the processes.  All systems are designed according to accepted industry codes.  Perstorp Polyols plants and operating systems are designed and operated with redundant safety systems and instrumentation.  The purpose of these systems is to provide back-up safety protection in the event a primary safety system fails.  Modern technology is used in the design and construction of processes.  All new or modified plants are inspected and reviewed before start-up.  Tanks used to store chemicals are placed in concrete secondary containment areas to prevent possible leaks or releases from reachi"

Based on this guidance, none of the situations will have an impact on residential areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols has a commitment to continuous improvement in the areas of safety, health and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated in the semi-annual audits of our environmental management system by independent verifiers, the weekly safety and environmental training program for our employees, as well as our on going Perstorp Performance System (PPS) process.  Internal audits of our operations are on going throughout the year.  The PPS process gives our employees the opportunity to submit recommendations for changes with the plants or procedures to improve safety, environmental protection, operational efficiency, and many other areas.  A behavior based safety program began in 2008 to reinforce safe work practices and identify conditions or actions that put employees or the environment at risk.  Several successful actions have been taken to reduce risk to employees and the environment as part of this program, known as Take Care on the site.\r\n\r\nThe site has migrated its control systems to a more robust and modern platform (Emerson Delta V)  The site has installed protective interlocks for Acetaldehyde addition and is increasing the fire protection capacity in its Formaldehyde plant.  The site has also switched heat transfer fluids in the Formaldehyde plant to reduce fire potential."

Most tanks are equipped with high level alarms that alert operators that the tanks are nearly full and some of these alarms are equipped to shutdown the pump that is supplying the tank to prevent overfilling.\r\n\r\nAnother step of the prevention program includes the maintenance of the plants and their safety systems.  Preventative maintenance on processes is regularly conducted to protect against equipment failures.  While this does not guarantee that equipment will not occasionally break down, it reduces the risk that a problem will occur.  Safety systems are inspected and tested regularly to ensure that they will be operational if a problem develops within the process.  This includes annual or semiannual inspection and testing of fire suppression systems by outside contractors as well as inspection and testing of pressure relief devices within the processes.  Systems that are designed to shutdown when an upset occurs are often tested during plant downtime to ensure they will function to shut the process down if the upset condition occurs.\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols employees prevent accidents by operating the processes in a safe and efficient manner.  Our operators are well trained in operating instructions for the processes.  They were involved in the development of many of these operating instructions, either by reviewing the instructions when they were being written or by writing the instructions themselves.  Written unloading and operating instructions are regularly reviewed and kept up to date.\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols believes that safe design, good maintenance practices, and well-trained operators are very important parts of the prevention program.

There are many government regulations that require emergency plans.  In 1996, OSHA, EPA, Coast Guard, and Department of Transportation worked together to develop a uniform plan for emergencies.  That plan, called the Integrated Contingency Plan, is used at Perstorp Polyols to provide a single source of information and procedures in the event of an emergency.  Copies of the plan have been provided to the Toledo Fire and Police Departments, several local hospitals, the City of Toledo Division of Environmental Services and the Ohio EPA so they are aware of the emergency plan at Perstorp Polyols.\r\n\r\nTraining is provided to our employees on the plan at least once a year.

On April 28th, 2018, a temporary tank containing 12% Formaldehyde solution in water was overfilled.  The liquid flowed into a temporary secondary containment, which subsequently leaked.  Approximately 300 gallons of 12% Formaldehyde solution was released from the secondary containment.  The liquid flowed down a driveway and collected in an low spot on the plant driveway that collects rainwater.  Approximately 1,200 gallons of released material and rainwater were collected.  Soil and gravel were excavated and replaced from the area. There was no environmental or off-site impacts to the release.\r\n\r\nContributing causes were lack of hazard analysis on a temporary change and operator inattention to the process of filling the vessel.  The site has put corrective actions in place to rectify these two opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios\r\n\r\nPerstorp Polyols is submitting two situations that meet the EPA criteria for worst-case release scenarios.  One situation covers the storage of acetaldehyde and the second situation covers the storage of formaldehyde.  Perstorp Polyols is also submitting two situations that are required under EPA criteria for alternative release scenarios; one for acetaldehyde and one for formaldehyde.
