SULFONATION PROCESS\r\n\r\n     A. Process Chemistry\r\n\r\n           The sulfonation process is a dechlorination step to\r\n        remove the total combined chlorine residual that exists\r\n        after chlorination.  Effluent requirements for the\r\n        removal of the total combined chlorine residual, with\r\n        the objective of reducing the toxic effects of\r\n        chlorinated effluents on receiving-stream biota.\r\n\r\n           Sulfur dioxide gas successfully removes free\r\n        chlorine, monochloramine, dichloramine, nitrogen\r\n        trichloride, and poly-n-chlor compounds.  For the\r\n        overall reaction between sulfur dioxide and chlorine,\r\n        the stoichiometric weight ratio of sulfur dioxide to\r\n        chlorine is 0.9:1.  In practice, it has been found that\r\n        about 1.0 mg/l of sulfur dioxide will be required for\r\n        the dechlorination of 1.0 mg/l chlorine residual.\r\n        Because the reactions of sulfur dioxide and chlorine\r\n        and chloramines are nearly instantaneous, contact time\r\n        is usually not a factor and contact chambers are not\r\n        used, but rapid and positive mixing at the point of\r\n        application is an absolute requirement.\r\n\r\n           The various reactions involved in the sulfur dioxide\r\n        dechlorination process are shown below.  The first\r\n        reaction is the formation of sulfurous acid in the\r\n        sulfonator inductor:\r\n\r\n        SO2 + H2O  H2SO3\r\n\r\n        The sulfurous acid reacts with the various chlorine\r\nresidual species as follows:\r\n\r\n            HOCl + H2SO3  HCl + H2SO4\r\n            NH2Cl + H2SO3 + H2O  NH4Cl + H2SO4\r\n            NHCl2 + 2H2SO3 + 2H2O  NH4Cl + HCl + 2H2SO4\r\n            NCl3 + 3H2SO3 + 3H2"

The free chlorine\r\n        dominates the nature of the reactions.  These often\r\n        result in development of obnoxious compounds such as\r\n        nitrogen trichloride, NCl3.  To minimize these effects,\r\n        high quality water is often used as chlorinator feed\r\n        water and flash mixing is required at the point where\r\n        the chlorine water is applied to prevent the\r\n        development of localized low pH conditions.  In dilute\r\n        solution and at pH levels above about 4, the\r\n        equilibrium shown above is displaced greatly to the\r\n        right, and very little chlorine exists as such in\r\n        solution.

The inductor is\r\n        used to create a vacuum that is used to draw the sulfur\r\n        dioxide gas from the sulfur dioxide container through\r\n        the sulfonator, and into the inductor.  The sulfonator\r\n        meters the volume of sulfur dioxide to the inductor,\r\n        the sulfur dioxide dissolves in the water to form\r\n        sulfurous acid.  From the inductor, the sulfurous acid\r\n        solution flows to the point where it is injected into\r\n        the wastewater.\r\n\r\n     D.

In  the event that there is a  fire  or  a\r\n            release  of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, the person(s)\r\n            discovering  the  fire or release is  to  immediately\r\n            report  the  incident  to the Operations  Manager  or\r\n            person designated in his place.  If the emergency  is\r\n            critical,  call  911  before calling  the  Operations\r\n            Manager.   The Operations Manager will call the  Fire\r\n            Department   if   necessary  and   determine   if   a\r\n            reportable quantity (RQ) release has occurred.\r\n\r\n                  Information   to  be  reported   to   emergency\r\n            responders   should  include  the   following   (upon\r\n            calling 911):\r\n\r\n            \u00b7    Chemical(s) released,\r\n            \u00b7    Estimated quantity released,\r\n            \u00b7    Time and duration of the release,\r\n            \u00b7    Evacuation and/or sheltering plans, and\r\n            \u00b7    Name and telephone number of the person(s) to be contacted"

EMERGENCY ALARM SYSTEM\r\n\r\n            If a release of chlorine occurs, the chlorine sensors\r\n        will  sound  an  audible alarm and  activate  the  strobe\r\n        light  on top of the building.  A signal is also sent  to\r\n        the  main building.  THERE ARE NO OTHER AUDIBLE OR VISUAL\r\n        ALARMS  AT  THE  PLANT THAT WILL SIGNAL THAT  A  CHLORINE\r\n        RELEASE HAS OCCURRED.\r\n\r\n            If  a  release of sulfur dioxide occurs,  the  sulfur\r\n        dioxide  sensors will sound an audible alarm and activate\r\n        the  strobe  light on top of the building.  A  signal  is\r\n        also  sent  to  the main building.  THERE  ARE  NO  OTHER\r\n        AUDIBLE  OR  VISUAL ALARMS AT THE PLANT THAT WILL  SIGNAL\r\n        THAT A SULFUR DIOXIDE RELEASE HAS OCCURRED.\r\n\r\n            A  wind  sock,  located on top  of  the  chlorination\r\n        building,   indicates  wind  direction.   All   employees\r\n        should note the wind direction and move up-wind or cross-\r\n        wind to a release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\n     B. TYPES OF EVACUATION\r\n\r\n            In  the event of a release, employees will either  be\r\n        required to evacuate the plant or be sheltered in  place.\r\n        This  will be dependent upon wind direction, severity  of\r\n        the  release, and in what part of the plant  the  release\r\n        has occurred.\r\n\r\n     C. EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND SHELTERING\r\n\r\n            In  the event of an emergency, the Operations Manager\r\n        or  his designee will determine if employees will need to\r\n        evacuate  the  plant  or  be  sheltered  in  place.    If\r\n        evacuation  is necessary, employees will be  directed  to\r\n        report to one of the four following fencelines:\r\n\r\n        \u00b7    North,\r\n        \u00b7    East,\r\n        \u00b7    West, or\r\n        \u00b7    South\r\n\r\n            Evacuation to these locations will be dependent  upon\r\n        wind"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nWe have adopted this Program in order to implement 40 C.F.R. 68, the federal requirements regulating Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\nOur Program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions of the standard.  We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Galveston believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City of Galveston Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide, where the substances can be \u00bfadsorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel\u00bf.\n\nThe City of Galveston has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.

Above all, all employees know where the phone numbers of the first responders are located should a release occur.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Main Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.\n\nChemical\tMaximum Inventory (lb.)\tThreshold Quantity (lb.)\nChlorine\t\t36,000\t\t2,500\nSulfur Dioxide\t\t28,000\t\t5,000\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario as defined in 40 C.F.R. 68.  A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are heavier than air.  The model\u00bfs input parameters are summarized in the table below.\n\nSLAB Input Parameters\n\tWorst-Case Scenario\tAlternative Scenario\nWindspeed (m/s)\t1.5\t3\nAtmospheric Stability Class\tF\tD\nTemperature (?

OPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\n        A.  The  City  of  Galveston  developed  and  implemented\r\n        written  standard  operating procedures  (SOPs)  that  is\r\n        consistent  with the Process Safety Information  (Section\r\n        1  of  this  Program).   Those procedures  provide  clear\r\n        instructions  for  safely conducting activities  involved\r\n        in  the  chlorine  and sulfur dioxide systems  consistent\r\n        with  the  process safety information.  They address  the\r\n        following:\r\n\r\n        1.  The steps for each operating phase:\r\n\r\n            a.  Initial startup;\r\n            b.  Normal operation;\r\n            c.  Normal shutdown.\r\n\r\n        2.  Operating limits:\r\n\r\n            a.  Consequences of deviation;\r\n            b.  Steps required to correct and/or avoid deviation;\r\nand\r\n            c.  Equipment.\r\n\r\n        B.   Copies  of  the  operating  procedures  are  readily\r\n        accessible  in the Superintendent\u00bfs office  to  employees\r\n        who  work in or maintain the chlorine and sulfur  dioxide\r\n        systems.\r\n\r\n        C.  The  operating procedures are reviewed  as  often  as\r\n        necessary  to assure that they reflect c"
