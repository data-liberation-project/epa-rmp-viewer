Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Springfield FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous). The Sulfur Dioxide, and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide, are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 117,500 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), is present at our facility in quantities of 27,500  lbs..\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as RMP COMP VER. 1.06 for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program  2 toxic substances as a class"

Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  .0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a 150 lb. CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over. 10 minutes.   With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.10miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a 2000 lb. SULFUR DIOXIDE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 200 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. \n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996).  \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is     ?WHAT IF?  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years "
