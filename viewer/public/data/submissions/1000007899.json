This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and safe design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facilityA?s processes.  The Company policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nNatural gas entering the plant via pipelines is separated from any free liquids, dehydrated by molecular sieves and cooled in the gas-to-gas heat exchanger (Stationary Source). Inlet gas is further cooled through the turbo expander and fed to the demethanizer (Stationary Source). The resulting natural gas liquid extracted from the inlet gas referred to as A?Y-gradeA? (Regulated Substance) is pumped from the surge tank (Stationary Source) and is shipped from the plant via a transmission pipeline. The methane (referred to as residue gas) is shipped from the plant via a transmission pipeline as well. Transmission pipelines are not stationary sources for purposes of the RMP. \n\nThe substances handled at the Plant were evaluated for toxic characteristics and it was determined that there are no toxic substances exceeding the threshold quantity handled at the Plant.  \n\nThe Y-grade is a flammable substance is present at the Plant in excess of the threshold quantity and, therefore, is subject to the RMP requirements.  Based on the worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors; therefore, the Plant is classified as Program level 3 under the RMP.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endp"

A yield factor of 10% of the available energy released in the explosion is used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  In case of the Plant, Y-grade would be the worst-case flammable release with 0.39-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nFlammable Substances Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nThere are no other substances that can be considered in the alternative-case scenario.  \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThere are no toxic substances held above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required for this Plant.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program implemented at the Plant.  Because the processes at the Plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the PSM program at the Plant is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent and/or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors an"

These programs include safety committees (which are made up of a cross-section of employees and supervisors), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, hazcom, etc.). Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written Process Safety Information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI is useful to the operators, team performing PHAs, those in charge of employee training, contractors and third-party vendors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans and emergency action plans.  PSI is incorporated into the PSM Manual and is readily available to all employees.  \n\nThe Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemicals properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nThe Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with the written procedure"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if-Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the hazard analysis results are updated and revalidated periodically.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  The refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers: (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  The Plant personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\n\nThe Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection:  \n1.    Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control :\n1.    Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n2.    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n3.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n4.    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n5.    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n6.    Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation:\n1.    Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n2.    Deluge system for specific equipment\n3.    Personnel trained in emergency procedures\n4.    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past five (5) years there have been no accidental releases.\n\nEMERGENCY PROCEDURE INFORMATION\n\nThe Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment in the event of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedure addresses notification of federal, state and local emergency response agencies as appropriate and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Plant facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes infor"

      "SummaryText": "ming and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Plant is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the Plant provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the Plant.\n"
