If an accidental release should\noccur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities to mitigate\nany release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n2. Facility information\n\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to other\nfertilizer dealers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received and stored for blending into fertilizers for crop production\nnutrients.\n\n-The maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in our 30,000 and 18,000 gallon\nstorage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank c\nholding 150,000 pounds.\n\n-\n\n3. The worse-case release scenario.\n\na. The worse- case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes. . The maximum quantity released would be 14,020 pounds,\nwhich represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by\ndesign standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.63 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia K.61.1\", published by the American National Standards\nInstitute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History \n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia In the past five years that\n\n have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor to our\nknowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property\ndamage or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n. \n\n"

Planned changes to Improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to\nassess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\nsafety recommendations for implementation at this time. April 28, 1999"
