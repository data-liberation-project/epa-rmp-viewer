Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\n\n\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Watonwan Farm Service, Mankato, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substances Handled: \n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and handled for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. The facility will have 1-45,000 gallon storage tank; and additional available capacity of approximately 20,000 gallons in nurse tanks when the nurse tanks are on site during the spring planting and fall harvest seasons. The maximum quantity handled would be a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections. Visual checks are to be conducted daily at the facility.\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have:\n\na) Caused any death, inj"

The plan includes a specific section on NH3 Releases and what to do in the event of a release. The annual emergency action plan training was held in July 2014 and August 2014. Additional review of emergency response training fo anhydrous ammonia was part of the annual anhydrous ammonia training that was held in September 2014.\n\nb) Will provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc) Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\nd) Has Safety Data Sheets for anhydrous ammonia as part of their emergency response plan information.\n\ne) A Minnesota AWAIR (A Workplace Accident and Injury Reduction) program in place and is committed to a safe working environment as well as protection of the community and environment in which we operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Currently, there is no storage tanks and no anhydrous ammonia on site.  This RMP will be updated as required once the facility becomes operational. \n\n"
