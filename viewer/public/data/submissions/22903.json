As part of this commitment, the Company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the 'RMP Rule'). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Bellingham. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the basis for public communication of the Risk Management Program for the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and  (b) the accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide, and ethyl ether) - see topic 1.3;\n \n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4;\n \n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6; and\n\n4. a management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Program.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide a"

When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nGP/Bellingham limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at GP/Bellingham consists of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP Rule.

There are no off-site consequences from any alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nGeorgia-Pacific West, Inc. has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) Prevention Program. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 Prevention Program would become a requirement for these processes as well.

The following effects could occur at the endpoint distances. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, such as chlorine dioxide, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\nWhen considering the explosion of a flammable substance, such as ethyl ether, people within the endpoint distance are likely to be knocked down by the blast. Windows at the endpoint distance could shatter, and the potential for structural damage to buildings exists, although a building collapse is unlikely.  Serious injury is possible from people being knocked down by the force of the blast, flying glass or falling objects.\n\nWhen considering the fire hazard of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are likely to receive second-degree burns over the exposed parts of their bodies if they cannot find cover or otherwise escape the heat of the flame. The burns are likely to require hospitalization.\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific West, Inc. These requirements include:\n\n- one worst-case release scenario for all toxic substances in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n- one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n- one worst-case release scenario for the flammable substance in the Prog"

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration, based on the EPA RMP*Comp Model approach, is 1.6 miles. The United States Census indicates that approximately 19,171 people live within this distance.  Several public receptors are also located within this distance (e.g.,  industrial facilities, public and private elementary school and a high school, a hospital,  several churches, several recreational parks, and numerous subdivisions). There are also several environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the failure of the discharge piping from the storage vessel.  The transfer pump will feed the leak.  Such a failure would allow chlorine dioxide solution to discharge from the pipe at a rate of 500 gallons per minute for 15 minutes before the leak is detected and stopped.  The solution will spill inside a containment that directly drains to a closed sewer.  This containment and sewer drain will contain the release and mitigate evaporation.
