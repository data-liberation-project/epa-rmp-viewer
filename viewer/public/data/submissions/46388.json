Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is the policy of the TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC., Dakota City, Nebraska facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC owned activities at this facility.\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC.'s management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n2. Facility Description\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC operates a cattle slaughter and processing facility, and a hides tannery at this location.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Dakota City, Nebraska facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\n* 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\n\nThe key concepts in TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.  TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia and chlorine systems, and for conducting the process safety review for the methane system.  TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of "

Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.  Members of TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC's emergency response team receive semiannual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed.\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\nTyson Fresh Meats, Inc has had one accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years from the Dakota City, Nebraska facility. The release was 1,150 pounds. There were two employees taken to the hospital for observation and then released. No one off site was injured, and no personnel outside the facility were evacuated.  The Dakota City, Nebraska Waste Water Treatment Plant has had one accidental release of Biogas.  The release was <10 pounds. One contractor was taken to the hospital, treated and released. No one off site was injured, and no persons outside the facility were evacuated.  The Dakota City, Nebraska facility has not had a release of chlorine that has affected the public or environment or injured any employees on site within the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nEmergency Contact information is split based on the Hides/Tannery/Waste Water Treatment Plant business at Dakota City and on the Dakota City Complex business.\n\nEmergency Contact for the Hides/Tannery/WWTP is Ed Thiele.

TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC's employees, trained in the safe operation of the methane system, will close manual shutoff valves to terminate the flow of methane if the valves can be safely approached.  For all other scenarios, TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC's employees will evacuate the area and allow off-site responders to respond to the emergency.\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC has met with the local fire department to review the methane, chlorine and ammonia systems annually to review coordination and communication procedures.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC completes a thorough review of the ammonia systems, chlorine systems, and the methane flare system each time a design change is implemented.
