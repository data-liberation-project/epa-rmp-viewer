KNC's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  Ammonia is also injected into an ammonia pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.  Carbon dioxide, a by-product of the ammonia manufacturing process, is sold to third party entities, liquefied in the facility's CO2 plant and sold, used in the UAN plant, or vented to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Beatrice Nitrogen Plant in amounts above threshold quantity.  Chlorine was reported in previous RMPs, b"

All chlorine cylinders have been removed from the facility and replaced with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), which is not an RMP substance, for use in the cooling tower.   An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 Prevention Program requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n  \r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\r\n\r\n-Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n-Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n-Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n-Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped minimize the severity of chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n-\tRemoving chlorine in the cooling towers and replacing it with sodium hypochlorite thereby reducing the risk of a toxic release from the facility.\r\n-\tMinimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia"
