The plant is situated adjacent to the Ouachita River and Louisiana Highway 2 in northeast Ouachita Parish.  The plant employs approximately 160 full time personnel. The facility operates continuously 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  Sterlington is a small community with a population around 3300, located approximately 10 miles north of Monroe, Louisiana.\n\nThe ANGUS facility consists of six (6) separate manufacturing operations including a nitroparaffins plant, nitric acid plant, nitroparaffin derivatives plant, derivatives crystals plant, isopropyl hydroxylamine (IPHA) plant and a hydrogen plant.  In addition ANGUS operates and maintains a shipping facility in support of the process plants for both the distribution of incoming raw materials and outgoing manufactured products and a pilot plant to scale up the manufacture of new products and to enhance the production of existing commercial products. \n\nANGUS' processes at Sterlington are covered by 29 CFR 1910.119, OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  Process hazard analysis of all covered processes have been completed and several process studies  have been revalidated in conformance with specified hazard review requirements.\n\nREGULATED (68.130) SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nANGUS Chemical Company handles the following materials that are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Plan at the Sterlington facility:\n\nMATERIALS CLASSIFIED AS TOXIC:\n\nSulfur Dioxide - 7446-09-5  A chemical used in our nitroparaffin process, \nmaximum amount stored = 106,100 lbs.\nFormaldehyde - 50-00-0 Raw material for nitroparaffin derivative process,\n maximum amount stored = 250,000 lbs\nChlorine  - 7782-50-5   Water treatment additive,\n maximum amount stored = 5 tons \nAmmonia - 7664-41-7   Raw material for the nitric"

Standard operating procedures are utilized to ensure that material transfers are conducted in a consistent manner appropriate for formaldehyde.\n\n\n FLAMMABLE:\tPropane.  Material leaks from the nitration section at a rate of 200 pounds per minute for 10 minutes.  Using release modeling program AARCHIE\u00ae and assuming ambient temperature of 85 deg F, 50% humidity with a wind speed of 3 meters/second, stability class D would result in levels of concern for the IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) of 2100 ppm at a distance of 0.041 miles and and an end point of 5 kw/sq meter for 40 seconds (the thermal dose equivalent to receive a second degree burn) at a distance of 0.03 miles or an area of concern no greater than the immediate area of ANGUS' Sterlington facility.  To limit this distance, ANGUS Chemical Company utilizes administrative controls to normally limit the amount of propane stored in the propane vaporizer upstream of the nitration section to less than 30% of its capacity, conducts annual audits of the system, maintains the storage and handling equipment in sound mechanical condition and utilizes employee training and comprehensive operating procedures to ensure that the equipment is properly operated and maintained in a consistent manner. To detect release at an early stage, gas detection is utilized at the propanevaporizer. Gas detectors are set to sound an audible alarm and the propane vaporizer is protected by a deluge system.\n\nTrimethylamine:  Material leaks from two (2) inch hole in bottom of tank at a rate of 200 pounds per minute for 10 minutes.

To limit this distance, ANGUS Chemical Company utilizes administrative controls to mormally limit the amount of trimethylamine stored in the trimethylamine storage tank to less than 85% of its capacity, conducts annual audits of the system, maintains the storage and handling equipment in sound mechanical conditions and utilizes employee training and comprehensive operating procedures to ensure that the equipment is properly operated and maintained in a consistent manner. \n\n\nDETONABLE:\tNitromethane.  Material detonates within a switch tank involving 1000 pounds of material.  Using modeling program AARCHIE\u00ae and assuming ambient temperature of 85 deg F, 50% humidity with a wind speed of 3 meters/second, stability class D would result in a level of concern of 1 psi over pressure within a radius of 0.10 miles from the switch tank.  To limit this distance, ANGUS Chemical Company employs strict control on all process vessels and equipment that are in nitromethane service.  These include mandatory use of blast containment bunkers, detonation traps on all lines, use of pressure relief devices on any portion of a NM line that could be valved off and entrap NM, utilization of fixed deluge and/or water spray system on all exposed NM piping, and continuous air separation between NM process equipment and NM storage.  In addition, administrative controls have been implemented including annual audits of all NM systems, mechanical integrity on all process equipment, extensive personnel training on NM hazards and special handling requirements, comprehensive operating procedures, and controls to prevent and/or safely contain vessels that have a poten"

Staffing is based on production and regulatory needs and personnel are selected on their technological knowledge, experience and abilities to operate and support operations within the facility.  A strong cadre of chemical engineers are employed in engineering, production operations and administrative support; mechanical engineers and industrial technologist are involved in plant maintenance programs including mechanical integrity; professional safety personnel are employed to provide oversight and direction on safety issues related to personnel, property protection and process safety management including the maintenance of a full time Process Hazard Analysis function. \n\nTRAINING:  ANGUS utilizes an extensive training program to educate all plant operators.  Our plant operator training program is a key element to the safety of our operation.  The site training coordinator provides continuous training to both new and experienced operators.  \n\n Training requirements are identified by each department. The Regulatory Affairs and Transportation departments, with assistance from the Training Department, ensure that regulatory training requirements are identified, defined and maintained.  Function specific training requirements are identified by each department.  The manager, supervisors, and employees of each department determine the function specific training needed for each of the jobs within their departments.\n\nThe Training Department and department training coordinator compile these training requirements for each job a job curriculum.  Each job curriculum identifies all of the training requirements for each job and is maintained by the Trai"
