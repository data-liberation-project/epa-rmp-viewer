(Plumrose) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to release of Ammonia (anhydrous) are documented in the Risk Management Program (RMP) document. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs will be fully implemented by Plumrose personnel and contractors and are coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts. \n\n\n\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nPlumrose provides employment for approximately 304 workers in Elkhart, Indiana. This facility is a meat processing plant owned by Danish Crown, Randers, Denmark. The corporate headquarters are at Plumrose USA, Inc., 1901 Butterfield Road, Suite 305, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. Plumrose receives and processes raw meat (pork bellies). The pork bellies are processed by washing, injecting, and smoking on site. After processing, the pork bellies are then sliced, and packaged for retail sale. From the time the pork bellies are received and throughout the processes conducted, the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing an Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Plumrose will complete a compilation of written process safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The PHA was on conducted on May 29, 2014 using the process sa"

This process safety information will include information pertaining to the hazards of Ammonia (anhydrous), information pertaining to the technology of the Ammonia refrigeration process, and information pertaining to the equipment utilized in the Ammonia refrigeration process. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Plumrose will update and re-validate the PHA as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The PHA will be conducted using the methodology specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and will be performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including at least one employee who has expertise in the Ammonia refrigeration process, and at least one member knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology used. A system will be established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Plumrose will develop and implement written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where Ammonia (anhydrous) is utilized. These written operating procedures will be consistent with the process safety information and address steps for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. These operating procedures will be readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the Ammonia refrigeration process. These operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in process che"
