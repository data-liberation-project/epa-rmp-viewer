These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases and help achieve that goal.\n\n5.0 Five-Year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for all chemical releases that occur at our facility.  In the past 5 years, we have had one accidental release of an EPA RMP covered material that involved onsite or offsite impact, as defined by the EPA RMP rule mandated by the CAA section 112(r).\n\nOn 5/19/97, a release occurred from the 1,1 difluoroethane reactor/tar system. A total of 11,500 pounds of hydrogen fluoride was released over a 40 minute period. The immediate area was evacuated and neighboring downwind plants were contacted.  Employees at several of these plants evacuated.  Nine DuPont employees and contractors given precautionary treatment for hydrogen fluoride exposure.  None of the exposures resulted in recordable injuries.  One offsite business notified DuPont that one of their employees reported exposure and received first-aid treatment.\n\nWe conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the key factors that caused the release.  It is our philosophy and practice that all accidental releases, regardless of size and significance, are thoroughly investigated.\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nIn order to promptly respond to emergencies, it is essential to detect such situations quickly.  In addition to regular patrols and process monitoring by trained operating personnel, we employ remote sensors for chlorine and hydrogen fluoride and closed-circuit television monitori"

In addition to this emphasis on preventing accidental releases, we are prepared to respond to any emergency situation that may occur.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and the use of substances covered by this regulation\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental  chemical releases\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals covered by this regulation\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- An overview of planned improvements at our facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, or the environment\n- The certifications this regulation requires us to provide\n- The detailed data elements about our risk management program\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe DuPont Fluoroproducts site is located along the Ohio River in Jefferson County, Kentucky just southwest of the city of Louisville in an area known locally as Rubbertown.  We operate two processes using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  One process produces HCFC-22 with HFC-23 and hydrogen chloride as by-products.  The second process produces HFC-152a (1,1 difluoroethane) and vinyl fluoride.  Each process uses fluorine based technology and operates independently.
