      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Shenandoah, IA Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Shenandoah, IA Facility located two miles north of Shenandoah, IA at 4197 175th Street Shenandoah, IA 51601.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Shenandoah, IA Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Shenandoah, IA Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this new registration in response to the EPA Audit conducted on 9/14/2016.  The original EPA RMP Report (EPA RMP ID No. 1000 0001 2461) included the inventory at this location but the original EPA RMP Report had the incorrect address (i.e. 303 Northwest Road).  The Facility located at 303 Northwest Road is used to provide storage for the nurse tank inventory.  To provide clarification, Helena is filing this EPA RMP Report to represent this location as being used to store the stationary pressure vessels.  The original EPA RMP Report will reflect storage of nurse tanks only.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or u"

      "SummaryText": "pdated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Shenandoah, IA Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,600 gallon) and then transferred to two (2) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tanks.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the on-site stationary storage tanks and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks when preparing for the seasonal demand.  As discussed above, the nurse tanks are stored at 303 Northwest Road in Shenandoah, IA.  When preparing for the seasonal demand, nurse tanks are transported from the 303 Northwest Road location to this location where they are filled with anhydrous ammonia.  When filled, the nurse tanks are transported back to the 303 Northwest Road location for temporary storage until the customer picks them up or Helena personnel transport them to the customer.  Helena performs the transfer operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that is operated at this Facility.  The covered process includes anhydrous ammonia Storage and Handling.  The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) "

      "SummaryText": "scenario was completed for the storage and handling covered process as well.  The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a 30-second release from a ruptured 3-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during a loading or unloading operation.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Branch Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Shenandoah, IA Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Shenandoah, IA Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Shenandoah, IA Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Shenandoah, IA Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Fremont County LEPC and the Shenandoah Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Shenandoah, IA Facility.\n\n"
