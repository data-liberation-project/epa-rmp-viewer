Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Conagra Brands pudding pack & David Sunflower Seeds processing facility located in Waterloo, Iowa is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Waterloo Fire Department for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia which is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  The system is calculated to contain 16,205 lbs. of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the refrigeration system(s) is to provide cold storage capabilities for the perishable products.  The ammonia is used to cool glycol that is then used in the plant for the required cooling.  There is one Engine Room located on the east area of the building.\n\n\n\nDue to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nHere is a summary of some of our recent RMP activity:\n\n\n\na. April 7, 2011 - Initial RMP Submittal\n\nb. April 8, 2016 - De-Registered the RMP as the system was pumped out and recharged with 8,898 lbs. of ammonia back in 2013\n\nc. November 8, 2016 - Upd"
