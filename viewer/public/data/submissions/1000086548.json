If able to safely do so, in the event of a fire, explosion or hazardous material release emergency, facility personnel will press the emergency stop (E-Stop) to activate the local alarm and initiate a process emergency shut down. Emergency shutdown will also be initiated by the control system under a number of scenarios. When the local alarm sounds, or if a fire or explosion occurs, facility personnel evacuate to a safe distance and contact local emergency responders in accordance with the facility's Emergency Action Plan. \r\n\r\n(f)\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe facility is new; no changes are planned to improve safety."

The hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide are directed to a thermal oxidizer where the hydrogen sulfide is destroyed. The treated gas is directed to scavenger units where traces of hydrogen sulfide are adsorbed onto solid media. The cleaned renewable natural gas is further compressed and loaded onto trucks for transport to a remote station for injection into a natural gas pipeline.\r\n\r\n(c)\tTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe facility has established an accidental release prevention program, which establishes the protocols needed to safely handle and use methane.  The plan is designed to prevent and minimize the effects of an unplanned, sudden or non-sudden incidents involving methane.\r\n\r\nSpecifically this plan protects the community using a combination of operating procedures and safe work practices, equipment design, emergency operations and shut-down procedures, design, detection, and employee training and education.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the digester gas cannot be treated, there is a process upset, the gas does not meet specifications, the thermal oxidizer is not available or trucks are not available to receive the cleaned gas, the gas is directed to a flare for destruction.\r\n\r\nThe facility is equipped with explosive gas detectors, hydrogen sulfide detectors and flame detectors. The process controls are programmed to initiate an emergency shutdown and sound an alarm if any of these detectors are activated. \r\n\r\nThe requirements of the accidental release prevention program will be implemented as an on-going compliance policy to ensure that methane is safely stored, handled and used by the facility.
