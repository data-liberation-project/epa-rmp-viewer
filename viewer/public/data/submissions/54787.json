All applicable procedures of the federal Program are adhered to. The Fertizona Yuma LLC emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nFertizona Yuma LLC stores and blends liquid fertilizer for sale and application to farmland. The facility stores the following quantities of regulated substances:\n?    Anhydrous Ammonia - 180,000 pounds\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the toxic substance released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint? selected by the EPA (0.14 mg/L for anhydrous ammonia). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, ?to estimate the population potentially affected.? The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios for the process, identified as ?worst case release? and ?alternative release scenario.?  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n?    High level of training of the operators.\n?    Preventative maintenance programs.\n?    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n?    Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n?    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases at Fertizona Yuma LLC in th"
