Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 75,200 pounds.  \nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in 3 stationary storage tanks.  [1 @ 12,000 gallon; 2 @ 6,000 gallon] on site.  86,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks.  We have no rail cars for temporary storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 162,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 56,000 pounds.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO.\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that Dakota Fertilizer has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia release in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds.  "

It shoud be noted that Dakota Fertilizer has not had a release of this type.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PRGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the quidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nWe are required to conduct our own audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal state and local regulations are covered.  The manager conducts comprehensive annual audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe location has a 'site safety coordinator'.  This coordinator monitors the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory recordkeeping, conduct regular safety meetings, and conduct employee training.  The site safety coordinator acts as the location emergency contact.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\nThis facility is a wholesale farm "

Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck and is handled and stored on site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops. \n\nTraining is provided to all employees ar least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the requlations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training. \n \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an accident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, Dakota Fertilizer has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200).  The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuation and LEPC coordination.\n\nPLANNED CHANGE"
