This program calculates the theoretical \"end point\", defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life threatening health effects.\"  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Section-Dutton WTP involves the failure of one 1-ton container releasing 2,000 lbs of chlorine gas over a 10-minute time frame.  RMP*Comp, using boundary conditions such as urban area, 1.5 m/sec wind speed and no mitigation features yielded a toxic endpoint of 2.0 miles (see attached figure WCase.jpg).  The population within this area, measured in ArcView using census block polygons and the 1990 census data (adjusted for growth) gave 1,270 as a first approximation.\n\nThe alternate-case scenario (more likely) involves the failure of a header pipe with the release of approximately 1,270 pounds over 25 minutes.  RMP*Comp calculated the endpoint at 0.98 miles (see attached figure ACase.jp).  The population measured within this endpoint was 250 persons.\n\nWithin these perimeters, the public and environmental receptors were identified.  In support of the probability that a worst-case accidental release will not occur at the Section-Dutton WTP, a review of process hazards has been implemented and continues in order to meet the requirements of OSHA's Hazard Safety Review.   A review of the plant's operational history indicates that no reported accidental releases have occurred within the past five years at the facility.\n\nKey elements of the chlorine standard operational procedures include operator training, OSHA's Hazard Review and Preventive Maintenance protocols, Safety equipment and training, revised SOP's, and "
