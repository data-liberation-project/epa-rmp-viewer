The Waskom Rail Yard is located in a remote area and is normally occupied Monday-Friday. The Waskom Rail Yard stores and transports natural gas products from the Waskom Gas Plant. The natural gas and liquids are temporarily stored onsite.  The largest volume stored in a process is in a 34,000 gallon natural gasoline railcar. \n\n\n\nA total rupture of the 34,000 gallon natural gasoline railcar resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Waskom Rail Yard. The 34,000 gallon railcar has been evaluated for total rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.49 miles. Since there are public receptors within a 0.49 mile radius, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 3 Level RMP under 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nA process piping release of natural gasoline due to the failure of flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seals, and drains or bleeds for a ten minute duration resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the alternative case scenario for the Waskom Rail yard.

The Enable Midstream policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nEnable Midstream operates Waskom Rail Yard located in Harrison County, Texas. Waskom Rail Yard is a storage and loading facility. The facility handles LPG, which is comprised of ethane, propane, butanes, and heavier hydrocarbons, from natural gas. As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, Waskom Rail Yard is a Program 3 process.\n\n\n\nWaskom Rail Yard was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nEnable Midstream identified one regulated flammable substance (natural gasoline, flammable liquid mixture) and zero regulated toxic substances along with the largest vessel quantity stored. It was determined that a single vessel of the flammable liquid mixture exceeded threshold quantity. The identification of this exceedance indicates that Waskom Rail Yard is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSince the Waskom Rail Yard it had not had any accidental releases during the past five years which meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\n\n\nWaskom Rail Yard has c"

Operators are equipped with an Emergency Action Plan Book that provides the procedures to follow in case of an emergency.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Waskom Rail Yard. Because the facility has processes that are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the required elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nEnable Midstream and the Waskom Rail Yard actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment. This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information. Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Waskom Rail Yard maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards. This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within at the facility are assigned responsibility to maintain up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in the safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. In addition, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limited maint"

The facility also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Waskom Rail Yard has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with various processes are identified and controlled. Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Waskom Rail Yard primarily uses the HAZOP method to perform these evaluations. This technique provides a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design. Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed. The PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed. The Waskom Rail Yard assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule for completion dates. The also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original designed safety features, the facility periodical updates and revalidates the hazard analysis.

These procedures can be used as a reference by operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current. When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process. \n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written operating procedures, the Waskom Rail Yard has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive job specific basic training in process operations. Employee training includes an emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices. Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nThe Waskom Rail Yard issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process. The Waskom Rail Yard provides hot work permit training to all employees.

This review provides an additional check to make sure that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specification, that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that training of each employee involved in operating the process or equipment has been completed. A standard checklist is used to document compliance.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Waskom Rail Yard has well-established programs, procedures, and practices that are required to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle hazardous chemicals and/or flammable gas or liquid are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of a release. Equipment examples include vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, and relief and vent systems with associated emergency shutdown systems and controls (i.e. monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks).\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on 1) an overview of the process, 2) a review of process hazards, and 3) the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to ensure that the employees can perform the job tasks in a safe and satisfactory manner.
