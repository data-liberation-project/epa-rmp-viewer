CENTRAL RESOURCES, INC. maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The South Coles Levee Gas Plant has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department and Certified Unified Program Agency.  \n?    In the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, contact 9-1-1, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, and secure the area.   The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n?    Based on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release in the last 5 years.  This information was verified by the reviewing records from the Certified Unified Program Agency.\n?    The worst-case release scenario of 389,645 pounds of liquefied petroleum gasoline liquids is based on the Environmental Protection Agency model.  The scenario indicates a 1-psi overpressure distance of 0.6 miles.  This distance does not impact public receptors. \n\n?    This is a remote facility.  All visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit.  \n?    Seismic parameters were addressed by conducting a walkthrough of the facility and reviewing the mechanical integrity records.  There were no significant indications of deterioration. \n\n\nThe seismic walkthrough was conducted as a requirement of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program, 19 CCR 2735.  During the preliminary visits, it was believed that this facility would fall under a RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 due to the process safety management regulatory oversight.  However, after consideration of the remote location and discussions with the Certified Unified Program Agency, (Dale Hineman and Dan Starky, April 19, 1999), the So"
