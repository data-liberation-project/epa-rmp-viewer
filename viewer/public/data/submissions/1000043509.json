Contractors entering our property will follow applicable requirements of the City's hazard communication program.\n\n\n\n    The Tosches Creek WWTP is located off S.C. Hwy. 49 just to the west of the City of Union. This facility treats domestic and industrial wastewaters for subsequent discharge into Fairforest Creek under NPDES Permit No. SC0047244.  Treatment processes include solids screening, extended aeration with return activated sludge, clarification and disinfection.\n\n\n\n    Disinfection is accomplished by chlorination of the plant effluent just prior to discharge.  Facilities in place to accomplish this task include pumping and chlorinator equipment to provide a chlorine solution at rates proportional to discharge flow rates.  Chlorine for this process is stored and handled on-site in ton cylinders.  Normal operations include two cylinders, one cylinder in use; one on standby.  The on-line cylinders have individual vacuum regulators, and are manifolded on the vacuum side with automatic switchover to the chlorination equipment. \n\n\n\n    Chlorine is the only regulated substance maintained on-site in quantities above the regulated threshold limit.\n\n\n\n    The general accidental release prevention program is a multi-faceted effort configured to comply with both EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM rules.  Key elements include a high level of employee training, an aggressive equipment maintenance routine, detailed operation procedures, hazard reviews and management controls.\n\n\n\n    Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detection equipment.\n\n\n\n    No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n    The facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the City of Union Fire Department.
