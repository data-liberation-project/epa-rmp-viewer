If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and transferred for use as a crop production nutrient.  We have three bulk tanks at this facility:  1-26,000 gallon (113,594#) and 2 - 11,000 gallon tanks (combined @ 96,119#).  There are also 11-1,000 gallon nurse tanks on site that hold a combined 48,059# @ 85% full as allowed by law.  The total on site capacity would be 257,771.\n\nThe worst case release scenario and alternate scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due, in part, to the Homeland Security Act.  All relevant information will be forwarded to the local responders and the LEPC. \n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61/1\" and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture inspects our plants on an annual basis.  We also meet the current underwriting guidelines of our Insurance and undergo annual loss control surveys based on both physical property and safety/operational procedures.  NOTE:  The state of Kansas has not yet adopted the most recent ANSI standards. Our company realizes the importance of keeping current with the standard and we will do our best to budget time and money as needed to bring all facilities into full compliance.\n\nOur firm has an outstanding safety record at this location.  In the past five years we have had no reportable accidents nor to our knowledge have we had any off-site deaths, injuries, sheltering in place, evacuations or enviro"

We rotate our employees on a three-year basis and send them to NH3 schools that we feel provide excellent training.  Employees are trained on the hazards of the chemical they are using and the possible consequences of a release.  We have implemented Standard Operating Procedures that are written down for the benefit of our new employees, as well as Standard Maintenance Procedures.  \n\nOur firm has a detailed emergency action plan, which OSHA requires. As required by 29CFR1910.120(P)(8) the Emergency Response Plan is not needed.  Our employees are trained to evacuate the area should an emergency release occur.  Employees are trained on basic first aid for victims, where to evacuate too, and how to notify first responders.   \n\nWe report to the county, state and local fire department chemical inventories and locations as required by The Community Right-to-Know\" rules and regulations.  \n\nSafety improvements are an ongoing process at our firm.  We are dedicated to safely serving our customers and protecting the employees that work for us.  Training, equipment and maintenance are of the highest quality and design.  We order all parts from an industry specialist to insure that they are approved parts for the process.  At this time there are no specific upgrades planned.  We are proud of our efforts and proud to serve the communities in which we operate.\n\nThere are currently improvements being planned including emergency shut off valves."
