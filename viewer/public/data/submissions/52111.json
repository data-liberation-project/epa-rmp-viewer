Markets Refrigerated DC facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) has been developed by Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC and is included as Appendix B in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document which is maintained at the facility.\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Stater Bros.

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nThe Stater Bros.

      "SummaryText": "emergency responders (fire department hazardous materials division). The Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe system at 301 South Tippecanoe in San Bernardino, California was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  The facility was constructed in 2007/2008.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 80,000 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs.\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the"

In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated Distribution Center facility is under construction and will be completed in late summer in the year 2008 and thus there is no accident history to report.  [CCR Title 8, \u00a7 5189(e)(2)(G)]\n\n PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis (performed in two phases: September 28, 2007 & April 8, 2008), including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC facility located at 301 South Tippecanoe in San Bernardino, California. The Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
