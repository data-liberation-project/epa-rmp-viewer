As part of the community, we have a responsibility to our customers and to those who live in the surrounding area. Through safety, concern for the environment and community involvement, we can develop a true partnership with our customers and neighbors.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THIS RMP\nAir Liquide America has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the stationary ammonia refrigeration system located at its facility at 1502 W. Anaheim St in Wilmington, California.  The RMP was developed to comply with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention regulations at 40 CFR part 68 and Program 3 requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (Cal-ARP) Program pursuant to Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (19CCR), Section 2735.6.  The Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of RMP elements.  This position has direct supervisory responsibility for the operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Key technical groups within Air Liquide support the development of some prevention program elements. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe ALAC plant is located at 1502 West Anaheim Street in Wilmington, California, on the Phillips Petroleum (PPCO) Los Angeles Refinery (LAR).  The plant size is 1.46 acres.  The site is bordered by residential use immediately to the east, a recreational park immediately to the north and by industrial use immediately south and west. An ammonia refrigeration system provides closed loop cooling for the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) liquefaction process.  The ammonia refrigerant operates as a standard vapor refrigeration closed loop cycle.

The ammonia system is physically located outdoors.  The Ammonia is a regulated substance at the Wilmington CO2 plant. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Wilmington CO2 plant.  Because processes at the CO2 plant are regulated by EPA RMP regulations are also subject to OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nManagement alone cannot insure safety or protection of the environment. There should be no doubt that each employee must also demonstrate their concern and acknowledge their responsibility in these areas.  At the Wilmington CO2 plant, employees are encouraged to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Specific ways an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation Plan at the CO2 plant.  This plan includes the participation of employees in process hazard analysis (PHA), pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR), and being involved in incident investigations surrounding the plant.   Plant employees are trained on the plant Process Safety Information, to include at least the following: (1) information pertaining to the hazards of the hazardous chemicals in the process; (2) information pertaining to the technology of the process; and (3) information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  Plant employees are involved in the review of PSM/RMP covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are correct and recommend any necessary changes.

The employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety and employee safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAir Liquide America Corporation and the Wilmington CO2 plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters.  The plant manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process information.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provide in material safety data sheets (MSDSs) or in the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), Ammonia Data Book located in the plant managers office.  Information on the compatibility and reactivity of ammonia and additional hazards to be considered are also summarized in the IIAR data book.  While ammonia does react with some chemicals, these are not typically found in or around the CO2 plant or in the process.  The plant operating procedures and design data books provide information on the key operating limits for the process.  Plant operators are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these operating limits.  \nAlong with operating procedures to provide safe start-up, shutdown and emergency shutdown, the plant has extensive documentation on the design and construction of the plant components.

Within this program a PHA shall be completed for each new and/or major modified facility or process prior to the initial startup or re-start.  This action will help define and correct process safety deficiencies in a proposed design for a new project or changes to existing facilities.\nThe Wilmington CO2 plant has used the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) as the primary method of hazard analysis.   The first HAZOP was conducted during 1994, validated in 1997 and the most recent revalidation was conducted in March of 2000 with the completed report issued September 2000.  HAZOP is the line-by line method, described in the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)\u00bfs Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures.   This method involves systematic evaluation of the process system by examining the causes and consequences of deviations from intended conditions.  The scope of the PSM covered HAZOP includes the receipt of bulk anhydrous ammonia (offloading ammonia in the ammonia accumulator) and the use of ammonia as a refrigerant in the process.\nThe PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the process and also represents a cross section of the employees working in the process.  The PHA team includes, but is not limited to, at least one person with specific experience in the subject process, one person knowledgeable in the PHA methodology being used and one person with expertise in engineering.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\nLocal and corporate management reviews"

In addition to the hands on work, classroom instruction is conducted on process safety information, standard operating procedures, safety consideration and the Emergency Response Plan.  Newly assigned operators must pass the operator training program within the first 90 days.  After an operator has demonstrated adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition operators are required to attend annual refresher course training that includes a review of standard operating procedures, MSDS, safe handling procedures and incident/accident procedures.  Training is documented and tracked in a training matrix for each operator.  Means are used to verify that the operator understands the training.\n\nContractors\nThe Wilmington CO2 plant uses contractors to supplement its own work force when maintenance activities exceed the capabilities or time available for their own operators.  Contractors are made aware of the potential dangers involved with a system covered by Process Safety Management (PSM).  Procedures are in place to make sure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) area aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform the CO2 plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

These procedures along with others maintained by Air Liquide America\u00bfs Corporate and Area Health, Safety and Environmental department, along with training of affected personnel and periodic audits, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nAir Liquide America has establishes the requirements for ensuring that proposed process or equipment changes or changes indirectly affecting processes are evaluated, approved and documented prior to implementation through the use of a management of change (MOC) procedure.  This procedure outlines the requirements for documenting, evaluating the impact and approving planned deviations from procedure.  The Air Liquide America MOC system is a systematic process designed to help prevent inadvertent, unintended or unauthorized changes that may cause unsafe conditions, product quality problems, process hazards, unplanned outages, etc.  This standard also helps to ensure that changes are technically sound and that Qua"

The purpose of incident investigation and reporting is to identify root causes and correct them rather than simply addressing the symptom of the incident.  Incident investigation and reporting is one of the primary methods used to continuously improve our operations by sharing information, root causes and corrective actions to prevent recurrence.  Incidents such as unusual or unexpected event including personnel injury (OSHA recordable), equipment damage, equipment or material failure, excursions outside specified operating ranges, interruptions in process operations, interlock activation, interlock failure or the production of product of an unacceptable quality are promptly investigated.  The plant manager is responsible for maintaining a log and track incidents and corrective actions through completion.   Results of findings and corrective actions are shared with employees who could be affected by the findings.  Reports are retained for at least 5 years to be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help insure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Wilmington CO2 plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  A team knowledgeable about the facility must conduct the audit, but the majority of the team must not be involved in the day-to-day operations of the ammonia.  Recommendations and findings from the Audit team are resolved in a timely manner.  The plant manager is responsible for obtaining engineering"

Once the resolutions have been completed, communication of the changes are made to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at the Wilmington CO2 plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered ammonia system in the plant.  These prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\nIn addition to the accident prevention program, the CO2 plant has safety features designed to (1) quickly detect the release, (2) contain/control the release; (3) reduce the consequence of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\nRelease Detection\n- Ammonia detectors set to trip at 50 ppm located along the east fence line of the refinery.\n- Handheld monitor for use in local leak detection\nRelease Containment/Control\n- All ammonia safety valves release ammonia to a 15,000 gallon water tank rather than to the atmosphere.\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process. (Manual)\n- Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release.  \n- Containment dike for the ammonia accumulator to contain any liquid ammonia leaks.\nRelease Mitigation\n- Water deluge system over the ammonia accumulator to serve to \u00bfknock down\u00bf of ammonia vapor in the event of a release to reduce off-site exposure. \n- Two firewater monitors capable of cooling the ammonia storage tank and knocking down the ammonia vapor from a leak.\n- Coordination with refinery trained emergency response personnel in event of an accidental release.  \n- Personal protective equipment (e.g., protect"

Mitigation and containment devices recently installed have helped to prevent or reduce the effects of potential accidents.  The last accident resulting in any offsite or onsite effects occurred in 1993.  All incidents are investigated very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe Wilmington CO2 plant employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substance and will only maintain a written emergency action plan.  This emergency action plan consists of procedures for notifying emergency responders when there is a need to respond to a release of a regulated substance.  The document describes coordination with local response agencies, outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release and provides detailed evacuation procedures.  The Wilmington CO2 plant is located within the Philips Petroleum Co Los Angeles Refinery and in cooperation with the refinery have jointly reviewed the action plan to insure appropriate action can be taken in the event of an accidental release.   The Refinery Emergency Responders will perform emergency response for Air Liquide in the event of an accidental release.\nIf an emergency involving the release of ammonia occurs that will have off-site consequences, the Unified Command, which includes PPCO Incident Commander, ALAC Coordinator, LAFD and LAPD Incident Commanders, shall coordinate evacuation of the affected community.  The Wilmington CO2 plant will maintain regular communication with the local LAFD to ensure LAFD is aware of the on-site AHM and to insure they are familiar with the Wilmington CO2 Plant Emergency Response Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Wilmington CO2 plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications of the proc"
