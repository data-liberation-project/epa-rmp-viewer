      "SummaryText": "HUNTSMAN MARYSVILLE - EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY\n \n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  \nHuntsman Marysville is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Marysville Site's 15-1/2 year \"0\" accidental release history.   The Huntsman Marysville site maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Marysville participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since first producing quality polypropylene resin for automotive and other industries in October 1988, the Marysville Site has remained both a safe and quality supplier for over 15 years in Eastern Michigan as exemplified by our June 1996 certification to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management process, a September 1998 Automotive Industry's QS-9000 quality management system certification, and most recently, a successful State Process Safety Management inspection during January 2003 which resulted in compliments to the site for operating a comprehensive program.\n\nHuntsman's Marysville site is located in the southwestern corner of the City of Marysville, Michigan.  The site includes 58.6 acres, of which 20 acres have been developed.  The Marysville Site utilizes a continuous polymerization operation to convert pipeline-supplied propylene and ethylene into polypropylene pellets which molding companies then process into useful applications such as:  automotive trim, toys, medical containers, appliance parts, and other consumer products.  Propane is produced as a by-product of propylene purification.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances.\nHuntsman's Marysville Site has 2 regulated substanc"

Offsite Consequence Analysis.\nThe RMP Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA section of this Risk Management Plan includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  \n\nHuntsman Marysville used LandView 5, software supplied by the USEPA et al., to estimate the residential population within the distance to endpoint for both the Worst Case Release and Alternative Case Release Scenarios.  Huntsman Marysville also used knowledge of the surrounding area in estimating affected populations. \n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. \nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Marysville Site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.  \n\n\u00bf Process Safety Information\n Huntsman's Marysville Site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n\n\u00bf Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\n\u00bf The technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature a"

The Marysville Site utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating process hazards.  The Marysville Site assigns employees to the PHA team who are knowledgeable in the PHA methodology and the specific process.  The PHA team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.\n \n\u00bf Operating Procedures\n Huntsman Marysville maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures, and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \n\u00bf Training\n Huntsman Marysville provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n \n\u00bf Mechanical Integrity\n Huntsman Marysville has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity p"

The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change; its impact on safety and health; associated modifications required of operating procedures; the necessary time period for the change; and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.  \n  \n\u00bf Pre-Startup Review\n Huntsman Marysville performs pre-startup safety reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup safety review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; management-of-change requirements are met; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n \n\u00bf Compliance Audit\n Huntsman Marysville performs audits to ensure its compliance with the provisions of its process safety management program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.

The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman Marysville has available an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  Huntsman Marysville has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution.  Finally, incident reports are reviewed with all affected personnel.\n \n\u00bf Employee Participation\n Huntsman Marysville has developed a written action plan for employee participation in all aspects of its process safety management program.  Huntsman Marysville consults with employees on the conduct and development of PHA's and on the development of other elements of the process safety management program.  Huntsman Marysville ensures that all employees have access to PHA's and all other process safety management information.\n \n\u00bf Hot Work Permit\n Huntsman Marysville employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing operations).  If any hot work is performed near the covered process, Huntsman Marysville issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.
