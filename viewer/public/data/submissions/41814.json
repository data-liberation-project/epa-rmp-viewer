Our accidental release policy involves a unified approach that intergrates technology, procedures and management practices.  The Emergency Response Policy involves preparation of plans tailored to our facility and the emergency response services available in the community and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\nThe W.A. Oeffler-Norwood Water Treatment Plant is located in the Norland area of North West Dade County, a largely residential area, with three schools in close proximity.  The chlorination facility is located in the North West corner of the property.  This fascility normally contains six to eight ton cylinders of liquid chlorine, five wall mounted chlorinators, two sets of scales with dials, two inline chlorine leak detectors, and leak repair safety equipment.  Directly outside the facility is two independent breathing apparatus.  The operators visit the site daily during normal hourly plant inspections.\nOur general accidental release program is based on some of the following key elements:\n\n1.  Continuous high level training of the Operators\n2.  Preventive maintenance program\n3.  Use of state of the art process safety equipment\n4.  Effective operation and handling procedures, written with the participation of the Operators\n5.  Continuous evaluation of the safety equipment and procedures\n6.  Chemical specific training on the self contained breathing apparatus(SCBA) which canbe worn during connections of cylinders\n7.  Yearly MSDS awareness reevaluation of hazardous properties of toxic materials\n\nThe W.A. Oeffler-Norwood Water Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past five years.\nThe facility has an emergency response program which has been coordinated and reviewed by the Local Emergency Response Planning Committie.  This program includes a decision tree and notification plan.  Yearly upda"
