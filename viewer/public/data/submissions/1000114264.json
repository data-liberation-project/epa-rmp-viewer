Five-year Accident History\r\nThe Oshkosh WWTP went on-line in December 1975. Since going on-line, no documented accidental releases have occurred.   \r\n5. Emergency Response Plan\r\nEmergency response by WWTP employees is limited to minor, incidental releases only. The plant has coordinated emergency response actions with the City of Oshkosh Fire Department and the City of Oshkosh emergency dispatcher. The Oshkosh Wastewater Treatment Plant Emergency Response Plan is review annually and updated as needed.\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe City of Oshkosh uses a continual improvement process to improve safety and minimize risks of chlorine release. The process includes periodic review of the RMP, operating procedures, training content and the process hazards review. Modifications to these materials are documented as appropriate."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe City of Oshkosh Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) uses gaseous chlorine for disinfection of the treated wastewater prior to discharge. Chlorine is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The City of Oshkosh is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is important to an accidental release prevention program that includes areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorine storage and feed processes at the WWTP. It is City policy to comply with applicable Federal and state rules and regulations including completion of comprehensive updates to its Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program every five years, or as needed to reflect changes to the WWTP chlorine process.\r\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOne regulated substance, gaseous chlorine, is used at the Oshkosh WWTP to disinfect treated wastewater. Chlorine is a toxic gas stored under pressure in both liquid and gas phase. The maximum WWTP inventory of chlorine at is nine (9) - 2,000 pound (1-ton) containers, for a total of 18,000 pounds.  \r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe Oshkosh WWTP has taken the necessary steps to comply with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule requirements as specified in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68). The Plant is also in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Rule as specified in 29 CFR 1910.119. The chlorine ton containers are handled minimally outside of the facility and are stored indoors. A vacuum chlorine gas feed system automatically stops the flow of chlorine in the event of vacuum piping or valve failure. Wastewater Treatmen"
