      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nValero Renewable Fuels, LLC - Fort Dodge (Valero Renewables) is committed to the protection of our employees, the public and the environment. This is demonstrated through our prevention program which covers areas such as operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with regulated substances. Valero Renewables carries a written emergency response plan to assist with accidental releases of hazardous materials. This plan includes all aspects of emergency response including evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident procedures.\n\nProcesses and Regulated Substances\n\nValero Renewables operates an ethanol fuel production plant located in Fort Doge, Iowa. The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and processes by-products known as dry and wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance. The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 1,232,385 pounds (total pentane is 492,954 pounds). The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control. The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 92,351 pounds.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken necessary steps to meet EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 as well as Process Safety Management requirement under OSHA. Written procedures are in place at Valero Renewables to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process Operators, Maintenance personnel, or any other employee"

Our facilities Mechanical Integrity programs details maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nValero Renewable Fuels, LLC has had one accident in the last five years.  On April 30, 2009, a release of approximately 29 pounds of anhydrous ammonia occurred which resulted in one employee receiving medical treatment beyond first aid.  The release occurred during the offloading operations of an ammonia delivery truck.  A vent hose which is used to drain the transfer hose was submerged in a container of water.  The vent hose came loose and released anhydrous ammonia.  An employee in the area was sprayed on his lower leg with ammonia.  No burns were sustained.  The employee felt nauseas and was taken to the clinic were breathing treatments were administered.  The release was reported to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.  No emergency response was required.  No property damage or environmental damage occurred from the release.  A thorough investigation was conducted including a TapRoot root cause analysis.  Corrective actions included a change to the design of the container used for bleeding off transfer hoses, a more thorough checklist for preparation and performing anhydrous ammonia offloading, restriction of employees from the area during the offloading and bleeding process, and detailed training for all operators on the anhydrous ammonia system and offloading procedure.\n\nCommitment to Improved Safety\nThe Valero Renewable"
