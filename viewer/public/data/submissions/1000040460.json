The properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it.  It is the policy of the Cooperative and its employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community.  Safety depends upon the competent training of our personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\r\n\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled:\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute anhydrous ammonia to our customers as a nitrogen source, with its primary use as a crop land fertilizer. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck (transports) and is stored in two (2) storage tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is distributed from this facility by nurse tanks.  The facility has the necessary equipment to safely load and unload transports, and nurse tanks.  Access to the tank controls and hoses are restricted to authorized employees and management personnel, along with authorized contractors that may work on the facility.  \r\n\r\nThe only regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount stored at the site is 62,050 gallons or 331,968 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations.  The facility design and construction is in accordance with the ANSI K 61.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards.  It is formally inspected a minimum of once a year for compliance to all ap"
