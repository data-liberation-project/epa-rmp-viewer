In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 424510, \"Grain and Field Bean Merchant Wholesalers\", however, we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include receiving, storage and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for this activity is NAICS code \"424910, Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers\".  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Planning at this time.\n\nAt the Gothenburg NE facility, Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and consumed in a process to convert phosphoric acid into liquid fertilizer, 10-34-0 during the early spring and fall months.  The conversion is done by a 3rd party who brings a converter on-site.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the offloading of a semi-trailer transport vehicle.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving of product into storage.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore, item number 1.11 is zero.  Our facilities have adequate lighting and are inspected at various"

This information has been provided to the county LEPC to assist them in their planning.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\n\n\nThere has not been a release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at this site.

This information has been provided to the county LEPC to assist them in their planning.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release program:\n\n\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc.

We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to; excess flow valves, breakaway couplers at risers, emergency shut-off valves and barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles.  Additionally, locks are used to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  We also maintain routine contact with local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nWe have developed an Emergency Action Plan for employees, customers and visitor protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and other acts of god that require evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our co"
