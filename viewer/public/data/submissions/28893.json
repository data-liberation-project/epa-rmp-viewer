The Tanner family started out in the ammonia business in 1955 with the purchase of National Ammonia Company in Philadelphia, PA. The company has grown to it's current size through the acquisition of three other ammonia companies, Bower Ammonia and Chemical Co. in 1971, Northeastern Ammonia Co. in 1985, and Hamler Industries in 1991. This particular facility was established in 2003.\n\nThe mission of Tanner Industries, Inc. is to constantly improve our products and services to meet or exceed our customers needs, to distribute our products in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner, and to generate a reasonable return in order to provide continuity for the business and employment for our employees. \n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as it applies to the safe distribution of ammonia. Our commitment to the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP) provides our company with an integrated health and safety, environmental, and product stewardship program that is supported by our strong corporate capabilities. Our dedication to the proper distribution and stewardship of ammonia includes involvement in emergency response training for first responders and other industry personnel to enhance"

      "SummaryText": " the protection of our employees and community neighbors. \n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is a distributor of anhydrous ammonia. We are not a manufacturer. The material is transported to our facility by rail car and then transferred from the rail car to our transport cargo tanks for bulk distribution to the end-users of the material.\n\nThe potential maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored at this facility on any particular day is 316,000 pounds. It is only on rare occasions when these potential storage quantities are actually achieved. Each storage vessel is limited by federal regulation to 85% of the maximum volume of the storage vessel. The maximum quantity handled at any particular time would occur during the transfer from a railcar to a transport cargo tank and that quantity is 34,365 pounds.\n\nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\n\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses. The largest users of ammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a fertilizer. Some agricultural businesses combine ammonia and other chemicals and nutrients to form more complex fertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles, pharmaceuticals, cleaning solutions, dyes, inks and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used by some companies in various processes. Ammonia is recognized as an \"ozone safe\" refrigerant. This means that, unlike other refrigerants, any ammonia releases into the atmosphere will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Besides refrigeration, Ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, reprographics, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\n\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\n\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages.  Accompanied with a very pungent odor, ammonia can be said to be \"auto-repulsive\". These  character"

High concentrations could have more serious health effects. These could include convulsive coughing, difficult and painful breathing, eye damage and in extreme cases, death. Liquid ammonia or ammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce serious chemical burns requiring prompt medical attention.\n\nEmployees and contractors who work around ammonia should take the extra precautions of reviewing Material Safety Data Sheets, wearing appropriate safety equipment and participating in special training programs as prescribed by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nSafety Improvement Process:\n\nSafety improvement is a corporate wide philosophy.  Tanner Industries, Inc. continuously searches for ways to improve safety performance. Each facility has an individual safety committee comprised of site employees and management. These committees meet on a periodic basis to review safety concerns at our sites as well as at our customer facilities. The management representatives of the site specific committee report directly to the corporate safety committee. The corporate safety committee is comprised of upper management, compliance personnel and headquarters employees that are familiar with plant processes. This committee meets on a regular basis to review accident and injury investigations, evaluate site specific issues, provide recommendations and implementation guidance.  Also, qualified personnel periodically inspect and evaluate each facility to assess safety and maintenance conditions. The results of these facility inspections are reported directly to upper management and the operations department. As a whole, these systems provide Tanner Industries, Inc. with a continuous process for the identification of safety improvement opportunities thus reducing any risk to our society associated with a release of this important ch"

Off-site receptors have been identified using \"LandView V\" software developed by the US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario\nTanner Industries, Inc considered a 160,000 pound release of anhydrous ammonia as the worst case scenario. The release event resulted from the entire contents of the largest vessel, in this case a railcar, emptying in 10 minutes. Since ammonia is stored as a liquid under pressure, the release would result in a dual-phase flow. Dual-phase flow means that the material would simultaneously flow as a gas and a liquid and then vaporize into a gas. The dual-phase flow was automatically considered by the software for this scenario. Liquid ammonia spills also undergo a phenomenon known as \"auto-refrigeration\". This is an effect that is demonstrated by a decrease in the internal temperature of an ammonia pool due to vaporization. This characteristic essentially dec"

In December 2002, David Binder, Director of Quality, Safety & Regulatory Affairs at Tanner was presented EPA Region III's Partnership Award in recognition of significant efforts towards emergency preparedness, prevention and response programs.\n\nTanner Industries, Inc. uses a variety of safety equipment and specialized procedures to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. In support of our policy, the following is a typical list of safety equipment and systems employed at this facility. \n\n   a) Pressure relief valves are employed on all storage, transfer and delivery equipment to handle unexpected increases in pressure. Per their operational design, these valves will reset after relieving only the excess pressure. Depending on their situational placement in the process, these valves may be designed to relieve pressures caused from either vapor or liquid.\n\n   b) Excess flow shut off devices are incorporated through out the process as prescribed by federal regulation. These valves are designed to stop the flow of liquid material any time their rated flow capacity is exceeded. These valves are designed to prevent the catastrophic release attributed to a storage tank line or valve break.\n\n   c) Breakaway valves are installed at the unloading platforms.  These valves are designed to separate and stop the flow of liquid material, minimizing damage to piping and other equipment.\n\n   d) Regular facility and equipment inspections ensure safe and proper operating conditions.\n\n   e) Employees are trained in start-up, operation, shut-down and maintenance of all equipment.

An increased effect could be expected if the release were to occur within an area that limited the exposed surface of the pool. Neither the  auto-refrigeration property of ammonia or any other mitigating factors were a consideration used in this scenario. \n\nThe off-site area impacted by the release could experience ammonia concentrations of 200 parts per million (ppm). Please refer Section 2, Worst Case Release Scenario of the Risk Management Plan for further information.\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario\nTanner Industries, Inc considered a conservative alternate case scenario. We selected a release resulting from the rupture of a liquid loading hose.  The scenario was performed considering the total 14.5 pounds of ammonia released as a liquid, similar to the worst case scenario. The only mitigating factor considered is our usage of Smart-Hose technology, which limits the loss of anhydrous ammonia to the contents of the hose.. \n\nThe off-site area impacted by the release could experience ammonia concentrations of 200 parts per million (ppm).
