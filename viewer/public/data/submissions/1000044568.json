It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local\n\nrules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, the\n\nsafety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use\n\nand the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with ANSI K-61.1 and OSHA 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia\n\nstorage.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency\n\nresponse agency.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage.  We receive anhydrous ammonia by rail and transport\n\ntruck and store it as a liquid in pressurized vessels.  Access to the process is restricted to\n\nauthorized employees and contractors.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be\n\nstored at this facility is 60,000 gallons (water capacity).\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario:\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is failure of a 12 foot length of 3 inch hose due to a cracked\n\nhose or failed fitting.  The operator observes the leak and isolates the hose by closing the\n\nshut-off valves.  The contents of the hose are released over a period of ten minutes (23 lbs \n\ntotal).  The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 317 feet, based on the dense gas dispersion \n\nmodel Degadis.  This distance extends slightly beyond the facility boundary and there is one\n\nreceptor within the distance to endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and ch"

These activities are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWe maintain written operating procedures for operation of the anhydrous ammonia storage\n\nfacility.  These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup,\n\nnormal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal\n\nshutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is readily accessible to operators.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating\n\nprocesses are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher\n\ntraining is provided at least every three years.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nOur EHSS team performs thorough annual maintenance inspections of process equipment to ensure\n\nproper operations.  Basic visual inspections are performed by facility operators on a more\n\nfrequent basis during loading and unloading of anhydrous ammonia delivery vehicles.
