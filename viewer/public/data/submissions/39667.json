Accidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this Western Farm Service facility are committed to the prevention of any release of chemicals handled at the facility.  If a release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with the local hazardous material team, the local fire department, the local administering agency and our emergency response contractorto control, contain and clean up the release.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage and sale of liquid and dry fertilizers and pre-packaged and bulk agricultural chemical to growers and ranchers.\n\nThis facility stores and handles two regulated chemicals - Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used for direct field application by growers as a fertilizer.\n\nAqua Ammonia is a component of a liquid fertilizer that is stored at the facility.  The liquid fertilizer containing Aqua Ammonia is used by growers in direct field applications.\n\n3. Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThis facility prepared a worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  These are not included as recommended by EPA.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility operates in accordance with the following regulations:\n\n-- National Electrical Code\n-- Uniform Fire Code\n-- Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, ANSI K 61.1, 1989, American National Standard Institute, Inc.\n-- Title 8, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\n-- Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\n-- Title 29, CFR 1920.38, Employee Emergency Response Plan and Fire Prevention Plans\n-- Title 29, CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\n\n5.
