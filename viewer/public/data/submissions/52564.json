The refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe facility?s two systems use a total of 31,733 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for warehousing and distribution of food and related products and services. The Processing System uses 24,673 pounds of ammonia, while the Cold Storage System uses 7,060 pounds.  The vessels and compressors are located inside and outside the engine rooms. The condensers are mounted on the roof and all of the evaporators are located in their respective freezer/cold storage areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Twin City Foods ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, Twin City Foods operates in accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration systems include: ammonia sensors that sound a facility-wide al"
