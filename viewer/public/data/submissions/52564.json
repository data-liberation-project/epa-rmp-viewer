Twin City Foods administers safety and environmental policies at the facility to ensure compliance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP). These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, and the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nTwin City Foods is located at 1315 Sherman Street in Lake Odessa, Michigan. The refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe facility\u00bfs two systems use a total of 31,733 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for warehousing and distribution of food and related products and services. The Processing System uses 24,673 pounds of ammonia, while the Cold Storage System uses 7,060 pounds.  The vessels and compressors are located inside and outside the engine rooms. The condensers are mounted on the roof and all of the evaporators are located in their respective freezer/cold storage areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Twin City Foods ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, Twin City Foods operates in accordance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration systems include: ammonia sensors that sound a facility-wide al"

In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\u00bf is used at the facility.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Twin City Foods facility\u00bfs accident history revealed that there have been no reportable ammonia releases over the past five years (August 2003 \u00bf August 2008).\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nTwin City Foods has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility. The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n 1.) To save lives.\n 2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n 3.) To protect the environment.\n 4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nTwin City Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) performed in April 10, 2007, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Twin City Foods facility located at 1541 W. 27th Street"
