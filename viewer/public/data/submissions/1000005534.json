This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release where to occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of oil-field chemicals. We have eight regulated substances present at our facility that are over the threshold amount. Toxic substances include Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqueous Ammonia, Ethylene Oxide, Formaldehyde 37% solution, Propylene Oxide, and Ethylenediamine. Flammable substances include Isopentane, and Isopropylamine.\n\nThe regulated substances are used in various processes at the facility.  Ammonia and isopropylamine are used in acid neutralization reactions. Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide are used in alkyloxylation reactions. Formaldehyde solution is used in the production of resins. Isopentane are used in the production of a pipeline drag reducing agent.  Ethylenediamine is used for resin blends.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. A number of processes at our facility are subject to OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the HAZOP method. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, plant operations, and maintenance. Employees get to make suggestions to improve the safety and environmental operation of their work environment. The analyses are reviewed and revalidated at least every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, BPC-Sand Springs maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address normal operations, including startup, shutdown, and emergency operations. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nBPC-Sand Springs is an ISO 9001 certified facility. This requires the facility to keep up-to-date procedures on all of our operating procedures. There are regular audits from both internal and external auditors.\n\nTRAINING - BPC-Sand Springs has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Also, in excess of 150 hours per year are spent in operational, safety, and environmental training by every plant employee. This includes offsite fire training where simulations are real and the employee must learn to react quickly to protect himself, his fellow employee, and property from harm. In addition, BPC-Sand Springs has supported and sponsored training for members "
