The Process Safety Management Program is in fulfillment of the Occupational Health and Safety Administration\u00bfs (OSHA) 1910.119, as well as Cal/OSHA\u00bfs California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials. \nAs with the use of any hazardous chemicals, the use of chlorine in this treatment process poses the potential for an accidental release that could have offsite consequences.  It is for this reason that several years ago, under the provisions of the recently promulgated Risk Management Program Rule (40 CFR 68), the Alvarado Water Treatment Plant conducted an assessment of offsite consequences of accident scenarios involving the uncontrolled release of chlorine to the surrounding environment.  Under the provisions of the rule, the treatment process used at the Alvarado Water Treatment Plant is considered a Program 3 process, and as such conducted an analysis of: (1) a worst case release scenario and (2) one or more alternative release scenarios. The analysis of offsite consequences produced information incorporated into the Risk Management Plan (RMP) which covers population and environmental receptors in the environs within the affected areas.\n\nSafety Elements:\nSafety elements can be defined as either administrative or engineering controls.  Administrative elements include; 1) procedural requirements, 2) training, 3) operator certification, and 4) City\u00bfs policy and commitment of resources.  Engineering elements include physical modifications or facilities to 1) detect, 2) contain, 3) treat, 4) warn, or 5) eliminate a potential incident. Several technological (design/construction) upgrades were made to enhance our emergency response capabilities if a chlorine leak were to occur. They consist of: \n\n1) Chlorine leak detection sensors"

A critical component of this system is the \u00bfscrubber\u00bf, which is capable, in the event of a release, of neutralizing 2000 pounds of chlorine. This \u00bfscrubber\u00bf is activated by data acquired by the leak sensors, and may be initiated manually by Plant staff; \n\n5) Several safe-work-practices for the operations and maintenance sections have been developed in conjunction with other safety programs to ensure employees work and respond safely.\nThe Alvarado Water Treatment Plant, in conjunction in with the Water Department Emergency Management Coordinator, have developed and tested a Chlorine Emergency Response Plan. The Emergency Response Plan was developed to support the Water Plant Operator in the event a chlorine release occurs and additional resources are needed to mitigate the situation. The San Diego Fire Department, Hazardous Materials Incident Response Team is dedicated to respond to our water plants if we have an incident. The Alvarado Water Treatment Plant has a Business Plan that identifies evacuation points on the site and provides additional emergency information about chlorine and additional contacts if needed. The Alvarado Water Treatment Plant has had no significant accidental releases of chlorine within the last five years requiring plant evacuation or requiring off site evacuation or consequences.\n\nThe Alvarado Water Tr"

Likely, the most significant improvement has been the new Chlorine Facility with chlorine detection, containment, and scrubbing capabilities that was completed in 2003. Additionally, upgraded security systems will be added to all access points to allow the duty operator to monitor the complete facility with ease.\n\nAccident History:\nThe City has maintained a clean record of accidental releases of acutely hazardous materials and reports no incidents.  The City does maintain a comprehensive Incident Investigation and Emergency Response Programs in the event of an occurrence.  Ongoing \nEmergency Response training provides the personnel and resources familiarity with procedures and available resources.  \n\nCompliance Audit:\nA compliance audit was conducted in accordance with RMP/PSM requirements by an outside consultant in 2003. The audit was to evaluate the adequacy of the PSM and RMP programs and provide recommendations of improvements. The Safety Committee is reviewing the situation and a plan of action is pending."

The City developed and implemented the City\u00bfs Process Safety Management/ Risk Management Prevention Program that provides a systematic approach to employee involvement, safety awareness and program assessment.\n\nPlant Description:\nThe Alvarado Water Treatment Plant was built in the early 1950's and became an architecture center piece of the community due to its beauty and mission style design. The Alvarado Water Treatment Plant has a maximum water treatment capacity of 150- million gallons per day (mgd), with a current capital improvement project goal of expanding treated water capacity to 200 mgd. The facility is located on a mesa on relatively flat terrain bounded by the Lake Murray Reservoir to the north, and by residential areas in other directions bordering the City of La Mesa.  There is elevated terrain across the reservoir, and downward-sloping terrain to the south.\nAlvarado Water Treatment Plant uses a combined form of chlorine to disinfect water, making it suitable for use in the City of San Diego's drinking water distribution system and for sale to other agencies. The chlorine is received in one-ton pressurized liquid cylinders at the Chlorine Storage Room in the Raw Water Chemical Building.\n\nCommitment:\nThe Alvarado Water Treatment Plant has a well trained and committed operations and maintenance staff with a record of over 50 years of using chlorine safely.  To support the efforts of continued safe handling and use of chlorine at the Alvarado Water Treatment Plant, senior management has committed to the development of a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program under the guidelines of State and Federal mandates which has involved complete engineering reviews of the chlorine feed system and design certification.\n\nProgram Complianc"
