These programs include both Union Carbides Responsible Care. requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n2    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Union Carbide South Charleston Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 500 different specialty chemicals and plastics in its various operating units.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as theSouth Charleston Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements.  Union Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at the South Charleston Plant:\n\nAllyl Alcohol    \nEthylene Oxide      \nPropylene Oxide\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\nCrotonaldehyde\n50% Formaldehyde\n\nUnion Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated flammable substances at the South Charleston Plant:\n\nVinyl Methyl Ether\nDimethylamine\nMethylamine\nAcetaldehyde\nVinyl Ethyl Ether\n3    Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenar"

The plant's general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\n\nA)  Regulated Toxic Substances\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThis scenario assumes an over-pressure and rupture of a storage tank, releasing 39,000 lbs. of allyl alcohol as a gas to the atmosphere. According to EPAs Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\n\nSpecific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Hose Hook-up Design:  Transfer hose connections are designed to prevent connection to an incompatible material, which might cause an uncontrolled reaction in the tank.\n7 Material Analysis:  A certificate of analysis must be reviewed to confirm transfer of material to the allyl alcohol storage tank is allyl alcohol and not an incompatible material.\n7 Fire Water Spray Monitors:  Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress allyl alcohol vapors.\n7 Surveillance: Operators routinely monitor the process.\n\nAlternate-Case Release Scenario(s)\n\nAllyl Alcohol:  This scenario assumes an uncontrolled reaction causes a process vessel to fail and release allyl alcohol as vapor to the atmosphere at a rate of 2300 lbs. per minute for 15 minutes.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\nThe following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n7 Emergency Shutdown System:  The system is designed to shut down the process and activate cooling when the process reaches high pressure, high temperature, l"

It can be manual or heat activated \n7 Fire Water Spray Monitors: Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress allyl alcohol vapors.\n7 Surveillance: Operators routinely monitor the process.\n\nEthylene Oxide:  This scenario assumes a 1-inch drain valve on the ethylene oxide pipeline is damaged by heavy equipment during maintenance, causing a 1/32-inch wide x >-inch long crack to develop in a weld.  The result is a release of ethylene oxide at a rate of 125 pounds per minute for 20 minutes. According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\nThe following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n7 Low Pressure Alarm and Shutdown System:  This shutdown system is designed to sound an alarm when a drop in pressure occurs, which is indicative of a leak and shuts the ethylene oxide distribution system down.\n7 Remote Actuated Valves on Header:  This valve can be remotely actuated by an operator to isolate a leak on the ethylene oxide distribution piping.  This quick action can minimize the amount of material released.\n7 Manual Shut-Off Valve:  This valve can be closed by an operator to isolate ethylene oxide flow to plant ethylene oxide distribution system.\nThis scenario assumes the emergency shutdown device detects and shuts down the ethylene oxide distribution system and the operator activates remote a"
