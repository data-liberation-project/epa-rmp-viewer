A primary aspect of this commitment is the Cypress Chemical Company system to help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \nIn the event of an accidental release, the Cypress Chemical Company has procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The Cypress Chemical Company's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies. Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Cypress Chemical Company established a management system headed by the Vice-President to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n2.0  Cypress Chemical Company and Regulated Substances\n\n\nCypress Chemical Company, located in West Helena, Arkansas, is primarily involved in the manufacture of agricultural fertilizer products.  To manufacture our products, Cypress Chemical Company utilizes one regulated substance in sufficient quantity to be covered by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  The following table lists the Cypress Chemical Company's covered process under the RMP Rule and the associated Regulated Substance with its respect"

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that Cypress Chemical Company has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, Cypress Chemical Company has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a 30,000 gallon storage tank of NH3 when filled to the controlled 80% of capacity level.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating NH3 would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for NH3 releases is a release from a severed pipe in the storage tank area.  The modeled release lasted for 60 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating NH3 would reach of"

The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Ammonium Sulfate Granulation Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\n\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nThe Cypress Chemical Company maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\n* physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n* chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\n* operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\n* design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\n* specific chemical inventories.\n \n The Cypress Chemical Company ensures that the process safety information is available to all Cypress Chemical Company employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  The Plant Maintenance Manager is responsible for maintaining and updating this information, as needed.\n Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of NH3 and other chemicals used in our processes.  Information regarding toxicity, environmental impacts, corrosion concerns, inadvertent mixing hazards, and other safety and health concerns are addressed and communicated to the appropriate parties.\n The Cypress Chemical Company also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to aid in the safe and proper operation of the process.  These documents are used to:\n\n* train employees,\n* perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\n* help maintain the equipment.\n\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the Ammonium Sulfate Granulation Process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Cypress Chemical Company performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the Ammonium Sulfate Granulation Process to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  Within this program, the Ammonium Sulfate Granulation Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nTo perform the PHAs, Cypress Chemical Company primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Ammonium Sulfate Granulation Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when "

Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the Plant Maintenance Manager and is tracked through completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Cypress Chemical Company periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Ammonium Sulfate Granulation Process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the Manager of Pulp for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nCypress Chemical Company engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Ammonium Sulfate Granulation Process operation should be safely performed.  These written procedures address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n* \nunit startup,\n* normal operations,\n* temporary operations,\n* emergency shutdown,\n* normal shutdown, and\n* initial startup of a new process.\n \n The written operating procedures include:\n \n* steps for safely conducting process tasks,\n* applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations, and\n* safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and action(s) to take in the event of an exposure to a hazardous substance.\n\n4.4  Training\n\nThe Cypress Chemical Company trains workers to safely and effectively perform their "
