These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  \r\n\r\nManagement of Change:  Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the changed.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:  Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \r\n\r\n&#8195;\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nOn January 6, 2015 at approximately 3:45 pm, the Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant experienced an NGL release and fire.  The release was caused by a rupture in the 3 diameter lean amine line that is connected to the amine contactor pressure vessel.  When the line ruptured, NGL in the pressurized contactor flowed into the amine line and out through the rupture opening, forming a vapor cloud that ignited upon reaching an ignition source.  Gas monitor alarms were triggered, the facility ESD activated, and the four staff members on site immediately evacuated.  There were no personnel injuries.  The fire burned until 7:00 am the following morning, at which time the NGL fuel source in the contactor was exhausted.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction, LP-Gas handling and storage facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Response Plan, which is linked with the Beckham County Emergency Management District Emergency Response Plan.  Activation of this emergency response plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies.  Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly.  The 911 call is channeled through the Beckham County Sheriff's Department.  All agencies and personnel respond to predetermined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the Central Command Post (CP).  A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with other emergency response personnel from responding agencies, as needed. \r\n\r\nBeckham County LEPC Chairperson\r\nBill Bankston\r\nP.O.

      "SummaryText": "Introduction and Policies\r\n\r\nSweetwater Gas Processing Plant, owned and operated by Midcoast G&P (Oklahoma) L.P., is committed to the same quality of safety and environmental excellence that all other Midcoast assets promote.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\r\n\r\nThe Sweetwater Gas Plant is a natural gas plant that extracts natural gas liquids (NGLs) from natural gas.   The plant  receives, stores and introduces natural gas liquids (NGLs) into the pipeline for sale to wholesale markets. After arriving at the facility via pipeline and going through stabilization, the regulated flammable liquids recovered from the  inlet stream are stored in (1) 90,000 gallon NGL tank pending removal via truck or an NGL sales pipeline.  The remaining natural gas is then routed to the amine contactor for acid gas removal. From there the natural gas stream is routed to the gycol dehydration unit to remove any remaining water.  The recovered water is sent to a produced water tank and the natural gas stream enters the mole seive dehydration beds for further dehydration.  The gas stream is then sent to the cyrogenic process where the gas is expanded and cooled producing the N"

      "SummaryText": "GL.  The NGL is routed through (2) 29,000 gallon NGL surge tanks prior to sale via pipeline.  There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present.  The facility consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the plant's compression as well as the NGL tanks.  As such, the Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \r\n\r\n&#8195;\r\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAs specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst-case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the liquids in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant, this would involve our 90,000 gallon flammable natural gas liquids tank (339,130 pounds).  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPAs RMP Comp calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.5 miles (approximately 2,640 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite consequences is calculated to reach approximately 0.3 miles (approximately 1,585 feet) from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPAs RMP Comp, which is known to be highly conservative and should over predict any potential release from such a scenario.  We have selected the alternative release scenario based on a release from ou"

This incident could occur if a truck backs into the tank or piping is broken off of the tank in the event that a truck drives off while load lines are still connected.  Additionally, this sceanrio would account for any potential releases from process piping including flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals, Any releases from vessels including drains, bleeds, cracks, seal failures, plug failures, overfiling, overpressurization, and venting would also be accounted for in this scenario.   As a method of preventing such events, signs are posted in conspicuous locations to provide constant reminders to the drivers about proper unloading techniques.\r\n\r\nMidcoast has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Henderson County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant.
