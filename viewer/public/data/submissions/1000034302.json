Ammonia at greater than 20% is stored at the Ammonia Treatment Plant and is covered by Prevention Program 2.  \n\n \n\nPrevention Program Level 2:  Ammonia Treatment Plant\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Review (PHR) Team for Ammonia Treatment Plant is comprised of the following: Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer (team leader), Treatment Plant operator, Site Risk Management Plan Preparer, Regulatory Engineer, and Site Fire Marshall.  The results of each PHR are recorded and maintained on file.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures for the Ammonia Treatment Plant were originally written by the manufacturer and design firms, with input from Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer and involved employees using technical process data and safety information.  Changes to the operating procedures are made by the Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer and/or Lead Operator.  The operating procedures are reviewed annually by Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer, all operators, and the department manager.  The Ammonia Treatment Plant operating and maintenance procedures are maintained on-line and are available to appropriate Ammonia Treatment Plant Personnel (i.e., engineer, operators, manager).\n\n\n\nTraining for the Ammonia Treatment Plant Operation is formulated and tracked by the  Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer and training records are maintained by managers of D/9XMA and D92D.\n\n\n\nIncident investigation program follows the IBM incident report procedure in the Safety & Health Manual for fact determination, root cause a"

All incidents are investigated to determine root cause and system deficiency correction.\n\n\n\nNo accidents/incidents have occurred involving the Ammonia Treatment Plant in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe Facility emergency response plan defines response organizations, coordination with local emergency responders, equipment, response procedures, training, notifications procedures and drills.  The plan is updated according to the recommendations resulting from system deficiencies identified by periodic drills.\n\n"
