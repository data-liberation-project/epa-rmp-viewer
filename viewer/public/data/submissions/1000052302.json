      "SummaryText": "The City of Forest has seven water wells that supply the customers of the City of Forest. We use chlorine to disinfect the water that we supply. The City has two full time employees in which are all trained in chlorine safety and how to handle any accidental release of chlorine. The two operators of the water wells have one self-contained air packs and are trained in how to handle any release of chlorine. Also the City of Forest Fire Department  has one complete ton emergency repair kit and the fire fighters are trained in how to handle a chlorine release. This is our emergency response call list: H. Randall George, Public Works Director, 601-507-2921; Jerry Tillman, Water Well Superintendent, 601-519-3808; James Johnson, Water Well Technician, 769-274-9665; City of Forest Fire Department, 601-469-1221; Jason Tillman, Fire Chief, 601-507-7310; Forest Police Department, 601-469-4141; Will Jones, Chief of Police, 769-274-0790. The Fire Dept. is trained to put up a water curtain if needed to contain the release as much as possible. We also have a chlorine sensor and alarm to alert the operator with the use of an automated dialer that dials pagers. Also we have two more complete ton chlorine cylinder repair kits with four additional self-contained air packs at the wastewater treatment plant. The operator at the water wells checks all of the chlorination systems at least daily. If we have a release that requires people to evacuate for a certain area we use the police dept. and all forces to accomplish this action."
