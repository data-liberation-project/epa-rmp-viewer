If an emergency were to occur, it is Rymes policy to notify the Lebanon Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\nDescription of facility and the regulated substance handled: This facility transfers retail LPG, supplying retail outlets. The facility consists of a 34,500 gallon rail car tank and will be installing a temporary 15,000 gallon skid tank on site for the winter.  This tank will be removed and replaced with two (2) 30,000 gallon LP tanks at a later date. There is also a 200 gallon tank for heating.  Each tank is filled to 80% capacity.  \r\n\r\nAlong the inside track, there will be three (3) transloaders.  Rymes Heating states that the propane being unloaded from the railcar is never in storage and therefore SFC looked at the compliancy of the distances between the facility's point of transfer and various locations specified in NFPA 58 Table 6.5.3. There was no need to look at the separation distances for any large storage propane tank as none exist within the facility.  A site plan is attached at the end of this RMP for better clarification.\r\n\r\nWorst case release scenario: Rymes worst case release scenario is failure of the 34,500 gallon rail car tank when filled to its greatest amount allowed (80% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. This worst case scenario would affect all people within the distance to the specified endpoint. This encompasses all who reside 0.4 miles away from the facility or closer.\r\n\r\nFive year accident history: The Rymes facility has never had an accident involving propane system that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations"

As a result of this being a program 3 facility, additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or release of a regulated substance from the process, residents living within the distance to the specified endpoint are exposed to danger. Also, entry into this area may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, the public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. In order to preserve the safety of the public, knowledgeable faculty from the Rymes facility must coordinate with the local fire department and authority in any case where it is perceived that an incident may occur. Action must take place to mitigate the effects of an emergency, such as evacuating residents up to the endpoint and blockading public roads. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete. It should be noted that information gathered from Rymes Heating was used to fulfill Sections 7 and 9. This facility is being classified as retail by Rymes Heating and it is at their request that these forms are being completed. SFC understands that retail facilities do not need risk management plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________                              _________________________\r\n   Signature\t\t\t\t\t        Print Name\r\n\r\n_________________________"
