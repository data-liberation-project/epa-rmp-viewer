The company takes the safety of all affected parties seriously and attempts to mitigate potential hazards by training employees.\n\nCompany Statement of Philosophy on Safety: Hudsonville Creamery and Ice Cream Company is committed to providing a safe environment for team members and visitors.  Safety training and policies are designed to communicate the foundations that enhance workplace safety.\n\n\nHudsonville Ice Cream Facility and Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nHudsonville Ice Cream and Creamery, LLC is a producer of ice cream for consumers.  The facility employs roughly forty-five full-time employees.  The facility is located at 345 E. 48th Street in Holland, Michigan.  The facility is shared with another tenant.  \n\nIce cream production and storage requires refrigeration.  A very efficient and effective method to refrigerate this product is by the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical in both its liquid and vapor state.  Anhydrous ammonia is present at the facility in both liquid and vapor states.  The ammonia is used to cool, freeze and store the product at the facility.  There is approximately 16,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia on site at the Hudsonville Ice Cream facility.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nHudsonville Ice Cream and Creamery, LLC fall under OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  Facilities fall into this regulation if they have over a threshold quantity of a highly hazardous chemical on site.  The threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs.  The facility also falls under the EPA?s Risk Management Planning (RMP) regulation 40 C"

      "SummaryText": "FR Part 68 due to the anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIn maintaining a safe facility as well as complying with these regulations, Hudsonville Ice Cream has developed certain practices to promote the safe operation of the anhydrous ammonia system.  These practices range from technological safeguards and backup systems, to proper maintenance of equipment and training of affected employees. \n\n\nThe five-year accident history\n\nHudsonville Ice Cream?s new facility has had no accidents.  Operations are scheduled to begin in October of 2004.\n\n\nThe emergency response program\n\nThe emergency response for Hudsonville Ice Cream is coordinated through the Allegan County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The LEPC has developed the Off-Site Spill Response Plan for the facility.  The facility is equipped with alert and notification systems.  The employees are trained in evacuating the facility.  There is no HAZMAT team in place at the facility, as the local emergency response authorities will handle major releases.  \n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nAs the facility is new and the safety system has been recently completed, there are no plans to change the safety information at this time."
