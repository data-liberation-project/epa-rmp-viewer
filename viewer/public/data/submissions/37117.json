(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Lufkin, Texas which is referenced as the ?plant? throughout the remainder of the document. The facility is located on East Lufkin Avenue. The resin facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1962 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins. The formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1977. Both of these processes contain a raw material tank farm, the process equipment itself and a finished product tank farm.   Overall, the facility employs 68 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n?a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP ru"

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program a"

GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the local voluntary fire department.  In order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the facility safety coordinator, to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 Regulated Substances\nThe Plant handles one regulated substance in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, which is Formaldehyde.\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis:  \nThe OCA was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 68, Subpart B.  The OCA is summarized in Section 2-5 of the RMP Registration.\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSince 1962, the Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are used to (l) train employees, (2) perform process hazards analyses, (3) evaluate process changes, and (4) help maintain the equipment.\n\n1.4.1.2 Process Hazard Analysis\nThe Plant performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the ?what-if /checklist? in combination with HAZOP guidewords PHA methodology to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n1.4.1.3 Operating Procedures\nPlant process engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.

The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the plant?s processes and as a training guide.\n\n\n1.4.1.4 Training\nThe Plant trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Computer-based training modules, classroom training, and on-the-job training with experienced operators are used to conduct this training.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process. The operators are consulted annually at safety meetings to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Refresher training is conducted on a minimum of every three (3) years.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\n1.4.1.5  Mechanical Integrity\nThe Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.
