In addition, the Manual addresses the facility's actions as a non-responding site to address the Emergency Response requirements of 40 CFR 68.90.\n\n<>The five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe Endeavor facility has had zero (0) RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years. \n\n<>The emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nIn the event of an emergency, facility employees will notify the local emergency responders identified in the Emergency Action Plan to respond and will evacuate when needed.  Additional details related to emergency procedures can be located in the facility's Emergency Action Plan that is included in Section 4 of the Risk Management Program & Process Safety Management Program Manual.\n\n<>Planned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nThe facility completed an update to the initial process hazard analysis in August 2023 that documented the actions taken on recommendations for enhanced process safety from the previous PHA report. In August 2018, the facility implemented additional maintenance inspections and continues to evaluate additional steps to improve process safety."
