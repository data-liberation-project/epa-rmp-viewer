The City of Homestead track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals. Furthermore, the City of Homestead has taken a comprehensive approach to be in full compliance with the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Harris Field Water Treatment Plant.\r\n\r\nHarris Field Water Treatment Plant personnel do not have the specialized equipment or training to respond to a major release. Therefore, the Emergency Response program focuses on procedures to identify chemical releases, safely evacuate plant personnel, and notify the local emergency responders (fire, police, and HAZMAT) who are responsible for implementing the incident command system (ICS) and coordinating all response actions.\r\n\r\n2.0  Harris Field Water Treatment Plant and Chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe City of Homestead owns and operates the Harris Field Water Treatment Plant. The facility's mission is to protect public health by providing our community with safe drinking water, free of harmful pathogens.  Approximately 95 pounds per day of chlorine gas is used to disinfect the water and make it safe for human consumption. \r\n\r\nHarris Field Water Treatment Plant injects chlorine to the water system by use of a vacuum feed system. This system will automatically shut-off at loss of vacuum to prevent unwanted escape of gases into the atmosphere. The chlorine storage tanks are located away from possible traffic and are enclosed by a poured concrete structure building with perimeter fencing.                    \r\n\r\n3.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps.\r\n\r\nThe Harris Field Water Treatment Plant complies with all rules and regulations that pertain to the safe storage and use of chlorine.
