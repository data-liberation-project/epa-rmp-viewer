The development of safety awareness can only come through each person's acceptance of his responsibility for safety in conjunction with adequate job orientation, training, recognition and communication of the hazards associated with each work situation. Everyone must believe that all accidents are either preventable or avoidable.\n\nEffective management of our process safety is critical in maintaining the integrity of our operations. All necessary equipment, tools, technologies, procedures, and training will be provided to assist everyone in operating our processes and performing their jobs safely. At the PolyOne Corporation, every job and operation must be managed safely.  \n\nSafety performance will be a key element of each employee's and contractor's performance evaluation.  Excellence in safety performance is a condition of employment at PolyOne Corporation.  \n\nThe prevention of accidents while off the job is equally important. The same principles at work are also effective in preventing accidents in the home, on the highway and in all other activities.\n\nWorking and living safely must be our way of life. \n\n\n REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nPolyOne Corporation is regulated under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA), which regulate the management of process safety.  The OSHA Process Safety Management Standard regulation is designed to protect workers from catastrophic process incidents and the TCPA regulation is designed to protect the public and the environment.

Vinyl Chloride is used to manufacture dispersion speciality resins.  It is polymerized (reacted and converted) into polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which is an inert plastic.  This conversion takes place in a closed computerized process using state of the art technology.  The product is then dried, packaged and shipped to customers.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to make chilled water.  The chilled water is used to remove heat from the dispersion manufacturing process.\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe NJDEP and the USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what is defined as a worse-case release scenario.  Companies are also required to analyze an alternative release scenario.  \n\nThe worse-case scenario is a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of any toxic material or flammable listed under the regulations as determined by USEPA.  The USEPA mandates that companies presume the release of the entire quantity of the substance in ten (10) minutes.  PolyOne Corporation could not consider the numerous prevention and emergency response systems, procedures, equipment, controls, and trained employees that are in place as part of this scenario.\n\nThe alternative case scenario is a more credible scenario that is closer to a real world incident.  Facilities are allowed to include active safety systems.  Active safety systems include procedures and equipment which are used to contain or minimize the impact of an accidental release.  Examples of active safety systems are detection systems, computer controlled valves, fire protection systems and employee actions.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nPolyOne Corporation has one regulated flammable substance: Vinyl Chloride (VCM) CA"

This tank has a capacity of 5,000 gallons; however, written operating procedures and high level alarms prevent more than 4,000 gallons from being present at one time.  Failure of this tank would release 4,000 gallons (31,000 pounds) of Vinyl Chloride.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released within ten minutes and find an ignition source.  The result is a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance from the source to its endpoint is 0.22 miles.

This heat exchanger has a capacity of 1,850 gallons; however, written operating procedures and high level alarms prevent more than 650 gallons from being present at one time. Failure of this heat exchanger would release 650 gallons (3,500 pounds) of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released within ten minutes.
