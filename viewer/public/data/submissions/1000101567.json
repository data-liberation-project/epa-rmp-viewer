An Incident Management Team is staffed with Site Management, Engineering, Safety, Logistics and Emergency Responders. The site is a member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA). CIMA supplements on-site emergency responders in the event it may be needed. The facility is involved with the CAER network to communicate with the local community in the event of an emergency. \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years at the facility which meet the reporting criteria of the RMP rule. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nSignificant emergency response capital investments were made recently at the facility including the construction of a new administration building. The building includes a dedicated and upgraded Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and a dedicated Incident Management Team (IMT) conference room. Site security has been improved, including upgraded perimeter surveillance cameras and other advanced access controls. Emergency response capability has been improved by replacing a number of firewater pumps and motors and by procuring new CIMA radios for mutual aid response. The INEOS Olefins and Polymers risk assessment process uses Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to systematically assess risk and continually improve event detection and mitigation. Capital projects are continually identified and implemented through this risk assessment process."

This includes the review of all contractors prior to working on or near the covered process. The contractor must submit information that indicates the work can be performed competently and safely. The company will provide information on the hazards of the process and the safety practices in place. Documents are kept to confirm that the information was received and understood. In addition, procedures are in place which require the entrance, presence, and exit of contractors to be controlled. \r\n13.\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps - In addition to engineering review and hazard analysis previously mentioned, workers who perform operations involving covered chemicals receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures. In addition, several equipment safeguards are in place such as hydrocarbon detection, automated deluge systems, related piping and vessel periodic inspection and maintenance, and continuous process monitoring for operations. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program \r\n\r\nAn established written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and other federal contingency plans is in effect at the facility. This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Regular dialogue is maintained between the facility and the local response personnel.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \r\n6.\tManagement of Change - A change management tool is utilized to ensure the proper reviews are conducted, hazards assessed, and a safe operation is maintained during and after a permanent or temporary change is implemented to the process. Each MOC includes a risk assessment to identify the potential hazards of the change as well as a review of the supplemental checklist which is used to identify additional documentation and communication requirements and to raise questions that may not surface during the risk assessment. Approval and action items are tracked in the MOC database. \r\n7.\tPre-Startup Safety Review -- PSSRs are performed whenever the process is modified in a manner which requires updating of process safety information. This review confirms (1) proper equipment was used, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are updated, (3) a risk assessment has been conducted, and (4) training has been implemented. \r\n8.\tCompliance Audits - PSM and RMP compliance audits are performed at least every three years. Audits targeting specific regulatory element requirements may be performed more frequent through the Operational Audit process, if needed. Since this is a newly-constructed facility, the initial PSM and RMP compliance audits have not yet been performed.\r\n9.\tIncident Investigation - All incidents that actually resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release are investigated. The incident investigation procedure requires an investigation team to be assembled and that the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.

Procedures used for conducting PHAs and the qualitative assessment of risk include consideration of off-site consequences and harm to the environment or the public. \r\n3.\tOperating Procedures - the facility maintains its operating procedures under an ISO9000 program. As such, it is required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and contractors and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. \r\n4.\tTraining - To complement the written procedures for process operations, a comprehensive training program has been implemented for all workers involved in operating the process. The training program includes initial training, on-the-job training and classroom training. A unit walkthrough test and final peer review panel ensure a required level of practical knowledge by operators. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n5.\tMechanical Integrity - Well-established practices and procedures are used to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
