We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n?  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) regulation\n?  An overview of our accident release prevention programs\n?  The five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n?  An overview of our emergency response program\n?  An overview of the improvements made at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, public and the environment\n?  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n?  The detailed information about our risk management program \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nThe Neal facility produces polypropylene using a variety of chemicals and unit operations. The process utilizes the regulated flammable substance propylene along with catalyst and hydrogen as feedstock.  The process contains the RMP regulated substance propylene above the threshold quantity in storage vessels and numerous reactors, columns, tanks and piping within the unit. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards of these chemicals that are posed to employees, the public and the environment.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe centerpiece of the accident release and pre"

This is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We take a systematic and proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n?  Process safety information\n?  Process hazard analysis\n?  Operating procedures\n?  Training\n?  Mechanical integrity\n?  Management of change\n?  Pre-startup review\n?  Compliance audits\n?  Incident investigation\n?  Employee participation\n?  Hot work permit\n?  Contractors\n\nWe actively encourage participation from all employees in every aspect of process safety management. The process safety information on chemicals used, process technology and equipment design is readily available to all employees. Employees participate in PHA revalidation studies and PHA studies required by our Management of Change program. Procedures provide knowledge to ensure employees perform their jobs safely and correctly. Employee suggestions for improvement are encouraged. Experienced employees are involved in training. Employees and contractors are trained and included in the investigation of incidents and accidents.\n\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change policy, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews ensure that new installations or modifications are safe for startup and continued operation. Our Mechanical Integrity Program has written procedures to assure that the affected process equipment is properly and safely maintained. The Neal plant?s Hot Work Permit policy is strictly enforced to ensure that hot work in potentially dangerous areas does not occur.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business. We have specific accountabilities and c"
