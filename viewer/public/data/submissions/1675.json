As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) requires a submission of a plan describing its Risk Management Program, and this document is intended to satisfy those requirements (per 40 CFR 68).\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of a hazard assessment, a prevention program and an emergency response program.  The RMP is only one component of a more comprehensive safety program at the GP/Brunswick facility.  This plan is only intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and/or the environment.  In order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President- Fluff Pulp & Bleached Board.\n\n1.2\tGeorgia-Pacific Brunswick Operations and Our Regulated Substance\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Brunswick Operations is a pulp mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related paper products, and handles Chlorine Dioxide (C102) in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.

The off site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release case scenarios. The main objective of performing the off site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the end point distance).  \n\n1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process- Chlorine Dioxide (C102) Solution System\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the chlorine dioxide is the complete rupture of the facility's two C102 Storage Tanks. The North and South C102 storage tanks contain 733,278 gallons of chlorine dioxide in solution at 14.0 grams per liter. The tanks are equalized with a pipe, and are considered one storage vessel for the purpose of the analysis. \n\nThe RMP rule mandates, that for the worst-case scenario, the analysis assumes loss of the entire storage in ten minutes.  Since there is no dike around the storage tanks, the chlorine dioxide solution would spread to a minimum depth (1 cm) and evaporate to form a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic end point concentration, based on the EPA Lookup Table approach, is greater than 25 miles. The United States Census indicates that approximately 80,937 people live within this distance from the storage tanks.  Several public and environmental receptors are also located within this distance\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of an 8 inch chlorine dioxide solution line located at the discharge side of the C102 transfer pumps' h"

During normal operations, three pumps, with a 1200 gallon per minute pumping capacity, are utilized. \n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes that the 3600 gallons per minute of solution is released from the discharge line of the transfer pumps' header for a maximum of 5 minutes before workers detect the release and shut down the pumps. The released chlorine dioxide solution will form a pool of minimum depth (1 cm) and evaporate to form a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic end point concentration, based on the EPA Lookup Table approach, is 4.6 miles. The United States Census indicates that approximately 32,843 people live within this distance from the discharge line at the chlorine dioxide solution transfer pumps. Several public and environmental receptors are also located within this distance. \n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nGP/Brunswick has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances, but it formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program in 1992. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established that a Program Level 3 Prevention Program would become a requirement for these processes as well. \n\n1.4.1 The following sections briefly describe the elements of the GP/Brunswick Program Level 3 Prevention Program:\n\n1. Employee Participation The facility has developed a written employee participation program which encourages active participation from personnel in the development and maintenance of the prevention program. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, the RMP rule and development of PHA's and operating procedures.\n\n2. Process Safety Information The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the processes.

Documents such as material safety data sheets (MSDS) report the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the facility and are available to all employees and the Emergency Response Team. \n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis.  GP/Brunswick performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process. The facility primarily uses the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) and/or \"What If'\" technique, supplemented with checklist, to perform this analysis. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including recommendations which could enhance the safety of the process.\n\n4. Operating Procedures. GP/Brunswick operators, supervisors, and engineers work together to develop and maintain accurate operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed on an annual basis. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and upset (initial startup, normal and emergency shutdowns, temporary operations and startup following a standby condition) operating conditions. \n\n5. Training. GP/Brunswick trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. The facility training program for process operators includes both the initial training and refresher training that covers the properties and hazards of the substance in the process and safe work practices.  Written and oral tests are used to verify comprehension of the training material.  Operators are consulted annually about the materials to"

GP/Brunswick has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the facility are performed in a safe manner. The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the facility only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  GP/Brunswick explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work and requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work on or near a covered process before that employee begins work at the site. \n\n7. Pre-startup Safety Reviews.  GP/Brunswick performs a safety review of new or modified equipment in the covered process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely. This review confirms that construction and equipment operations are in accordance with design specifications and adequate safety and emergency procedures are in place.  A checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that the appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n8. Mechanical Integrity.  GP/Brunswick maintains the mechanical integrity of the covered process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. The facility mechanical integrity program includes an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in GP/Brunswick covered processes. \n\n9.

The GP/Brunswick \"management of change\" program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be replacements in kind are allowed without completing a \"management of change\" form. All other changes must be confirmed through the full \"management of change\" program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of the process changes are prevented, safety consequences of the changes are addressed, affected process safety information and operating procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n11. Incident Investigations.  GP/Brunswick investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented. The facility trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  If an incident occurs, a team is assembled and initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigations are documented, recommendations are resolved and appropriate process enhancements are implemented where required.\n\n12. Compliance Audits.  GP/Brunswick audits the covered processes to be certain that the facility's prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the operations.  An audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process is assembled and evaluates if the program is sufficient to help ensure safe operations of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented where required.\n\n1.4.2\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required preven"

The emergency response plan includes procedures for informing the local response organizations and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in off site consequences.  It can also provide proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances at the facility if needed.  The team is trained in all aspects of emergency response and rescue, periodically conducts drills and will coordinate at least one annually with the local fire department, and maintains its equipment on-site. \n\nThe written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations and will be communicated to local emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee. The facility will maintain a regular dialogue with the LEPC to ensure that the plan is adequate to address emergencies which may arise."
