Management of the facility has passed to the facility owner, who changed the facility name.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used on-site at the Chelan Manson Fruit 11 facility.  Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:  Prevent unnecessary human exposure; Reduce the threat to our personnel; Reduce the threat to the community; and, Reduce the threat to the environment.  \n\n\n\nThe facility is a cold storage warehouse located near the City of Chelan, in the County of Chelan, State of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is used as a refrigerant. There is approximately 14,412 pounds of ammonia in the overall facility which is approximately 137,200 sq ft warehouse with multiple vessels and extensive piping.  The largest vessel could potentially release 6,369 pounds of ammonia. There are no other hazardous substances on-site that meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the following:\n\nContinuing training for personnel\n\nMaintenance programs as described in the PSM program\n\nUse of safety equipment and procedures\n\nUse of accurate, effective written operating procedures, and\n\nIntensive Mechanical Integrity program\n\n\n\nChelan Manson Fruit 11 complies with OSHA and WA State process safety management rules and regulations, WA State safety regulations, and IIAR standards for good work practices.  The ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Piping and equipment are secured and protected, engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems used include:\n\nComputeriz"

Procedures are kept in the refrigeration office.  These procedures include:\n\nShut down procedures (routine and emergency)\n\nPre-start up safety procedures\n\nRoutine operations\n\nMaintenance of all equipment\n\nResponse to major and minor releases\n\nEmergency action plan\n\n\n\nChelan Manson Fruit 11 has had no accidents involving ammonia in the last five years.\n\n\n\nIn addition to operating procedures, Chelan Manson Fruit 11 has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing safety training.  The response plan is coordinated with Chelan County Fire District 7.\n\n\n\nTraining on ammonia safety and detailed mechanical integrity are a major ongoing process at Chelan Manson Fruit 11.  Review and update of the emergency plan is done annually.  Drills and emergency evacuation practices are executed semi-annually.  Training is required for all employees who work around the ammonia system, including fork lift personnel.  "
