There are two, independent closed-loop, mechanical refrigeration system at this location. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pump or pressure to the production and process area evaporators and heat exchangers for cooling and freezing purposes. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the evaporators returns to the suction vessels in the engine room. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 125 to 185 psig. The maximum allowable working pressure is 250 psig. The quantity of ammonia used in the Line 1 system is 8,646 lbs.; the quantity of ammonia in the Line 2 system is 14,534 lbs.\r\nAs part of the PSM program, Monogram Appetizers has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Monogram Appetizers implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Monogram Appetizers to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Plover, WI facility.
