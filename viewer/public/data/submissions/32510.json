This regulation was developed to provide information to the public and help local emergency planning committees better prepare for the unlikely event of a disaster involving one of the facilities covered chemicals.  The Louisiana Mill has a strong and safe history in the community.  Although the mill was originally built in the 1920\u00bfs, wise investment of capital and innovative uses of technical improvements have helped the mill maintain its status as a \u00bfflagship\u00bf of the International Paper systems.\n\nRegulated substances under the RMP include chlorine and chlorine dioxide, which have always been at the facility and used in a safe manner.  These chemicals are used for water treatment and pulp bleaching, respectively.  The mill has not had any incidents during the past five year accident history.  Mill employees are trained regularly in the safe handling of these materials and the facility also has its own highly trained Emergency Response Team, which has members on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week all year.  This team works and trains with members of the Bastrop Fire Department and other emergency response organizations.  The mill is a leader in participating with the local LEPC as well.  \n\nIP was required to develop a worst case scenario for each chemical.  A computer model or mathematical calculation was performed on each chemical to determine how far away it could effect the environment and community.  The regulation specifies every condition used for the model.  It even specifies the weather conditions at which the release occurs.  Our worst case scenario does have off site consequences effecting public receptors.\n\nAn alternative release scenario was also done.  This is a more realistic scenari"

From these scenarios community emergency planning exercises are planned and drills performed to assure all emergency response agencies are prepared to deal with any potential hazards to the public and community in general in the event of an accidental release of these chemicals.  Our alternative release scenario does have offsite consequences effecting public receptors.  \n\nOf course, we have several preventative measures to assure that these scenarios won\u00bft become reality.  Some chemicals have been eliminated, or reduced in quantity at the site.  We perform nondestructive testing, visual inspections, interlock testing, and preventive maintenance routes on the equipment.  Also, we have a system in place to manage any changes to the system to assure all safety considerations have been taken.  Next, we assure operators are properly trained and certified to operate the system.  Also, we have safety devices, alarms, and interlocks.  Finally, we participate in emergency preparedness training.\n\nIn summary, we feel that proper planning and training has been done to ensure that the mill operates in a safe manner and is not a threat to our community.  We take pride in our past performance and will work for continuous improvement of our systems and our employees\u00bf ability to handle hazardous materials in the future as well."
