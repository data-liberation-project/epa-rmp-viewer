      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nAt Solutia?s W.G. Krummrich Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community, as well as the protection of the environment.  The executive summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA?s RMP regulation\n?    An overview of our accidental release programs\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA?s RMP rule\n?    An overview of our emergency response program\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nThe information supplied in this RMP submittal is accurate and up-to-date.  Since the initial RMP submittal in 1999, the W.G. Krummrich plant has significantly changed.  Several processes have been shut down.   These shutdowns have reduced two RMP chemicals at the site to below their threshold amounts; Anhydrous Ammonia and Nitric Acid have been eliminated.  The on-site storage volume of Chlorine and Aqueous Ammonia has been significantly reduced.\n\n1.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe W.G. Krummrich Plant is the second oldest of the U.S. Solutia Plants, with approximately 150 employees.  In 1917, as part of Monsanto, the site was purchased from the Commercial Acids Company, which had started the plant in 1907 to manufacture sulfuric, muriatic and nitric acids.  Today the plant occupies over 94 acres and manufactures a variety of chemical intermediates.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite cons"

Krummrich plant as a recovered material that is stored for sale.\n\n-Chlorine\n\nSuppliers ship chlorine in rail cars to the W.G. Krummrich plant.  Solutia has implemented strict unloading and handling procedures for this material.  A number of 90-ton rail cars are stored in the plant and are used by one department.   The chlorine is used directly from the rail cars through state-of-the-art unloading systems.  Solutia?s W. G. Krummrich plant uses chlorine as a raw material in the manufacture of building block chemicals used to make swimming pool, potable water and other water treatment products.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n2.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:  \n\n?    Process safety information\n?    Process hazard analysis\n?    Operating procedures\n?    Training\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n?    Management of Change\n?    Pre-startup review\n?    Compliance audits\n?    Incident Investigation\n?    Employee participation\n?    Hot work permit\n?    Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention effort, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nDESIGNING for Safety\n\n?    Vessels are designed and constructed under American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) code standards.\n?    All systems and components are designed to meet or exceed government standards.\n?    Leak detection systems are utilized for detection of leaks within the process.\n?    Fail-safe and pressure relief valves are utilized.\n?    The use of flow controller and/or regulator systems.\n?    "
