The CAA makes it clear that facilities that handle hazardous substances bear the primary responsibility for ensuring their safe use.  This statutory mandate required EPA to establish a list of regulated substances as well as propose elements of an accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nUnder the requirements of Section 112(r), stationary sources (facility) must identify and assess their chemical hazards and implement certain activities that are designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases.  Also, facility must submit a risk management plan (RMP) that summarizes these activities, and the plans will be available to state and local governments, the public and other stakeholders.  The hazard assessment data disclosed by facility can be used by local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) and other local response agencies to improve community emergency response planning.  Also, the information in the risk management plan gives citizens the opportunity to work with industry to reduce risks to the community from chemical accidents.\n\n\n\nThe final RMP rule spells out requirements for the following basic components of a risk management program that regulated facility must implement:\n\n\n\n?    A hazard assessment program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, training, and management of change, process safety information, etc., for operations involving regulated substances;\n\n?    An emergency response program to mitigate any accidental releases that occur; and \n\n?    An overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management program.\n\n\n\nA description of t"

Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance at this facility above the threshold quantity levels established by EPA.  This facility uses an anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in quantities requiring an RMP (under present EPA regulation).  Anhydrous ammonia, NH3, is a colorless gas at ambient temperature or pressure; it is, however, usually stored as a liquid under pressure or refrigeration.  The gas is less dense than air, but when liquid ammonia is releases it may aerosolize and behave as a dense gas.  The effects of ammonia inhalation range from irritation to severe respiratory injuries to death.  Ammonia is self-alarming; its strong odor is noticeable at small concentrations.  In general, people will not remain in the presence of ammonia so that the primary threat it to people who are unable to flee.  The ammonia refrigeration system is a series of interconnected vessels and piping, that compress and pump anhydrous ammonia to several rooms to cool, chill, and freeze items to specific temperatures.  Refrigeration equipment includes low pressure receivers, compressors, condensers, accumulators, evaporators, pumps, piping, instruments, controls, and valves.  The quantity of ammonia in the system is approximately 12,650 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  This facility complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia use, and it is American Cold Storage's (ACS) policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is ACS's policy to notify the Madison County LEPC, the Jackson Fire Department, and respond to the emergency.  A site specific emergency plan has been developed to address emergencies. \n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:  No accidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe general release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident "

The ACS-Jackson facility is required to comply with the most stringent EPA RMP and OSHA prevention programs.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, ACS-Jackson takes the following actions.  If any anhydrous ammonia release is likely to impact off-site, the local emergency services will be notified.  ACS-Jackson has an in-house team trained to Operations Level for initial response/containment.  ACS-Jackson employees are trained to use self-contained breathing equipment and have taken OSHA worker right-to-know training.\n\n"
