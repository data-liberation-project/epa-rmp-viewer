(FloMin) has reviewed and enhanced accidental release procedures and emergency response policies. These policies have been incorporated in the facility's Emergency Response Plan, Plant Safety Manual, Operating Manual, and Utilities Manual.\n\nThere are three substances at the FloMin facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR 68.  These substances are used in two processes at the facility to produce chemicals used primarily as reagents in the mining industry.  These substances and the specific process covered include:\n\n*Toxic Substances:\n\n--Carbon disulfide: This material is used in the sodium xanthate (XAN) process. The XAN process uses carbon disulfide as a reactant to produce sodium alkyl xanthate intermediates that are subsequently used in other facility processes to produce collection agents for the mining industry. The maximum quantity of carbon disuldife stored on-site is approximately 320,000 pounds. \n\n*Flammable Substances:\n\n--Ethylamine: This material is used in the thionocarbamate (TC) process. The TC process uses ethylamine as a reactant to produce collection agents for the mining industry.  The maximum amount of ethylamine stored on-site is approximately 180,000 pounds.\n\n--Methylamine: This material is used in the TC process in similar fashion as ethylamine. The maximum amount of methylamine stored on-site is approximately 88,000 pounds (pure). Methylamine is received and stored as a 40 percent solution in water. \n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with chemical-specific prevention steps has been developed. \n\nXAN Process (Carbon disulfide): The XAN Process prevention program includes the following process controls and mitigation systems:\n\n*Vents\n*Relief valves\n*Check valv"
