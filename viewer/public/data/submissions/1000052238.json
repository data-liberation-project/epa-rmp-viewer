If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Emergency Response/Contingency Plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\nFacility Information\n\n?    The Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\n?    Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, converted, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  \n\n?    Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in either a 15,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) or an 18,000-gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 144,177 pounds.\n\n?    Aqua ammonia is produced from anhydrous ammonia or received by truck and stored in six storage tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 317,660 gallons or 2,414,216 pounds.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario were evaluated for each of the regulated processes.  The results of the evaluation are provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\n\nSafety Information:  GAS ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees.
