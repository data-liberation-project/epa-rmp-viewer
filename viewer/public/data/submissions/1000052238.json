If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Emergency Response/Contingency Plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\r\nFacility Information\r\n\u00bf\tThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\r\n\u00bf\tAnhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, converted, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  \r\n\u00bf\tAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in either a 15,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) or an 18,000-gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 144,177 pounds.\r\n\u00bf\tAqua ammonia is produced from anhydrous ammonia or received by truck and stored in six storage tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 317,660 gallons or 2,414,216 pounds.\r\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario were evaluated for each of the regulated processes.  The results of the evaluation are provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\r\nSafety Information:  GAS ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees.

      "SummaryText": "t review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on \r\nAugust 17, 2015.\r\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the regulated processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on August 20, 2013.  Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\r\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The operating procedures were last reviewed on June 3, 2015.\r\nTraining:  The GAS Facility staff, as well as Tremont corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.  The training program was last reviewed on June 3, 2015.  The current training program is comprised of the following:\r\n\u00bf\tInitial employee training;\r\n\u00bf\tPeriodic refresher training;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\r\n\u00bf\tCompetency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\r\n\u00bf\tTraining records for each employee.\r\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspections were conducted in July 2015 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted in August 2015.\r\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years.  Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are mai"
