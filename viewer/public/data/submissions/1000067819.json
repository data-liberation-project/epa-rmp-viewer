Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nL'Oreal, USA (L'Oreal) is making a commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.

The facility currently receives and stores aerosol cans containing compressed gases and liquids.  Aerosol cans contain flammable mixtures.  The flammable mixtures are found mainly as propellants in small quantities (in 6 to 10 ounce aerosol cans intended for use as household or salon products).  The facility does not have any regulated toxic substances.  \n\n\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility is an EPA RMP Program 1 Level facility and a NJ TCPA Program 3 Level facility.\n\n\n\nIII. General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical -Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility will continue to address the RMP release prevention program with the following elements:\n\n \n\n- Safety Information: The L'Oreal Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the process.  These documents address hazards of the aerosols at the facility, process technology, and process equipment.\n\n\n\n- Hazard Review:  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\n- Operating Proced"
