Facility Policy\n\n                    The owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop\n                     are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of\n                      anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should \n                     occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,\n                     or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of\n                     the release to people and the environment.\n\n             2.   Facility Information\n\n\n                   The primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \n                   Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct\n                   application as a fertilizers for crop production \n                   nutrients.  \n                    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in a 30,000 gallon capacity\n                     tank at 85% full is 131,325# at the Blencoe, IA facility.  In addition, 42 - 1,000 gallon  nurse tanks are generally at this site, at a location north of the office .            \n\n                    \n         3.        The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n                     a.  The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the\n                     release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10\n                     minutes.  \n\n         "

The alternative release scenario based on the five-year history ( or the\n                     most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transer hose.  \n\n       4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n              Western Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\n              Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American\n              National Standards Institute Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety\n              and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and Handling of\n              Anhydrous Ammonia\".  In addition, we comply with all applicable federal (EPA), state\n              and local requirements.\n\n             Western Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"LP-Gas Safety Handbook\",\n             part of NFPA-58, 1998 Edition, as well as applicable portions of the National Propane\n             Gas Association (NPGA) Certified Training Program and safety bulletins, and the EPA's\n             accident prevention policies.  In addition, we comply with all applicable, state and local\n             requirements.\n\nOur ammonia systems are protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, barriers, manual shutoffs and emergency shutof valves.  All main storage tank and fill valves are locked when not in use.  The systems are inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guildelines in ANSI standards.  If pumps or valves need repair, repair is performed by an outside company or they are replaced.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  Training consists of classroom lecture, current video"
