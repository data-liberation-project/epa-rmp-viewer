The Insulation Systems Business Unit \n(ISB), of which the Kansas City Insulation Plant is a key part, \ndemonstrates this pursuit of excellence by proactively managing its \noperations to reduce environmental impacts while improving the quality \nof its products and the well-being of its employees and the community.  \nISB Environmental has implemented a programmatic approach to \ncompliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  All of \nthe business unit's manufacturing facilities will address process safety and \nrisk management issues for key materials utilized by the plants in \nmanufacturing fiberglass insulation products. The program will fulfill the \ngeneral duty clause requirement in the RMP rule.  Facilities, like Kansas \nCity, with threshold quantities above the RMP triggers, have utilized a \nmanagement manual system to comply with the requirements of RMP.  \nThis submittal only characterizes the subject processes that require a RMP \nsubmittal and certification by June 21, 1999.\n\nThe Kansas City plant holds Environmental Stewardship, along with \nSafety, Productivity, and Quality, as one of its (4) driving principles.  \nLocated in the Fairfax Industrial District for 52 years, the Kansas City \nplant is an integral part of the Kansas City, Kansas community.  \nMembership in such organizations as Friends of Fairfax and the \nWyandotte County Coalition for Chemical Safety emphasize the \nimportance with which the plant views their commitment.\n\n2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE \nPOLICIES\n\nOwens Corning is committed to developing and operating its \nmanufacturing facilities in a manner protective of the environment and \nhuman health.

      "SummaryText": "ens Corning is known \nfor, the Kansas City facility uses a 50% formaldehyde solution in the \nmanufacturing of fiberglass binder resin for use at the facility.  Because \nthis is a toxic chemical, numerous controls have been implemented to \nprevent an accidental release of this chemical.  In the event of a release, the \nKansas City facility has an emergency response program that will be \nimplemented.  This program is made up of hourly and management \nemployees who have been properly trained in certain elements of \nemergency response, as well as communication with the appropriate \nresponder organizations in the community.\n\n3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED PROCESSES\n\nThe Kansas City facility, located at 300 Sunshine Road in Kansas City, \nKansas, is a producer of wool glass fibers, which are fabricated into \ninsulation materials.  Glass fiber manufacturing involves the high-\ntemperature conversion of various materials into a homogeneous melt, \nfollowed by the fabrication of this melt into glass fibers.  After the \nformation of the glass fibers, a thermosetting chemical binder solution is \napplied to the fibers.  The glass fibers and binder solution are then \ncollected on a conveyor belt where they are sent through a large curing \noven and then through a cooling section.  The result is a mat that is then \ncut into batts or rolls of the desired dimensions and then packaged.\nKansas City Insulation plant has a single covered process that is subject to \nRMP.  The 50% formaldehyde solution that is utilized in a process to \nmanufacture the binder resin is a Program Level 3 process.  The \nformaldehyde resin is a binder system ingredient used to manufacture \nwool fiberglass insulation at the plant. \n\n4.0\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nOwens Corning has determined the distance to the toxic endpoints for the \nregulated substance present at the Kansas City facility.  The following \nrelease scenarios have been considered:\n\n50% Formaldehyde\t\n\nAqueous formaldehyde is stored in"

      "SummaryText": "two 15,000-gallon \nstorage tanks.  The tanks are located in a diked \ncontainment area.  Trucks unload the material \nthrough a 3-inch hose.  All truck unloading takes \nplace in a separate containment area designed for that \npurpose.  Both the storage tanks and the truck are \nmaintained at 150? F.  \n\nWorst-case release is an instantaneous release of the \nmaximum inventory of one tank, which forms a \nliquid pool in the dike.  The release duration is \nassumed to be 60-minutes because the concentration \nof formaldehyde in solution after 10-minutes of \nevaporation is not significantly lower than the initial \nconcentration.  \n\nDistance to Endpoint  -    0.456 miles  (ALOHA)\n\nThe alternative release involves a failure of the \nunloading hose during product delivery resulting in a \nrelease of 500 gallons over a 5-minute period.  The \nliquid released from the line/hose break is contained \nin the truck unloading area.\n\nDistance to Endpoint  -    0.116 miles  (ALOHA)\n\nThe release scenarios examined above could result in off-site impact.  Both \nOCA guidance look-up table values and air dispersion modeling results \nfor the toxic compounds via ALOHA were examined and reported as \nindicated.\n\n5.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/CHEMICAL-\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nMitigation measures were considered in formulating the alternative \nscenarios since unloading incidents are the most commonly occurring \naccident type. \n\nAccidental releases are mitigated by an aggressive spill reporting program \nand operator and Emergency Response Team training in spill response.\n\n6.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo documented off-site impacting accidents have occurred within the last \nfive years.\n\n7.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nKansas City maintains an up-to-date Emergency Response Plan and \nconducts annual drills to train on response procedures.
