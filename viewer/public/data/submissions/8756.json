This information includes\n          materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating\n          of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and\n          trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance\n          activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure\n          that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n          Process Hazard Analysis\n\n          MRD has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure\n          that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. \n          Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are\n          systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in\n          place to manage those hazards.\n\n          The refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique\n          to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most\n          systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are\n          conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as\n          engineering expertise.

These periodic\n          reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this\n          frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The PHA Team has considered\n          offsite effects of potential releases as part of all PHA updates completed after\n          August, 1996.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented\n          and retained.

Executive Summary\n\n     The Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, Michigan Refining Division (MRD) is committed\n     to operating in a manner that is safe for employees, contractors, the public and the\n     environment.  It is MRD's policy to conduct its operations in accordance with the highest\n     standards of environmental stewardship, employee and contractor safety and community\n     responsibility.   As part of this policy, MRD has established systems to help ensure safe\n     operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management\n     program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at MRD and that complies with the requirements\n     of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release\n     Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the\n     requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the\n     risk management program at MRD.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan\n     executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description\n     of the risk management program at MRD.\n\n     1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n          MRD has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the public, its employees and\n          contractors and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary element  of this\n          commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and\n          around the refinery.  MRD utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and\n          detailed procedures to reduce the probability of an accidental release.  \n\n          In the event of a release, the MRD has a well trained emergency resp"

Please recognize that none of these events\n          have occurred at our facility.  Also, for some of these events, MRD has emergency\n          mitigation systems to help reduce the consequences of the event if it occurred.  In all\n          cases, if such events occurred, MRD would actuate its emergency response plan to\n          respond to the event, notify local authorities and take appropriate actions to protect\n          both our employees and people in the community.\n\n          Worst-case Release Scenarios\n\n          Because MRD has no toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in  sufficient\n          quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, the risk management plan does not include\n          a worst-case scenario associated with toxic substances. \n    \n          The worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion, involving the full\n          inventory of the largest vessel containing butane. The analysis assumes that the\n          maximum possible inventory of 3,100,000 pounds is released, completely vaporizes,\n          and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Because there are some public\n          receptor locations just outside the refinery property, this event could affect members\n          of the public at those closest locations. \n\n          There are no Program 1 processes at the refinery.  Therefore, no additional worst-case analyses are reported for such processes.  Also, the refinery did not identify any\n          worst-case scenarios that would"

In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety\n          programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel\n          periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling\n          their safety obligations.\n\f          Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n\n          MRD conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility\n          modification that requires a change in the process safety information (not required\n          for replacement in kind).  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features,\n          procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior\n          to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to\n          make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all\n          supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review uses checklists to verify all\n          aspects of readiness.

MRD uses crude petroleum as its primary  feed material and\n          makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and\n          liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane. Many of these products are\n          flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are\n          present in the refinery process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000\n          pounds.  In total, MRD has 14 process units that are covered by the RMP rule\n          because of their flammable process materials.  These units are listed in the RMP data\n          included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\n\n          MRD has no toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in  sufficient quantity to be\n          covered by the RMP rule.\n     \n     1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n     \n          MRD performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an\n          accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the\n          environment.

An alternative release scenario represents a release\n          that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the refinery.
