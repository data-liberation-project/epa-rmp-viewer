Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n    United Dairy Farmers, Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.   We are also coordinated with the City of Erlanger Fire Department and the Kenton County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n    This facility is primarily used for warehouse storage and distribution of ice cream products.  The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 21,200 pounds.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3.      The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n    To evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the computer dispersion model ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) was u"

      "SummaryText": "tilized exclusively. ALOHA is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for this purpose. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n    The worst case scenario would involve the catastrophic failure of the high pressure receiver, which could hold the entire contents of the refrigeration system during an unforseen maintenance condition.  As specified in the RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the entire contents of the vessel (21,200 pounds) are assumed to be released over a period of 10 minutes, yielding a release rate of 2,120 pounds per minute.  Due to fact that the vessel is located outside, the release rate would be unmitigated.  Under worst case weather conditions (Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed) as required by the RMP rule, ALOHA yielded a distance of 1.6 miles to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm).  The majority of area within the zone of influence exhibits urban topography, based upon the prevalence of commercial, industrial, and residential buildings.  The estimated residential population for the zone of influence is approximately 19,000, based upon 1990 census data calculated by  LANDVIEW software.  Other public receptors identified include schools, a nursing home, and at least one recreational area.  No environmental receptors are known to be located within the zone of influence.\n\n    Several alternative release scenarios were evaluated, however, the majority either would not exceed the toxic endpoint or would not result in offsite consequences.  For example, one of the most \"likely\" release scenarios would involve an undetected release through a pressure relief valve on the facility roof.  Based upon the manufacturer's rating for this relief valve, it only has the capacity to release 29 pounds per minute of ammonia gas.  At this release rate under average weather conditions for this area, the toxic endpoint would not be exceeded according to ALOHA results.  \n\n    For"

      "SummaryText": " the purpose of this RMP submission, the following alternative release scenario was chosen, primarily because it is one of the few that would result in offsite consequences as required by the RMP rule.  The scenario would occur during routine maintenance operations at the unit cooler control valve group on the facility roof.  A maintenance worker would accidently trip and fall on a 3/4 inch liquid line, resulting in complete pipe rupture.  Due to the immediate presence of isolation valves, the release would be stopped within a one (1) minute timeframe.  Approximately 634 pounds of liquid ammonia would be released in this timeframe, based upon the modified bernoulli's equation for pipe liquid releases (page 4-14 of the  RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration).  Since the release would occur outside on the facility roof, the release rate would be unmitigated.  Under average weather conditions for area, ALOHA yielded a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.49 miles.  The majority of area within the zone of influence exhibits rural or open topography, with residences and industrial buildings being the only offsite receptors identified.  The estimated residential population for the zone of influence is approximately 1,300, based upon 1990 census data calculated by  LANDVIEW software.  \n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n    Our facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting  requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n    Process Safety Information\n\n    United Dairy Farmers, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equip"
