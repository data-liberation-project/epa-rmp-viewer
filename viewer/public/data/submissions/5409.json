      "SummaryText": "RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nThe City of Great Falls and its Public Works Department, which manages the Water Treatment Plant, take safety very seriously.  The City of Great Falls Safety Manual states that \"The City of Great Falls is committed to providing and ensuring a safe work environment for all employee, co-workers, and the public by conducting all operations as safely and efficiently as possible.  A comprehensive Safety and Loss Control Program can only be effective if everyone in the organization accepts their responsibility with accountability.\"  The Public Works Safety Committee meets monthly and is active in accident review and facility audits.  \n\nThe Great Falls Water Treatment Plant works with the Great Falls Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee in preparing for emergency response.  This preparation includes annual reporting of hazardous chemicals, annual inspections by Fire Dept. personnel and occasional training for responses to major chlorine release events.  The training sessions for response to chlorine leaks are a full scale excersize and take place at the Water Treatment Plant and similar facilities at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The latest training sessions have taken place in 1994 at the Water Treatment Plant and 1998 at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nTHE WATER TREATMENT PLANT REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Great Falls Water Treatment Plant is a conventional surface water treatment plant.  Treatment processes include coagulation, settling, filtration and disinfection, with ammonia added after disinfection to prolong a disinfectant residual in the distribution system.  The primary chemicals involved in the process are aluminum sulfate (a liquid coagulant), chlorine gas (to provide disinfection) and ammonia gas.  Chlorine is the only substance at the treatment plant in sufficient quantity to require regulation.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO\nThe EPA-defined worst case scenario is the discharge of the entire contents "

      "SummaryText": "of the largest container (one ton in this case) in ten minutes.  This, in conjunction with \"F\" atmosphperic stability, results in an affected area 1.3 miles around the Water Treatment Plant.  It is important to note that chlorine is a dense gas and will not travel up-hill toward the residential areas or the hospital located in the 1.3 mile area around the water treatment plant.\n\nALTERNATE CASE SCENARIO\nThe alternate case scenario involves an accident that would result in knocking a full chlorine cylinder out of its location while it is connected to the withdrawl header, and having it stop in a location that would result in liquid chlorine being discharged.  This would result in 240 pounds of chlorine per minute being discharge from the cylinder that was displaced and 75 pounds per minute of gaseous chlorine being discharged from the remaining five cylinders connected to the header.  The total release under this scenario is estimated to be 6,493 pounds (the cylinder discharging liquid chlorine would be empty in a little over eight minutes and training excerises indicate that it could take as long as 60 minutes to control a major event like this).  This scenario was chosen because it was the only conceivable case where the discharge of liquid chlorine could be involved.  This event, in conjunction with a more common \"D\" atmospheric stability, result in an affected area 4/10ths of a mile in radius.  It is important to note that the event that would trigger this scenario (dropping a cylinder) has never been experienced at this plant and is very unlikely.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\nThe Water Treatment Plant staff have developed a prevention program in compliance with EPA's Risk Management Program as well as OSHA'a Process Safety Management program.  In addition, safety training resulting from the Montana Department of Environmental Quality's oversight of the facility operation have been in place for years.  "

      "SummaryText": "All employees, contractors and anyone else that is at the facility for any length of time or will work around the chlorine system is fully informed of the hazards of chlorine, the operation of the alarm system (i.e. what certain alarms mean), and how to safely exit the facility.  As a result, there has never been a chlorine-related accident at the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAs a result of determining the alternate case scenario, the chlorine cylinders succeptible to the described event are now strapped into their location so they will not get knocked out of position.  Further, the City has budgeted for a qualified engineering firm to review the entire chlorine system and determine what can be done to improve safety.  This review will include changes in the equipment and the method of chlorine delivery (i.e. deliver the chlorine to the feed facility under vacuum rather than under pressure), substitute a different type of disinfectant for chlorine gas, and the installation of a scrubber to keep chlorine from escaping to the atmosphere.  This study is budgeted to begin in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1999."
