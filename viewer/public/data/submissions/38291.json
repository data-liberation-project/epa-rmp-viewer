Corporate Prevention  and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Publix Super Market, Inc. (Publix) Lakeland Facility is located at 3045 New Tampa Highway, Lakeland, Polk County, Florida.  Publix requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Publix ?s corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and environmental training services.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Publix Lakeland Facility is located south of Interstate I-4 in the western portion of the city of Lakeland, Polk County, Florida.  The facility consists of a milk and ice cream manufacturing plant, bakery facility, produce warehouse building, deli meats plant for distribution to the Publix Super Markets, and a new freezer building dedicated to frozen storage.\n\nThe Lakeland Facility has four separate ammonia refrigeration systems which all four exceed the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The four ammonia refrigeration systems' equipment is located in each of four machine or compressor rooms.  Each system has at least one high pressure receiver (HPR) associated with the system.  For the purposes of the worst-case analysis the largest capacity HPR vessel for the milk plant's ammonia refrigeration system was chosen because it is the largest high pressure vessel at the facility and is located outside.  The HPR is located outside of the machine room and has a capacity of 51,423 lbs. of ammonia, based on an 42% capacity fill limit.  Alternative-case scenarios for all four refrigeration processes were analyzed using the HPRs from the respective processes considering passive mitigation when appropriate as well as administrative limits on the con"

      "SummaryText": "tents of the vessels.  The HPR vessels at the new Freezer building and bakery?s are both inside the machine room for which the enclosure passive mitigation was applied.  \n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nThis facility?s four refrigeration systems exceed the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and are all therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places all four of the Lakeland Facility?s refrigeration processes in the Program 3 level.  The Lakeland Facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  Also, in 2001 Publix appointed an individual dedicated solely to the position of PSM Coordinator of the PRM programs at each of their facilities.\n\nThe Lakeland Facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was established in October 1994 for the three exisiting  ammonia processes. Prior to startup of the new Freezer ammonia process,  the PSM program was established in July 2001.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Lakeland Facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work "

      "SummaryText": "can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  The staff also has performed PHAs of these processes as required. Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Accident History\n\nThe Lakeland Facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years, that resulted in injuries, deaths, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Lakeland Facility has an Emergency Response Plan for Ammonia in place.  The site has internal emergency response capability and has developed a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the City of Lakeland?s Fire Department and the Polk County Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519."
