      "SummaryText": "Chemical Usage:\nThis facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to chill and preserve our citrus juice products.  The\nrefrigeration process used is totally enclosed preventing chemical leakage under normal operation.  Citrus juices arrive at this facility by tanker truck from fruit processing facilities in Florida and California.  Juice remains chilled in storage and then packaged into finished product and stored under refrigeration for eventual retail sale.\n\nChemical Safety Policies:\nWe have a proactive safety policy through employee involvement thus providing a safe environment for our employees and the surrounding local community.  We are proud of our past record of no reportable chemical releases or chemical related employee accidents during the past five years.  Through the application of an active process safety management program we continually endeavor to make improvements in system safety and emergency preparedness.  Key personnel are properly trained and equipped to respond to on site anhydrous ammonia releases.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\nA horizontal high-pressure receiver located outside of the main refrigeration compressor room was chosen as our predictable worst case chemical release scenario.  This vessel can contain 9,295 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia when 80 percent full.  Typically under normal operation the content is less than 3,000 pounds.  The worst case scenario for this process, as this submittal requires, assumes that the tank contents are fully released as a gas/vapor mixture over a ten-minute period.  Our model indicates an off site consequence can result.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario:\nThis scenario assumes a 3-inch Schedule 80 discharge pipe (inside diameter of 1.939 inches) from the same high-pressure receiver is accidentally broken off.  The full three-inch diameter pipe is than assumed to be releasing a gas/liquid mixture of anhydrous ammonia.  As the liquid escapes, the volume in the tank drops, resulting in more v"

The total release time was assumed to last the required ten minutes.  The computer modeling indicates an off site consequence can result.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nWorld Citrus West standard policy requires daily monitoring and inspections of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system by trained employees in accordance with OSHA and IIAR (International Institude of Ammonia Refrigeration) guidelines.  Necessary repairs to the refrigeration system are made in a prompt, safe manner.  In addition we perform preventive maintenance on critical system components.  Safety relief valves are replaced within the suggested five year cycle and required annual maintenance is performed on all compressors.  In addition, plant wide ammonia monitoring equipment is being installed to provide early warning if an ammonia release were to occur.\n\n5 Year Accidental History:\nWorld Citrus West has not had any accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.  No injuries have occured due to anhydrous ammonia.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nDuring normal workday operations, the facility emergency response plan consists of employee notification (alarm) and evacuation, followed by notification of the Fullerton Fire Department.  Maintenance and technical personnel have received hazardous material technician level training in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120(q) (iii).  A facility emergency plan has been prepared and disseminated to facility personnel.  Evacuation routes in case of an anhydrous ammonia release, are noted on the plan.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety:\nContinue reviewing and improving employee training and preventative maintenance programs.  Install plant wide ammonia sensing and monitoring systems to provide early warning of ammonia leaks.  Expand on the installation of ammonia sensors to all process areas where ammonia systems are located.  Im"
