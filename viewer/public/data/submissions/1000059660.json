Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nIn preparation for submittal of this RMP, SSPWD has completed installation of the following changes to improve safety, make the site more sustainable and inherently safer:\n\n - SSPWD has discontinued the use of Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) as a raw material. (HF is a regulated toxic material.)\n\n - SSPWD, as a result of the discontinuation of HF, produces a significantly less amount of anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride (aHCl) in-situ to the process.  (aHCl is a regulated toxic material.)\n\n - SSPWD has discontinued the use of Vinylidene Chloride (VDC) as a raw material. (VDC is a regulated toxic material.)\n\n\n\n\n\nSSPWD will continue to incorporate the findings from incident investigations, inherently safer technology reviews, and the recommendations developed during process hazard analysis as a means of continuously improving the safety at the West Deptford facility.\n\n"
