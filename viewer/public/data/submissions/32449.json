At 85% capacity, the maximum liquid\n\nchlorine inventory in each tank is 52,000 lbs.

Maximum liquid ammonia \n\ninventory in each tank is 85% of tank water volume of 2,000 gallons.  By\n\nassuming an ammonia density of 42.5 lb/ft3, the ammonia volume for one tank\n\nis converted to a mass of 9,700 lbs. with the exclusion of negligible \n\nquantities in the piping.

The Offsite consequence analysis modeling was \n\nperformed based on the following principle elements:\n\n\n\nA.   Meteorological parameters for the dispersion modeling analysis\n\n     were determined using National Weather Service data collected at\n\n     the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.  Highest daily\n\n     maximum temperature and average relative humidity over the last\n\n     three-year period were used for worst-case scenarios.  Typical\n\n     meteorological conditions based on the data over the last \n\n     three-year period were used for alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\nB.   Total quantity in the single largest tank was used for chlorine\n\n     and ammonia worst-case scenarios.  A leak from a liquid line near\n\n     the outdoor storage tank was assumed for either chlorine or\n\n     ammonia alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nC.
