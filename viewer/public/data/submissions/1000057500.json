The products produced utilizing the substances subject to the RMP regulations include Aerosol Cleaners, and Aerosol Paints & Coatings.  Additionally, LHB manufactures and packages Liquid Cleaners, Latex Paints, Tree Marking Paint for the US Forrest Service, Maintenance Products including lubricants and corrosion preventive compounds and air fresheners.  \n\n\n\nAerosol manufacturing is a partially automated system that consists of filling a can with paint concentrate and solvent, crimping a spray valve on the can and adding propellant to pressurize the can. The cans are tested, labeled, capped, and prepared for shipment.\n\n\n\nPaint concentrates and other concentrates are stored in 55-gallon drums or Intermediate bulk containers (330 gallon), inside the production building. Concentrates are stirred in the mix room and are pumped into the aerosol filling lines. Paints to be repackaged are stirred and pumped into the liquid filling lines.\n\n\n\nSolvents are stored in above ground storage tanks located outside. Propellants are stored outside, at vapor pressure, in cylindrical tanks. Paints, solvents, and propellants are hazardous substances as defined by OSHA PSM. However, only propellants are regulated by EPA's RMP program. Propellants on the EPA list are flammables and include propane, butane, dimethyl ether and 1,1-difluoroethane. Inventory of each substance exceeds EPA's threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nLHB Industries management team has many years experience in chemical and aerosol industries and are committed to providing the safest possible work environment for our employees. All operations are run to maximize safety and minimize the risk of any chemical exposures to employees and the environment.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nLHB Industries has had no accidental releases, associated injuries or precautionary evacuations.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIn addi"

PSM is Prevention Program 3 of RMP in 40 CFR Part 68 and identifies the effort needed to minimize the potential for an unplanned release of the flammables and prevent accidents. LHB has a PSM program in place. Our greatest strengths lie with our maintenance and inspection programs and the simplicity of our processes.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS \n\n\n\nLHB Industries utilize a What-if to perform its PHA.  No action items were determined during our most recent PHA in June of 2021.    \n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE, CONTRACTOR SAFETY and HOT WORK PERMITS:\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned one of our strengths is the simplicity of our processes.  This simplicity allows us to minimize operational changes, the use of contractors, and/or the need for hot work permits.  Therefore LHB has not found it necessary to review or revise our Hot Work Permit Procedures, contractor safety procedures or evaluate contractor safety performance.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nDesignated employees of LHB are trained to respond to only minor incidents that may occur at the facility. Minor incidents include small flash fires from a single aerosol can, cardboard, or small amount of solvent or propellant. All untrained personnel will evacuate the area during a minor incident and all personnel will evacuate in case of a major incident. The Berkeley Fire Department will be called to respond in any fire situation.\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan is in place that meets the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe facility works with Berkeley Fire Department and LEPC to ensure that they are well informed about the nature of our operation and the material utilized at the facility.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR IMPROVED SAFETY\n\n\n\nLHB Industries continues to coordinate with the Berkeley Fire Department.  We also review readily available information from OSHA, EPA, and the Chemical Safety Board.  We strive to apply lessons from our facilities as well as other sim"
