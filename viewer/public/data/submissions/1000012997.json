      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nThe Town of Culpeper operates a Water Treatment Facility (WTF) for treatment of raw water for consumption. The WTF must comply with the Program 3 Risk Management Program (RMP), under Section 112[r] of the Clean Air Act.  Chlorine is managed in one-ton cylinders in total quantities that exceed threshold limits established under the RMP rule.  \n\nChemical Processes and Safety Equipment\nWater Treatment Facility\nThe Town of Culpeper uses a vacuum system for dispensing chlorine.  The chlorine gas is under vacuum from the switchover-type vacuum regulators mounted on the chlorine ton containers.  The regulators control the flow of chlorine gas and automatically switch to a new gas supply when the online gas supply runs out.  Chorine gas is fed to the raw water supply via three chlorinators.  The amount of chlorine gas dispensed is also monitored via Chlor-scale model 12D80 hydraulic load cell scales.\n\nThe chlorine ton containers are stored in the Chlorine Storage room.  The Chlorine Storage room is equipped with fume exhaust fans and fresh air louvers.  Additionally, the Chlorine Storage room and the Chlorinator Room are both equipped with dual concentration alarms.  Battery back up is provided.  Employees utilize two Allegro\u00c2\u00ae full-faced forced air respirators during chlorine cylinder changing operations.  The facility also maintains ten-minute emergency air bags for employee and visitor use in the event of a chlorine leak.  A generator is available in the event of a loss of power at the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Plan\nThe primary component of the RMP is a detailed Program 3 Prevention Plan, which is derived from the Operations and Maintenance Manual (O&M), inclusive of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).  The Prevention Plan was designed to limit to the extent possible the potential for an accidental release based upon the following key elements:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7\tEmployment of experienced and highly trained personnel.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tContinued training of personnel in general chlorine fi"

Predictive release information was modeled using EPA's RMP*Comp\u00c2\u00bf model to identify the distance to endpoint for a potential chlorine release.  LandView5\u00c2\u00bf was used to estimate the population for the modeled endpoint distances.\n\nThe worst-case scenario involves a failure or rupture of a one-ton-cylinder outside of the Chlorine Storage Room releasing the entire 2,000 pound contents of the cylinder in a ten minute period.  The distance to endpoint was estimated to be 1.3 miles from the facility assuming a wind speed of 3.4 miles/hour and an atmospheric stability class F.  The potential population affected by the worst-case scenario was estimated to be 4,820 people.\n\nThe first alternate release scenario involves a potential cylinder rupture where 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas may be discharged during a ten minute accidental release.  The distance to the endpoint was estimated to be 0.2 miles from the facility assuming a wind speed of 6.7 miles/hour and an atmospheric class D.  The endpoint determination includes enclosure of the cylinder within the storage room.  The potential population affected by the first alternate release scenario was estimated to"

The scenario assumes a 45 minute release duration (HAZMAT response time) and a 37.3 pounds per minute release rate.  The distance to endpoint was estimated to be 0.1 miles from the facility assuming a wind speed of 6.7 miles/hour and a atmospheric class D.  The endpoint determination includes enclosure of the cylinder within the storage room.  The potential population affected by the second alternate release scanario was estimated to be 25 people.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Town of Culpeper involved the local emergency response council in the preparation of the RMP in order to optimize response to potential major releases, and optimize release prevention by the facility operators.  Additionally, an emergency response program has been prepared for the facility which outlines the procedures and lines of communication that are necessary to effectively respond to and mitigate a potential chemical release.  This information is also shared with the Culpeper Joint LEPC.  \n\nThe Water Treatment Facility's emergency response program includes procedures for notifying the FEMA's national incident management system, the Culpeper Joint LEPC, local hazardous materials (HAZMAT) teams in the event of a chlorine release.  Written procedures for evacuating the facility are also posted at the facility as well as documentation of two possible evacuation sites.  Currently, the responding HAZMAT team is the City of Fredericksburg Fire Department.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nNo accidental releases have occured at the Town of Culpeper Water Treatment Facility."
