The toxic end point is 2.6 miles using no administrative controls or mitigation factors for limiting releases and would effect offsite receptors.\n\nOur Alternate Release Scenario is a 317-lb release of chlorine gas through a valve body opening of a 1-ton container located on our urban site.  This release rate is 10.5 lb/min for a 60-min duration.  The toxic end point distance is 0.48 miles using no administrative controls or mitigation factors for limiting releases and would effect offsite receptors.\n\nBatesville Water Utility WTP has not had an accidental chlorine release in the past five years from our covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nBWU WTP will, through any incident investigations, hazard reviews or regulation changes continue to update safe operating procedures, employee response training and process equipment maintenance."
