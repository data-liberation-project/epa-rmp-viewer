Davidson WWTP Executive Summary\n\nThe City of Huntsville continues to implement a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its N. B. Davidson Facility at 1859 Camellia in Huntsville, Texas.  Generally, this is achieved through adequate training of employees, maintenance of facilities and process equipment, and provision of suitable safety equipment.  City administration continually seeks to improve the safety measures that protect its employees and citizens alike.  \n\nOne ton cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used in the disinfection and dechlorination processes after biological wastewater treatment prior to discharge into the San Jacinto River Basin.  8,000 pounds each of chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored at N. B. Davidson WWTP. There have been no chlorine or sulfur dioxide incidents or accidents at this facility.\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of a potential release, the City of Huntsville has incorporated the following general accidental release prevention program and chlorine/sulfur dioxide specific prevention steps:\n\nA?    Maintenance staff shall conduct routine preventative maintenance of key process components.\nA?    Employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Lockout/Tag-out procedures.\nA?    The City of Huntsville shall maintain a routine inspection schedule.\nA?    Employees shall be trained on the operation and maintenance of all the chlorine and sulfur dioxide facilities.\nA?    Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all chlorine and sulfur dioxide operations and maintenance shall be adhered to.\nA?    Only those persons trained in chlorine safety shall be present during any work that could produce a release.\n\n\nThe City of HuntsvilleA?s emergency response program uses the Huntsville Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team.  It focuses on keeping employees away from dangerous areas, while the Fire Department responds to and controls the chemical release.  When an employee obse"
