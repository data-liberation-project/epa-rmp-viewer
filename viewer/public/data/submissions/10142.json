Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at United Farmers Co-op in Klossner are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the New Ulm Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Klossner (ammonia, Figure 1).  The\nmaximum amount stored is 15,300 gallons (78,734 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85 %.\n\nWe also have propane stored in a 12,000-gallon tank located at our facility in Klossner (propane,\nFigure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 10,200 gallons (43,075 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n            3.1     Ammonia\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (78,734 p"

At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.2 miles (ammonia, Figure 2).  The estimated population within\na 4.2-mile radius of this facility is 13,000.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The\nscenario involves the release of 11,993.74 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of\n30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (ammonia, Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile\nradius of the facility is 100.\n\n            3.2     Propane\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the propane\nstorage tank (43,075 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric\nstability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.28\nmiles (propane, Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of houses and\ncan result in serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated population within a 0.28-\nmile radius of this facility is 100.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral\nweather conditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.14 mile\n(propane, Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.14-mile radius of this facility is 50.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safe"

Any non-compliance issue\ndiscovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nUnited Farmers Co-op truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a\nteam effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning\naccident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access\nto all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly\ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nUnited Farmers Co-op has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5\nyears.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this\nperiod.\n\n  6. Emergency Response Plan\nUnited Farmers Co-op maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases\nof hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and\nmedical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the\npublic."
