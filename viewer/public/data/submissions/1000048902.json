The produced NGL meets the criteria for classification as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) by the State of Ohio.  Therefore, the NGL storage and trucking loading facilities have been designed per Ohio State Fire Code 1301:7-7-38 and NFPA-58.\r\nIf an emergency should occur, it is our policy to notify the Marietta Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our employees are trained in the use of portable fire extinguishers for the extinguishment of fires at the incipient stage.\r\n\r\nDescription of facility and the regulated substances handled:  The Crude Oil Stabilization unit is designed to reduce the Reid vapor pressure of unstabilized crude oil.  The stabilized crude oil product can be safely shipped via barge while the resultant NGL will be compressed, condensed, and stored in two new 90,000 gallon bullets.  A new NGL truck loading facility is included in this new operating facility.\r\nThe facility is manned 24 hours per day and the control system utilizes PLC's for control of the safety system and the process.  The system is designed fail safe with process interruption, fire & gas detection, and emergency shutdown.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The NGL system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\r\nThe accident prevention program elements include Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Operator and Maintenance Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Emergency Planning and"

      "SummaryText": "Response, Incident Investigation, an Employee Participation Plan, Contractor Safety Evaluation and Orientation, and Safe Work Practice Procedures.\r\nThe Process Safety Information is an assemblage of equipment design specifications, process technology knowledge, and chemical hazard information.  This reference material includes Piping and Instrumentation Drawings (P&ID's), materials of construction, and design codes and engineering standards.\r\nThe Process Safety Information is used to perform a Process Hazard Analysis which studies any potential safety consequences resulting from process deviations and the adequacy of the installed safeguards.\r\nOperating Procedures have been developed to guide the various phases of unit operation as well as safe work practices.  The procedures contain action steps, process conditions, personnel responsibilities, safe operating limits, and how to respond to upsets.\r\nTraining is one of the most critical elements of risk management.  Requirements for operating personnel include: initial training on the process, procedures, hazards and safe work practices, and refresher training at least every three years.  All employees receive basic training consisting of an overview of the process and the hazards present.\r\nThe Mechanical Integrity element helps to assure that the condition of critical equipment is monitored, maintained, and documented.  Ergon utilizes a computerized maintenance management system to help organize mechanical integrity activities and records.  Regularly scheduled inspection and preventative maintenance intervals comply with applicable codes and good engineering practice.\r\nNumerous industrial incidents have been caused by unauthorized or inappropriate changes to equipment.  The Marietta Terminal follows a Management of Change (MOC) procedure where additions, deletions, or modifications undergo thorough review.  The MOC procedure documents the basis and scope of the change, the effect on hazards, updates to Process Safety"

      "SummaryText": "Information, Procedures, and Training.\r\nThe Emergency Planning and Response element addresses what to do in the event of an incident.  The emergency action plan includes reporting an emergency, evacuation routes, and accounting for personnel.\r\nRegardless of the prevention program, incidents and near misses may not always be prevented.  The Incident Investigation element addresses the need to learn from these events and help to prevent similar events in the future.  An investigation covers the details of the incident, key contributing factors and recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence.\r\nEmployee Participation is an element that is integrally linked to all of the other elements.  Employee participation is a core part of our business strategy.  Employees are involved in documenting process safety information, conducting hazard analysis, writing and reviewing procedures, conducting training, managing change, investigating incidents, and assuring safe work practices are followed.\r\n\r\nThe five-year accident history:  This is a new operation for the handling of liquefied petroleum gas.  However, this facility has handled and continues to handle crude oil.  Ergon has never had an accident at this facility that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving the liquefied petroleum gas system, it is our policy to notify the Marietta Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We train our employees in the use of portable fire extinguishers and to respond to fires in the incipient stage to prevent a more severe emergency.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  This is a new process and Ergon has used the methods suggested by OSHA's PSM standard to reduce the likelihood of an accident involving flammable hydrocarbons.  We will continue to review the operation and make improvements where appropriate to further improve safety."
