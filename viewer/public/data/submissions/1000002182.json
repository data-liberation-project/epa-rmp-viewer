The Facility Policy.\n\nThe Owners, management and employees of SPADE COOP GIN in Anton, Texas are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.    Facility Information. \n\n \nA?    The facility stores anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer for sale to farmer customers\nA?    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\nA?    The maximum quantity stored would be 280,392pounds.  Stored a 30,000 gallon storage tank, two 11,000 gallon tanks and one 8000 gallon tank..\nA?    \n\n3.    The Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\na)    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,196 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.16 miles.\nb)    The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a pipe leak.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\n4.    The accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of A?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-611.1A? published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR 1910.111, A?storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.A?\n\n5.    The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\na)    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the fac"

The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Facility has:\n\na)    A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\nb)    Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nc)    A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.210, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. As a result of our efforts to improve the satety of our facility we have installed Squib-Taylor break-a-ways on our loading risers to prevent releases if a nurse tank leaves the filling process prior to disconnecting from the filling hose.  These break-a-ways allow the shut down at the riser valve and the end of the loading hose. Our delivery lines have also been placed underground from the storage tank. \n\nThere are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
