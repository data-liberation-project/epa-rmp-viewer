Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. As a result of our efforts to improve the satety of our facility we have installed Squib-Taylor break-a-ways on our loading risers to prevent releases if a nurse tank leaves the filling process prior to disconnecting from the filling hose.  These break-a-ways allow the shut down at the riser valve and the end of the loading hose. Our delivery lines have also been placed underground from the storage tank. \n\nThere are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
