      "SummaryText": "1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared and implemented for the Aerosol Packaging Facility (APF) to comply with the Chemical Accident Prevention rule issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act.  This rule is found at 40 CFR 68 and is intended to prevent chemical accidents that could endanger the public and/or the environment.  Since more than 10,000 pounds of a mixture of propane and butane gas is stored at the APF and given that the APF is not a retail facility, the rule applies.  The following subsections highlight the important features of the plan.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is DPT policy that facilities and personnel will comply with all applicable regulations and laws to prevent accidental releases.  The facility is designed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and all applicable codes and laws.  In the event of a fire, explosion, or other emergency situation, DPT personnel will respond in accordance with written procedures and training and will contact the San Antonio Fire Department for emergency response.\n\n1.2  Facility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe APF stores a 58% propane 43% butane mixture in an outdoor 9,200 gallon bulk storage tank.  Gas from the storage tank is piped indoors to the aerosol packaging operation where it is dispensed into spray cans.\n\n1.3  Worst Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario is catastrophic bulk tank failure when filled to capacity, resulting in an explosion and fire.  Public receptors are located within the theoretical 0.3 mile (1,584 foot) 1psi overpressure radius.  An alternate release scenario is the rupture of piping carrying the gas, leading to a 10 minute release and an explosion. Public receptors are located within the theoretical 0.2 mile (1,056 foot) 1psi overpressure radius.  \n\n1.4  Release Prevention Program\n\nThe APF was designed, constructed, and is maintained in accordanc"

      "SummaryText": "e with all applicable laws, codes, and regulations.  DPT operating personnel are familiar with the provisions of this and other written release prevention and emergency response procedures for the APF.\n\n1.5  Five-year Accident History\n\nThis is a new facility.  No accidents involving propane have occurred and no property damage, environmental impact, or injuries have resulted.\n\n1.6  Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of a flammable gas related emergency at the APF, the San Antonio Fire Department will be contacted for emergency response.  At this time, DPT does not maintain a fire brigade.\n\n1.7  Planned Safety Improvements\n\nGiven that this is a new facility, no additional safety improvements are planned at this time.  This RMP will be periodically reviewed and updated over the life of the facility."
