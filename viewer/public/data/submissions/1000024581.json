      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nTrenton Agri Products, LLC\r\n\r\nTrenton Agri Products, LLC (TAP) is an existing ethanol facility located in Hitchcock County, Nebraska.  TAP began operations at the ethanol plant in March 2004. The reports and information are an established part of TAP's procedures and much of the training has been ongoing.  Given that TAP is an existing facility, there have been periodic reviews and revisions to reports and information maintained at the facility to date.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\r\n\r\nTAP has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nTAP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire could be quickly extinguished.  TAP has coordinated with the Trenton Volunteer Fire Department/Hitchcock County Sheriff for emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nTAP participated in a Full Scale Exercise with the Southwest Planning, Exercising, and Training Region on August 21, 2010, funded in part by the U.S. DHS, Hitchcock County, and TAP.  The purpose of the exercise was to bring together the hospitals, EMS, fire, law enforcement, public sector and emergency management agencies that would have responsibility in responding to a mass casualty event.  TAP has a final After Action Report detailing the exercise onsite for review by EPA during normal business hours.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulate"

      "SummaryText": "d Substances:\r\n\r\nThe TAP ethanol plant is located on U.S. Highway 34, two (2) miles northeast of Trenton, Hitchcock County, Nebraska.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture.  TAP has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 2.34 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  The worst case radius of impact for denaturant is about 0.5 mile.\r\n\r\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 97,200 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic vapor cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 2.34 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors and two environmental receptors are located within this 2.34 mile radius.  The worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 560,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explsion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from entire denaturant tank.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 mile from the center of the facility.  Public receptors are also located within the 0.5 mile radius.\r\n\r\nAlthough TAP has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating worst case scenarios.\r\n\r\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Process Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\r\n\r\nSince the facility also qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were required.  The ARS is the release of 43,680 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud fire.  The A"

      "SummaryText": "RS endpoint is approximately 0.2 mile from the center of the facility.  The ARS is also the toxic release of 3,563 pounds per minute (equaling a total of 7,127 pounds) of ammonia.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.92 mile from the center of the facility.  There are public receptors within the 0.92 and 0.2 mile radius' that would be affected by these alternative release scenarios.\r\n\r\nAll population data was retreived from the LandView 6 software program.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 2010 a sample valve was accidentally left open on the 200 Proof Ethanol tank, as a result 200 Proof ethanol spilled into the tank farm containment structure.  In addition, the manual overflow valve was left open in the tank farm berm allowing the spilled ethanol to be released to the environment.  TAP reported the release in accordance with Nebraska guidelines and the contaminated water was sequestered to allow the ethanol to dissipate out of the water. Ethanol is not a reportable chemical for RMP purposes and therefore was not claimed on the Accident History portion of this RMP.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nTAP has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC Plan has been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\r\n\r\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  TAP's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nTAP will continue to provide training programs to ensure the safety of employees, contractors, and the general public."
