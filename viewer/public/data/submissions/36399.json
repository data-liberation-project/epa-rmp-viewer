Should an accidental release occur, our facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n     The primary activities at our facility are the storage of anhydrous ammonia to be resold as nitrogen fertilizer for crop production.  \n     Our anhydrous ammonia storage tank and plant is located 1 mile South of the city of Canby, MN on Hwy 75.\n     At this location we have one 30,000-gallon storage tank and one 26,000-gallon storage tank and 47-1,000 gallon nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia in storage would be 474,100 pounds in nurse tanks and the storage tanks.   \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank of anhydrous ammonia in 10 minutes time with maximum quantity release being 154,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.09 miles.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario:     \n     The alternative release scenario is based on a most likely potential incident in which a release from a break in a three inch line with duration of two minutes.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles. \n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n     This facility has implemented the rules and provisions of Minnesota Code of Agency Rules, \u00bfStorage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\u00bf, 1513.0010-1513.1100.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History:  \n     There"

We have provided the state and local authorities with the emergency planning and Community Right-to-Know information as required under SARA Title (EPCRA) MN Section 312 Tier II. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n     Safety at Farmers Coop Assn. Facilities is an on-going process, with assessments and evaluations performed periodically by organizations such as RCI to determine unsafe conditions and needed maintenance.  At this time there are no additional specific recommendations planned for implementation at our anhydrous ammonia facility."
