      "SummaryText": "The safety function at IRC Group, Inc. (IRC) facilities resides at the Vice president level of management.  The company has maintained diverse asphalt distribution and application operations at multiple facilities since its founding in 1925.  IRC operates two asphalt terminals on the Illinois River; one in Meredosia, Illinois and the other in Utica, Illinois.  The Meredosia Terminal also has an aqueous ammonia production plant.  A corporate Safety Program covering OSHA / DOT / EPA standard applicable to various operations is reviewed annually by upper management and by selected facility personnel.  Standard Operating Procedures are written for most job tasks associated with material handling, operations, and waste management.  A Corporate Safety Committee is comprised of individuals from each of the terminals.\nAsphalt is off-loaded from barges at the terminal's river dock and transported through heated piping to heated storage tanks at the terminal.  From the storage tanks, asphalt is loaded onto trailers for distribution to client locations or to asphalt road construction project sites.  Approximately 20,000 barrels (7,140,000 pounds) of asphalt is off-loaded, stored, and handled at the terminal annually.\nThe Meredosia Terminal has a Facility Response Plan for land-based operations and a Vessel Response Plan for water-based operations under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90).\n\nProcess 1:\nIn the first ammonia-related process, anhydrous ammonia is loaded onto IRC trailers from storage tanks at a nearby off-site terminal on the Illinois River.  The anhydrous ammonia may be off-loaded into temporary storage in a containment tank at Meredosia Terminal, or may be off-loaded into aqueous manufacturing tanks at the terminal.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia present during normal operating conditions is 41,000 pounds (8,000 gallons).\n\nProcess 2:\nThe second ammonia-related process is handled in the Ammonia Production and Handling Plant (APHP) is a separate and dedicated "

      "SummaryText": "area of Meredosia Terminal.  Two food-grade aqueous products are produced in the process, 19% and 29%.  The product solutions are loaded onto DOT-approved trailers for delivery to client locations.  Equipment and vehicular traffic associated with asphalt storage and distribution resides in an area of the terminal separate from ammonia operations.  The secondary containment capacity for the APHP (Facility Containment Area #1) is 556,025 gallons.  The APHP is covered by the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management standard.  The amount of aqueous ammonia during normal operating conditions is 729,000 gallons (5,540,400 pounds), and the maximum amount stored at the facility is 972,000 gallons (7,387,200 pounds).\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia in the past five years.    \n\nProcedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia:\nProcedures are in place for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance.  Procedures have been written for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.  All employees have been trained in relevant emergency response procedures and are informed of changes.  Procedures are reviewed and updated annually, and as appropriate to reflect process or equipment changes.  Procedures include; proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the community emergency response plan of the Pike County LEPC.\n\nTraining includes an annual HAZWOPER (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) 8-hour refresher class.  This class reviews ammonia safety and asphalt handling safety in addition to standard fire, spill, and release emergency response topics. The 18-minute video \"Handling Anhydrous Ammonia Safely\" is shown.  Training materials from the Asphalt Institute are used for asph"
