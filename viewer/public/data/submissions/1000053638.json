Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\r\n\r\nThe St. Johns River Power Park (SJRPP) is co-owned by JEA and Florida Power and Light Company.  The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plant Manager retains ultimate responsibility for these procedures, while specific duties are delegated to other employees.\r\n\r\nB. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe SJRPP is a two-unit power generation plant located at 11201 New Berlin Road, northeast of downtown Jacksonville, Florida, two miles north of the I-295 East Loop and Hecksher Drive intersection.  SJRPP has installed an anhydrous ammonia supply process for the selective catalytic reduction system (SCR) and the SO3 Control process.\r\n\r\nSJRPP has a anhydrous ammonia supply process which includes two storage tanks with a capacity of 360,000 lbs. each, administratively controlled to 290,000 lbs. (80% of vessel capacity).  The sum of these tanks (580,000 lbs.) exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The tanks store the ammonia as a gas liquefied under pressure.  Operating pressure varies but is typically around 130 psig.  Vaporizers maintain the desired pressure and temperature of the ammonia as delivered to the SCR ammonia injection grid and the SO3 control process.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that SJRPP used to have a Makeup Water Chlorination process before however SJRPP no longer uses the chlorination process and have removed all chlorine containers from on-site. \r\n\r\nC. Description of Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nSince the anhydrous ammonia process at SJRPP exceed the chemical threshold quantities for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, it is therefore subject to the PSM requiremen"

      "SummaryText": "ts.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places SJRPP ammonia process in the Program 3 level.  The SJRPP facility will use its existing PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  \r\n\r\nThe SJRPP has a program in place to comply with the PSM Standard.   The original PSM Program was reviewed and updated in conjunction with the ammonia process installation.  The PSM Program includes written operating procedures for the ammonia process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the  ammonia process to ensure consistency of operation and to minimize human error.  The PSM Program also includes a preventative maintenance plan, which requires all  ammonia equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will reduce the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Safe work practices, such as Lockout/tagout and Hot Work Permit, have long been required by the SJRPP Safety/Security Department.  These were reviewed and updated to ensure that non-routine work performed on the ammonia processes is addressed in the procedures.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the collection and review of all equipment information and the development of updated Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  These actions will help to ensure that the equipment meets the appropriate ammonia industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  The staff has performed initial PHA of the Ammonia process in January 2008 and revalidation PHA in 2013.\r\n\r\nD. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe SJRPP has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the last five years.\r\n\r\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe SJRPP has an Emergency Evacuation Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site has a procedure for ammonia releases which has been prepared and was impleme"
