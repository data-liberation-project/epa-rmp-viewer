We are committed to\noperating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and\nresponsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we\ninvest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the American\nChemistry Council, we adhere to the principles of\nResponsible Care.  In addition to ensuring that our\nemployees have the best training in the operation of our\nprocesses, we demand that safety be the first priority in\nthe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\nprocesses.\n\n     We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs\nthat help ensure site integrity.  Our policy is to implement\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances.  Examples of controls to prevent\nreleases include (1) installation of pressure relief valves\nto prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, (2)\nroutine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure\nvessels and piping are in good condition, (3) using\nmaterials of construction that are compatible with the\nprocess chemistry, (4) vessel pressure and temperature are\ncontinuously monitored and (5) use of carbon and water\nscrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions.\n     \n     However, should a release occur, trained personnel will\nrespond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation\nmeasures that have been included in our design include\ninstallation of isolation valves, fire suppression systems\nin areas where flammable chemicals are present and fire\nfighting equipment in all process areas, a fully implemented\nemergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an alarm system\nfor early notification of a release.

Following is a brief description of the\nfacility and the RMP regulated chemicals at the site.\n\n     The Columbus plant is situated on a 31 acre site that\nalso includes a Technical Center.  The site has four covered\nchemicals.   All processes are subject to Program Level 3.\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\n     EPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that companies\nprovide information about two types of offsite consequence\nanalysis scenarios:  worst-case scenarios and alternative\nrelease scenarios.  There are strict requirements for\nchoosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a\nresult, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative\nand represent a situation that is quite unlikely to occur.\nThe purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to\nprovide emergency planners with more information about the\nchemicals we handle and their relative hazards.  The\nalternative release scenarios are more realistic than worst-\ncase scenarios and could possibly occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n     We take a systematic, proactive approach to p"

Employees are routinely asked to participate in\r\nPHA's, incident investigations, management of change hazard\r\nanalyses and all other aspects of the prevention program.\r\nEmployees have access to all information developed as part\r\nof the prevention program and are specifically informed of\r\nany changes that occur in their process areas.  The various\r\nways employees are involved in the prevention program are\r\ndocumented in a written plan.\r\n\r\n     SAFE WORK PRACTICES\r\n\r\n     The Columbus plant has established safe work practices\r\nthat ensure the safety of our employees.  Examples of these\r\nprocedures include (1) hot work permits designed to control\r\nspark or flame producing activities, (2) a permit and\r\nprocedure to control confined space entry and (3) a\r\nlockout/tagout procedure for"

      "SummaryText": "prevention program, the Columbus plant has\r\nsafety features built into the design of our facility that\r\nhelp to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the\r\npublic and the environment.  These features may contain or\r\ncontrol a release, detect a release or reduce the\r\nconsequences of a release.  They may also prevent a release\r\nby providing strict design standards for process equipment.\r\nThe following types of safety features are used in various\r\nprocesses in our facility:\r\n  Release detection\r\n  -    Procedures require that a plan employee be present\r\n     during loading and unloading operations\r\n  Release Containment and Control\r\n  -    Valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n-    Automated notification systems for some process\r\nparameters, (e.g., high level, high pressure)\r\n-    Manual shutdown systems located in the control room\r\n-    Diked areas designed to contain a release and prevent\r\nits spread\r\n-    Pressure relief valves and rupture disks that discharge\r\nsafely to emissions control devices or the atmosphere\r\n  Release Mitigation\r\n  -    Fire suppression equipment\r\n-    Trained emergency response personnel\r\n-    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)- protective\r\nclothing, self-contained breathing apparatus\r\n-    Spill clean up equipment\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\n     Our five year accident history shows that we have had\r\nno accidental releases of covered chemicals at our facility.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\n     The Kemira Chemicals, Inc. Columbus plant maintains a\r\nwritten emergency response plan that is designed to protect\r\nemployees, the public and the environment.  The procedures\r\ninclude all aspects of emergency response, including proper\r\nfirst-aid and other medical procedures, the use of emergency\r\nequipment, the use of personal protective equipment,\r\nevacuation plans and community emergency response\r\nnotification procedures.  Procedures for maintaining\r\nemergency response equipment are also contained in the\r\nemergency respons"

      "SummaryText": "e plan.  There are procedures that address\r\nmaintaining, inspecting, testing and using the critical\r\nequipment needed in an emergency.  Employees receive\r\nperiodic training in the duties they are expected to perform\r\nduring an emergency and any change in the emergency response\r\nplan is administered through the management of change\r\nprocess so that affected employees are notified.\r\n\r\n     The emergency response plan is coordinated with local\r\nemergency responders (e.g., the fire department).  This\r\nincludes periodic meetings with community responders so that\r\nthey are aware of the hazards of our processes.\r\nCommunication channels with local responders are kept open\r\n24 hours per day.  This coordination and communication\r\nensures that the public is quickly notified, if necessary,\r\nand that action is promptly taken to minimize the\r\nconsequences of a release.  We periodically conduct\r\nemergency response drills so that all participants are\r\nfamiliar with their duties during an emergency.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\n     The Columbus plant continuously strives to improve the\r\nsafety of our processes.  Suggestions for improving safety\r\nare regularly addressed through process hazard analyses,\r\nmanagement of change procedures, incident investigations and\r\nemployee suggestions."
