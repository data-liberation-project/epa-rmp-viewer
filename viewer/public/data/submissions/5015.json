The TSDF may be subject to these provisions because it is possible that threshold quantities of several specific regulated toxic and/or flammable liquids may be present in greater than threshold quantities.  Under most circumstances Clean Harbors' records indicate that regulated substances are present in concentrations below 1% and/or in less than the threshold quantities specified in the ARP regulation.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) which is prepared under the EPA's predictive filing provisions has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The RMP certifies that Clean Harbors of Connecticut, Inc. has instituted a Risk Management Program that is in compliance with U.S. EPA ARP requirements. \n\nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the format published by U.S. EPA.  This document identifies the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, including comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs.  In addition, this RMP identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios, the potential off-site consequences of those releases, and the facility's five year accidental release history.  This RMP certifies that prevention and emergency response programs are in place so as to minimize risks to workers and the potentially affected public.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n1.0   CLEAN HARBORS  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY  RESPONSE POLICIES \n\n1.1    Corporate Stateme"

Accordingly, CHCI has prepared a Risk Management Plan under the U.S. EPA's predictive filing provisions.  CHCI will not exceed the threshold quantities for toxic and flammable gases.\n\nCHCI's accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The CHCI facility is designed, constructed, inspected, maintained and operated in a manner so as to minimize the risk of exposure to employees and the public to hazardous materials managed at the site, and in conformity with all governmental regulations.\n\nCHCI has a comprehensive inspection plan which requires daily, weekly, monthly, and annual inspections of its processes, equipment and management practices.\n\nCHCI has a Contingency Plan which prescribes procedures to be followed in the event of a fire or release at the facility.  The Contingency Plan includes procedures for notifying local, state and federal emergency response officials of incidents, and specifies arrangements which are made with emergency responders to ensure an effective response in the event of an emergency.\n\nCHCI has a training plan which ensures that each employee receives the training necessary to enable him/her to safely and ef"

In order to standardize and simplify to a practical level the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that would diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses.  For that reason, both the results for the standardized \"worst case\" defined by the EPA methods and an alternative case, which is believed by Clean Harbors to more realistically represent situations that may possibly occur within the lifetime of the facility, are presented and described.  The actual incident history for this facility over the last five years has been reviewed.  No accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, emergency response, or damage to property or the environment\n\n3.1    Worst-Case Release for Toxic Substances.\n\nAs defined by 40 CFR Part 68, a worst-case release for a toxic liquid is an instantaneous spill of the entire contents of a 55-gallon drum.  The worst-case release scenario for the Clean Harbors facility corresponds to a release from a 55-gallon drum filled with phosphorous oxychloride. \n\nEPA requires that worst-case analyses be conducted using stability class F and 1.5 m/sec wind speed. Meteorologists have defined six \"atmospheric stability classes,\" A through F, each representing a decreasing degree of turbulence in the atmosphere.  The most turbulent condition is stability A, which is associated with light winds and very strong solar heating.  Stabilities B and C are characterized by progressively weaker solar heating and stronger winds.  Neutral or D stability occurs when winds are strong or when the sky is overcast.  At night the earth's surface cools, causing the lower atmosphere to stabilize and become less turbulent.  Stability E (moderately stable) corresponds to partly cloudy condi"

Stability class F (very stable) represents a very low level of turbulence due to overnight radiational cooling and weak winds.\n\nTo describe the aerodynamic surface roughness for modeling purposes, EPA has established surface roughness categories based on land-use type. 'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings, compact residential areas and trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are few buildings and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed by trees.  The Clean Harbors Bristol facility and vicinity are urban in nature.\n\nThe toxic endpoint selected by EPA for toxic substances is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  An ERPG-2 is \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects, or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  \n\nWorst-case dispersion modeling to determine the distance to toxic endpoint was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*COMP (Version 1.06) software.  RMP*COMP implements the consequence analysis calculations set forth in the EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG). The resulting emergency response planning zone is defined by a circle with a radius equal to 1.9 miles.  \n\nThe worst-case planning zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 17,312, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's LANDVIEW III program.  The potential worst-case planning zone includes schools, public recreation areas and commercial areas.  \n\n3.2    Alternative Release for Toxic Substances\n\nThe alternative release examined for all of the 18 regulated chemicals corresponds to an accident occurring during on-site handling of a 55 gallon drum, where the drum is acci"

The unconfined spill was modeled with RMP*Comp to estimate endpoint distances for the 18 regulated substances that may at some time be present at the site. The alternative scenario was simulated using meteorological conditions that are typical of the Bristol, Connecticut area. In RMP*Comp, EPA uses meteorological conditions for alternative releases of D stability and a wind speed of 3 m/sec.  Stability Class D represents conditions of neutral stability, or moderate atmospheric turbulence.  Based on climatological data from the Hartford, Connecticut airport,  the average wind speed is about 4 m/sec, providing greater dilution than assumed in RMP*Comp.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling to determine the distance to toxic endpoint was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*COMP (Version 1.06) software.  As discussed in Section 3.1, the modeling was performed using the conservative assumption of urban surface roughness. The resulting planning zone is defined by a circle ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 miles, depending on the chemical spilled. The public area within these radii is limited.  Public receptors within 0.3 miles include residences and commercial areas. No environmental receptors would be affected.\n\n3.3    Worst Case Release for Flammable Substances\n\nThe worst case for flammable substance is defined as a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest  amount of a regulated substance in a single vessel.  The endpoint is a 1 psi overpressure. The largest vessel containing a regulated flammable substance at the Bristol facility is a 55 gallon drum.  Applying RMP*Comp results in an estimated worst-case endpoint distance of 0.05 miles for ethyl ether (90%).  This zone extends off-site, affecting adjacent commercial areas, but does not impact residential areas.\n\n3.4    Alternative Flammable Release\n\nThe potential for a vapor cloud explosion resulting from an outdoor release of a flammable liquid is extremely unlikely.

Thus, the impact of an alternative release does not extend to the facility fenceline.\n\n\n4.0   ACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nClean Harbors has procedures in place to prevent and mitigate potential releases of toxic and flammable substances.  These procedures are detailed in CHCI's RCRA Part B hazardous waste license.  The procedures include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n* An inspection program which requires daily, weekly, monthly and annual inspections of process equipment, alarm systems, and management practices, with a procedure for documenting and correcting any deficiencies identified in inspections.\n\n* A standard operating procedure for the transfer of flammable and combustible liquids.\n\n* A standard operating procedure for ensuring that incompatible materials are not consolidated together.\n\n* A waste analysis plan which ensures that the waste received by CHCI conforms to the waste as initially represented by each generator, and that each waste stream is managed correctly.\n\n* A security plan to prevent unknowing or unwanted access to the facility.\n\n* A training plan which ensures that each employee at the facility is adequately trained to perform their job duties knowledgeably and safely.\n\nIn addition, consistent with ARP regulations, Clean Harbors has instituted a level 2 prevention program consisting of the following elements:\n\n      Safety Information  including MSDS for regulated substances\n\n        Hazard Review, including a systematic evaluation of potential hazards associated with handling regulated substances and development of recommendations for improving safety\n\n        Operating Procedures regarding transfer, storage and processing of regulated substances\n\n        Training  of workers on operating procedures\n\n        Maintenance procedures to maintain "

This means that no accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, off-site evacuation or sheltering in place, or damage to property or the environment.\n\n\n6.0   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIt is the policy of Clean Harbors to place the highest priority on employee safety and health and on protection of the community from all plant-induced environmental conditions.  An emergency response plan has been developed which prescribes emergency procedures which the facility will implement in the event of a release or fire at the facility.\n\nCHCI's emergency response plan is identified as the facility Contingency Plan.  The purpose of this plan is to describe both the hazards associated with the management of waste materials at the facility and the steps which will be taken to minimize the risk associated with each hazard.  By ensuring that proper preventative measures are taken at all times and by providing for emergency response procedures to be followed in the event of any unexpected occurrence(s), CHCI intends to operate its facility in a manner that does not pose a significant threat to public health, safety or welfare of the environment.  CHCI's record in this regard has been exceptional and its overall contribution to the protection of human health and the environment far surpasses the risks associated with the type of activities performed at the facility.\n\nThe specific elements of CHCI's Contingency Plan include the following:\n\n* A general description of the facility operations and the types of hazardous wastes handled at the facility.\n\n* A list of the CHCI emer"

Personnel training is necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  CHCI's training plan achieves this goal.  These programs are all documented so that needed information about the safe handling of all chemicals present at the facility is available to employees, and can be readily interpreted by emergency response team staff and the Facility Emergency Coordinators when questions arise from public safety officials regarding potential risks to the community.  All of these features of the RMP and the integrated risk management program at this site lead to operations that meet or exceed the state and federal regulatory requirements applicable to the facility's operations."
