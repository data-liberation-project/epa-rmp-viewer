Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of CAPS (Circular Area Profiling  System) which uses data from the 2010 US Census Bureau.

The facility maintains a written Emergency Action/Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public.

Koch Foods has implemented strict preventive maintenance procedures and an Emergency Action/Response Plan (EAP).  Release of ammonia is specially covered in the Emergency Action Plan and contains all required actions in the event of release of ammonia.  As part of the facility's accidental release prevention, training is conducted for employees and new hires.  Accidental release prevention, training and awareness are reinforced annually and as operations at the facility dictates.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nKoch Foods is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with off-site emergency response support.\r\n\r\n\r\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nPresently ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for cold storage and distribution operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Koch Foods (Distribution Center) is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenari"
