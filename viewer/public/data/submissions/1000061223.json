Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, KY Packing has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 KY Packing, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that KY Packing has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                 | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration          Anhydrous Ammonia                20,000\n\n\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obli"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nKY Packing operates a commercial packing and storage facility for cherries and other fruit in Reedley, CA. The facility has an ammonia system provides refrigeration capacity to three (3) storage rooms, two (2) precool rooms, one (1) hydrocooler, and a loading dock.  The rooms utilize bunker mounted evaporator coils and the loading dock utilizes ceiling suspended direct expansion evaporators that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas. The gas is piped to four (4) reciprocating compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into the liquid transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure"

In 2012, the name was changed to KY Packing.\n\n\n\nThe facility was designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at KY Packing consists of equipment, piping, and vessels which are interconnected.  Therefore, the ammonia system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nKY Packing has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the KY Packing facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all proce"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nKY Packing has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, KY Packing continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved KY Packing's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that KY Packing's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nKY Packing has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date.

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for KY Packing employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program KY Packing will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
