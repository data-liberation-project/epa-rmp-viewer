At the time of revision (June, 2009) of the RMP, the WTP is operated for the City under a contract with American Water Services, Inc.   American Water Services, Inc. has developed a Risk Management Program (RMP) for the control of catastrophic releases of extremely hazardous substances at the WTP.  The RMP builds on the commitment of both the City of Waterbury and American Water Services to the protection of its neighbors, its employees and the control of the potential for such a release.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the Chemical Accident Prevention rule (40 CFR 68) in June, 1996.  This rule requires any facility with a process that involves more than a threshold quantity (TQ) of some 140 hazardous compounds to prepare a risk management plan (RMP).  HEITKAMP, Inc through it's consultant Camp Dresser & McKee Inc. (CDM) prepared the original RMP in June, 1999 which applies to the use of Chlorine, which has a TQ of 2500 pounds and is used for disinfection of drinking water at the WTP.  Because American Water Services continues to maintain a maximum amount of 36,000 pounds of Chlorine on site since obtaining the operating contract with the City of Waterbury on July, 2003 this Revised RMP is being submitted by June 18, 2009.\n\nAmerican Water uses chlorine stored in 2000 pound pressurized steel cylinders for disinfection of drinking water.  At any given time, up to six such cylinders may be tied into the process, with an additional twelve cylinders in storage available to go on line.  Chlorine is delivered to the WTP on as as-needed basis. Althought the chlorine exists as a liquid under pressure inside the cylinders, it is passed into the disinfection process as a gas through a series of pipes and valves at near ambient temperature and pressure until it is injected into the liquid process stream and goes into sol"

The WTP has an active chlorine leak detection system linked to an alarm and ventilation system in place and operational in those indoor areas of the WTP where gaseous chlorine could likely be present.  \n\nThe RMP summarizes existing documentation used by American Water Services, Inc. for the WTP and supplements the procedures described in other City of Waterbury documents such as general administrative guidelines and safety and health manuals.  The RMP addresses American Water Services, Inc.'s management prodedures, hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency and emergency response program (ERP) that are consistent with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention rule.  Each major element of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule is addressed in the RMP in detail.  American Water Services, Inc.'s Plant Manager is the primary person for the operator responsible for implementing the provisions of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule for the WTP.\n\nAmerican Water Service, Inc. conducted an analysis of chlorine release potential at the WTP.  This analysis presents results of the worst case release scenario as required by 40 CFR 68.25 and an alternative case release scenario as required by 40 CFR 68.28 and public receptors are potentially affected by each scenario.  However, over the last five years no release meeting the provisions of 40 CFR 68.42(a) has occurred at the WTP.\n\nThe prevention program of the RMP includes a Process Safety Management / Risk Management document with 14 sections. Management System, Employee participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazards Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Safety, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit (Although American Water does not consider these permits applicable at this time since outside Contractors are not utilized presently), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, Complian"

The chlorine handling equipment at the WTP was designed to safely contain chlorine but in the event of an accidental chlorine release, a chlorine detection and alarm system will alert personnel at the WTP to the need for an emergency response.\n\nAmerican Water Services, Inc. conducted a process hazard analysis of the chlorine process.  The process hazard analysis team consisted of American Water Services personnel knowledgable in process operation and maintenance and knowledgeable in the process hazard analysis process.  The process hazard analysis team used a what-if / checklist technique and recommendations were compiled and are being implemented.\n\nAmerican Water Services, Inc. has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) that provide system descriptions, specifications and operating steps for the chlorine system.  The SOPs address the start-up, shutdown, inspections, temporary operation, emergency procedures and trouble-shooting.  SOPs to provide for mechanical integrity of the chlorine process equipment rely on manufacturer's recommended approaches.  The RMP contains details of this approach.\n\nOur prevention measures include the use of:\n\n- chlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n- process safety information to document the safe process design;\n- process hazards analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n- operating procedures to ensure that the sytem is operated safely;\n- maintenance, inspection and testing to ensure that the system is maintained according to applicable standards and manufacture's recommendation;\n- training, hot work permits (if ever required), contractor safety and employee participation programs to ensure that all employ"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major chlorine release.\n\nIn the event that a chlorine release does occur, the Waterbury Water Plant has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the local emergency responders (Thomaston Fire Department) who would dispatch a trained HAZMAT team to the site to handle the chlorine release.  For all but minor releases of chlorine, American Water Services, Inc. intends to rely on the Thomaston, Connecticut Fire Department for response to an accidental release of chlorine, including providing incident command, local area evacuation and shelter-in-place notifications and coordination with other appropriate agencies.
