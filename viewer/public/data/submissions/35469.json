Since the refrigeration system handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Columbine Vineyards has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the ammonia based refrigeration process.  \n\nAs part of the PSM program, Columbine Vineyards has completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration system, established a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration system on a daily basis, Columbine Vineyards has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration system is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\n\nPersonnel from Columbine Vineyards monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration system.  All service, maintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration system are contracted to a qualified licensed refrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform routine service, maintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating condition. \n\nWhile it is Columbine Vineyards? objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Columbine Vineyards and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n \nColumbine Vineyards has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations."

Delano is the closest city to the Columbine Vineyards cold storage facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides process cooling for the Columbine Vineyards cold storage facility.  \n\nThe original Cecil Avenue cold storage facility was constructed in the 1940s.  In 1992, the ammonia based refrigeration system was substantially modernized when the cold storage facility was expanded.  The ammonia refrigeration system was expanded again in 1999.  The refrigeration system currently consists of the following major components:\n\n? Four compressors \n? Two evaporative condensers in ammonia service\n? A cooling tower to cool the natural gas fired engines \n? A high pressure receiver \n? Low suction accumulator\n? Liquid ammonia transfer system\n? Four pre-cool rooms (8 zones)\n? Nine cold storage rooms (10 zones)\n? Direct expansion evaporators (hallway)\n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be ?pumped down? to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the outdoor high pressure receiver is 19,428 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 and the CalARP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented at Columbine V"

Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\n\n? Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n? Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n? A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n? Pre-startup safety reviews will be performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n? Audits will be conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the RMP regulations.\n\n? Incident investigation procedures have been established.\n\n? A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation has been developed and implemented.\n\n?

However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Columbine Vineyards? employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Columbine Vineyards regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety.  Currently, Columbine Vineyards does not have any changes planned for the anhydrous ammonia based refrigeration process to improve safety."
