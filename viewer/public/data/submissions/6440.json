Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAll wastewater plant operating employees are to be trained on the proper handling of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide tanks and feed systems, and emergency response contact policies in a timely fashion following their employment at the facility, and will receive refresher training on an annual basis thereafter.\n\nAn outside agency (Connersville Fire Department) is to be notified in the event of a potential or actual release of Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide outside the facility. The Fire Department will be responsible for any necessary notifications of the public and/or trained and equipped hazardous materials responders.\n\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance(s)\n\nThe Connersville Utilities owns and operates a wastewater treatment plant in Connersville, Indiana.  It uses Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide stored in 2,000-pound cylinder tanks.  \n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide gases are drawn from the tanks using a low-pressure water induction system for injection a various points in the water treatment system.\n\nNo more than three (3) 2,000-pound tanks of Chlorine are on-hand at any time, for a maximum total quantity of 6,000 pounds of Chlorine.\n\nNo more than three (2) 2,000-pound tanks of Sulfur Dioxide are on-hand at any time, for a maximum total quantity of 4,000 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide.\n\n3. Worst Case Scenario  ---  Chlorine\n\nThe worst case scenario is the rupture of one cylinder tank containing 2,000 pounds of Chlorine.\n\nThe contents of the cylinder tank would be released as Chlorine gas at a rate of 200 pounds per minute over a period of ten (10 minutes).  The total quantity released would be 2,000 pounds.\n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint is calculated at .9 miles using RMP Comp as the modeling calculation tool.\n\n4. Alternative Case Scenario --- Chlorine\n\nA portion of the contents of the cylinder tank would be releas"

Alternative Case Scenario --- Sulfur Dioxide\n\nA portion of the contents of the cylinder tank would be released as Sulfur Dioxide gas at a rate of 2 pounds per minute over a period of 30 minutes.  The total quantity released would be 60 pounds.\n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint is calculated at .1 miles using RMP Comp as the modeling calculation tool.\n\n\n\n7. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is based upon a combination of management practices and low pressure vacuum feeders specifically designed for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide gases.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Five-Year Accident History  ---  Chlorine\n\nThe Connersville Utilities Wastewater Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of Chlorine gas in the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\n9.

Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Connersville Utilities Wastewater Treatment Plant is not required to have an emergency response program since response activities will be handled by public responders.  However, emergency issues have been coordinated with the Connersville  Fire Department and the Fa"
