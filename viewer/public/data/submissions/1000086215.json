There are various public receptors within this radius, including schools, residences, hospitals, recreational areas, and major commercial, office or industrial areas. No environmental receptors were identified within the distance to the endpoint. Neither passive nor active mitigations were considered.\r\n\r\nNo accidents involving formaldehyde have occurred on-site within the past five years. The qualified person or position with overall responsibility for implementing the risk management program elements at the facility is the Plant HSE Manager who directly supervises all plant operators on safety matters.\r\n\r\nAs a chemical production facility, Syntech Chemicals has operations that involve highly variable quantities of formaldehyde, a regulated toxic substance. However, Syntech Chemicals is able to forecast its inventory with some degree of accuracy. Because Syntech Chemicals will not always store more than the threshold quantity of formaldehyde on-site, it is submitting an RMP through predictive filing. Under 40 CFR \u00a768.190, Syntech Chemicals is required to update and resubmit its RMP no later than the date on which formaldehyde is first present above a threshold quantity. By using predictive filing, Syntech Chemicals is avoiding the requirement to update and resubmit its RMP every time it receives and stores more than 15,000 pounds of formaldehyde onsite."

      "SummaryText": "Syntech Chemicals, Inc., located at 14822 Hooper Road in Houston, Harris County, Texas 77047 is a chemical production facility. Because Syntech produces a variety of products through blending or repackaging processes, the batch size, number of batches produced per year and the size of the reactor vary per product. As part of the process for one product, Syntech Chemicals may use and store a maximum of 58,000 pounds of formaldehyde in a single vessel as a part of its operations. Formaldehyde (CAS 50-00-0) is listed as a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR \u00a768.130. The threshold quantity for formaldehyde is 15,000 pounds. Therefore, the use of formaldehyde is a covered process. This covered process is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program because it does not meet the eligibility requirements for Program 1, and is subject to the OSHA PSM standard. Formaldehyde is listed as a regulated substance under the OSHA PSM standard; therefore, the process is subject to OSHA PSM and consequently, assigned to Program 3.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release analysis would be an unmitigated gas release. The release rate was calculated to be 5,800 pounds per minute for a release duration of 10 minutes. Assuming a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second,atmospheric stability class F, and urban topography, the distance to endpoint was calculated to be ~20 miles. Within this 20 mile radius, a residential population of 2.8 million people was estimated. There are various public and environmental receptors within this radius, including schools, residences, hospitals, prison/correctional facilities, recreational areas, major commercial, office or industrial areas, and a state park. Passive mitigations were not considered.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release analysis would occur due to overfilling of the vessel containing formaldehyde. The release rate was calculated to be 478 pounds per minute for a release duration of 15 minutes. Assuming a wind speed of 3 meters per second,atmospheric stability class D,"
