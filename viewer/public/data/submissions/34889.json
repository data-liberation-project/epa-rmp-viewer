      "SummaryText": "The City of Aurora, Colorado, Utilities Department operates two drinking water treatment facilities which provide water to the 280,000 citizens of the city. Drinking water produced at these two facilities exceeds the quality standards set by the USEPA and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Water treated at the facilites comes from high quality mountain lakes and from City managed reservoirs.\nDuring the years of 1999-2001 the City of Aurora renovated the Leonard R. Kuiper Water Treatment Plant. The treatment plant which is a direct filtration drinking water treatment plant, had the plant capacity increased from 70 to 100 MGD. The facility renovation upgraded much of the original construction with new state of the art equipment and construction. Major areas of construction were the chemical storage  facilities.  A new building that houses all of the process chemicals was constructed. The building meets all of the current building and fire codes. The building houses ammonia storage and pumping equipment in a separate room. The chlorine systems were completely remodeled and a chlorine scrubber was installed. The entire chemical building is covered by a sprinkler system and has process sensors and alarms that are tied to a monitoring system. \nThe plant was rededicated as the Thomas G. Griswold Water Treatment Plant at the completion of the renovation. \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nChlorine is used at the facility for disinfection of the water. Chlorine is handled in 1-ton containers. The containers are housed in a room specifically designed for chlorine handling. The room is enclosed and is connected to a chlorine scrubber that will operate in the event of a release. The HVAC system has been designed to shut down if a release is detected so that the room air is contained in the room and not released to the atmosphere. The storage and chlorinator rooms are monitored continously for any releases. The release detectors are tied to a monitoring system th"

      "SummaryText": "at will alert facility staff to any releases.  A Chlorine \"B\" repair kit is stationed in the room if necessary to carry out any repairs. Self contained breathing appratus are stationed outside the room in multiple locations in the event of an accidental release.  Standard operating procedures (SOP) for the delivery, replacement, and return of the containers are in place at the facility.   \n\nAqua ammonia is used for the disinfection of the treated water. The ammonia is stored in an H-7 rated occupancy room. There is secondary containment for the liquid in the room in the event of a accidential release. The room is monitored continously for any releases of ammnonia. The release detector is tied to a monitoring system to alert facility staff to any problems. \n\nFacility Safety\n\nOf utmost importance to the City is safety of the public, environment and its employees. In order to maintain safe conditions, the City has developed plans for the responsible operations of the plant, emergency response, and routine maintenance.\nThe accidental release prevention and response policies are embodidied in the Griswold WTP SOPs and the City of Aurora Emergency Response Plan. The Griswold staff has cooperated with local emergency responders to develop emergency response operation procedures. Training drills have been staged with the Aurora Fire Protection Department. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies and procedures are kept at both facilities. Policies in these documents have been developed with the cooperation of the City's Risk Management and Fire Protection Departments. Employees are trained to respond in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance. \n\nEmergency Response\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan is in place at the facility and is coordinated with the City of Aurora Fire Protection Department, Aurora Police Department and the LEPC. Drills are conducted to keep responders and plant personnel up to date on response procedures."
