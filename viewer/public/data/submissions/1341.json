Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Farmers Union Oil Company of New Rockford/Sheyenne in New Rockford are strongly\ncommitted to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of\nour comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design,\ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes\nat our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\nregulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are\nat hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts\nwith the Eddy County LEPC, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in an 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in New Rockford (Figure 1).  The maximum\namount stored is 15,480 gallons (79,660.08 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 86%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (79,660.08 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.2 miles (Figure 2)."
