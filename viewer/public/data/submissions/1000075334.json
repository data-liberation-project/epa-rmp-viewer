Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nWe at the Grimmway Enterprises, Inc. / Mt. View Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility.  IT is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\n2.   The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nOur facilityA\u00bfs primary activities encompass Carrot processing and storage.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  Substance one is ammonia (anhydrous) and is used as a refrigerant in our plant.  Substance two is chlorine gas which is used for water treatment in our plant. \r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 28,343 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine (gas) at our facility is 30,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:  \r\n\r\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPAA\u00bfs OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPAA\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and the RMP-COMP calculation program.\r\n\r\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Grimmway/Mt. View Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractorA\u00bfs work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \r\n\r\n5.  Five Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThe Grimmway/Mt. View Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\n6.  Emergency Response Plan:\r\n\r\nThe Grimmway/Mt. View Plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspect of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation procedures, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as past incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nGrimmway Enterprises also maintains a fully stacked hazardous materials response van as well as highly trained complement of hazardous response first responders, technicians, and incident commanders.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  All response team members receive annual refresher training.
