Primary emergency response policy\ndocuments are found in:\n  Risk Management Procedure RM007\n  Engineering & Maintenance Procedures\n  Environmental (WWTP) Operating Procedures\n  Production Operating Procedures\n  Site-wide Risk Management Procedures\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario: Involves a release of ethylene oxide from a railcar on our\nsiding. This scenario assumes that the entire contents of a railcar (180,000 lbs) would be\nreleased within a ten minute time period. This is modeled to a concentration of 50 parts\nper million (ERPG-2) of ethylene oxide into the air, which has a theoretical impact zone of\n4.08 miles. This scenario is required to assume highly improbable circumstances including\nthat the event could occur, to begin with, and that all safety pevention and emergency\nresponse measures all fail at the same time.\n\nAlternate release scenarios include administrative controls and mitigation measures.

Administrative controls to limit potential offsite impacts include chain-of-command\nmanagement with specific overlapping staff assignments for release prevention, emergency\nresponse, etc.; 24 hours a day, seven days per week facility staffing; active fire watch\nduring holiday shutdown periods; active embership in and coordination with the Spartanburg\nCounty Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC); and, active membership in and coordination\nwith the Arkwright Voluntary Fire Department (AVFD). Mitigation measures to limit potential\noffsite impact include state-of-the-art leak detection and control systems; railcar unloading\nstation equipped with a three car emergency deluge system; dedicaed diesel powered\nemergency fire water supply system; and, almost 40 remote emergency alarms throughout\nthe facility. The alternative release scenario for the site with the greatest potential offsite\nimpact involves a release of 175,000 pounds of liquid ethylene oxide due to the complete\nfailure of the primary pressure relief valve on the EO storage tank. This release scenario\nassumes it would take a more reasonable period of time (at least 36 minutes) to completely\nempty the vessel. When modeled to a final dispersal concentration of 50 parts per million\nof ethylene oxide, ERPG-2 conditions, the effects of this scenario reach a distance of\nless than half a mile (0.48 miles). The alternate relase scenarios modeled for allyl alchol\n(transfer hose failure resulting in 12,995 pounds released) and propylene oxide (relief\nvalve failure and release of 62,820 pounds) have a potential offsite impacts of areas smaller\nthan the model for ethylene oxide. Specifically, the the propylene oxide and allyl alcohol\nalternate release scenarios would impact areas approximately 370 feet and 740 feet from\nthe spill, respectively.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program: The site's Risk Management Procedure\nRM007, Emergency Response, addresses these issues.\n\nChemical specific preve"
