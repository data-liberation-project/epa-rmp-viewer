The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Red Hills Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Lea County LEPC. Mr. Lorenzo Velasquez is the contact for Lea County Emergency Management and can be reached at (575) 391-2983.  The Red Hills Gas Processing Plant has around-the-clock communications capability. Lucid operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Jal Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. Lucid conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations and the Red Hills Gas Processing Plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. Lucid's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Red Hills Gas Processing Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Red Hills Gas Processing Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe facility is a non-fractionating NGL extraction plant that is designed to process natural gas. Red Hills Plant 1 is designed for 60 MMSCFD. Red Hills Plant 2, 3, and 4 are each designed for 200 MMSCFD. The facility consists of the following: inlet gas separation and filtration, molecular sieve dehydration units, cryogenic processing units, glycol dehydration units, amine gas treating, condensate stabilization,  stabilizer overhead compression, residue gas compression, acid gas compression, NGL amine treating, refrigeration systems, hot oil systems, process flare system, acid gas flare system, and all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in five atmospheric tanks located within secondary containment areas and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGLs from the cryogenic units are sent offsite via pipeline. I"

Natural gas from residue compression is sent offsite via pipeline. \r\n\r\nThe processes at the Red Hills Gas Processing Plant are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Flammable Mixture. \r\n\r\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Red Hills Gas Processing Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the regulated substance in the facility.  \r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Red Hills Processing Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.
