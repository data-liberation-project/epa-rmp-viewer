Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at P & W AG in Tekamah are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental\nsafety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Tekamah Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have\nanhydrous\nammonia stored in a 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Tekamah (Figure 1, ammonia).  The\nmaximum amount stored is 15,300 gallons (78,734 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85\n%.\n\nWe also have propane stored in a 18,000-gallon tank located at our facility in Tekamah (Figure 1,\npropane).  The maximum amount stored is 15,300 gallons (64,612 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85 %.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these\nscenarios.\n\n            3.1     Ammonia\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (78,734 pounds) in gaseous "

At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance\nto\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.2 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population within a\n4.2-mile\nradius of this facility is 2,500.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line. \nThe\nscenario involves the release of 11,873.12 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of\n30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of\n0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of\nthe\nfacility is 900.\n\n            3.2     Propane\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\npropane\nstorage tank (64,612 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric\nstability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is\n0.32\nmiles (Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of houses and can\nresult\nin serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated population within a 0.32-mile\nradius\nof this facility is 900.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  Under neutral weather\nconditions, the maximum distance to a lower flammability endpoint of 35 mg/L at a release rate\nof \n5,000 pounds per minute is less than 0.06 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a\n0.06-\nmile radius of this facility is 50.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release\nprevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess S"

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nP & W AG maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered\nprocesses are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nP & W AG has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nP & W AG conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\noperation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in\nmaintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the\nmaintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at P & W AG to manage changes in process chemicals,\ntechnology,\nequipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose\njob tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the\nmodification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nP & W AG routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\nmodifications\nin established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm "

Any non-compliance issue\ndiscovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nP & W AG truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team\neffort. \nCompany employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident\nprevention\nissues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all\ninformation\ncreated as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting\nfrom\nprocess hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nP & W AG has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. \nDue\nto our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n  6. Emergency Response Plan\nP & W AG maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of\nhazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid\nand\nmedical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the\npublic.\n"
