The facility maintains a safety committee (a trained Emergency Response team) whose members are designated emergency coordinators for the facility who will respond to minor leaks. The emergency response team is trained to call 9-1-1 in an event of an ammonia release. The 9-1-1 operator will contact the University Park Fire Department. Employees within the building are evacuated to a point upwind of the facility or shelter in place. Evacuation drills are performed annually. This Plan will be reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE \n\nDOT Foods, Inc. safety committee has completed several items, including the recommendations, in a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items: 1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs. 2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development. 3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation. 4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

The condensers are mounted on the machine room roof and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe DOT Foods, Inc. facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems. These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine rooms as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shutdown systems. In addition, much of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room or on the engine rooms roof (condensers). There are ammonia and temperature sensors placed in the engine rooms, freezer, cooler, and dock areas. In the event of ammonia detection, a facility alarm sounds, and a visible alarm is triggered. In addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, in particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Start-up, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nAn investigation into the DOT Foods, Inc. University Park facility\u2019s accident history revealed that there have been zero reportable ammonia releases over the past five years. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDOT Foods, Inc. has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility. The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility.
