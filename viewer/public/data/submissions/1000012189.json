The employees at the Sanborn Terminal & Storage are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* Emergency Response Programs\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Sanborn Terminal that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Sanborn Terminal is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline and propane storage/loading facility.  The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe Sanborn Terminal has two pipelines that are routed through the facility and are regulated by the Department of Transportation.  These two pipelines are a mixed product line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane) and a dedicated propane pipeline.  The facility receives propane from either pipeline (primarily from the dedicated propane pipeline) into one of eight propane storage ta"

This material is routed from these tanks to the truck transport loading docks for wholesale to propane retailers.\n\nA small quantity of ethyl mercaptan is used to stench the propane at the truck transport docks and this flammable chemical may also be present above the threshold quantity at the Sanborn Terminal.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nAt the present time there are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Sanborn Terminal.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nAt the present time there are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Sanborn Terminal.\n\nWorse Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the propane storage tanks resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.

All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity, endpoint and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\nAlternate Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at the normal truck loading flow rate for 10 minutes after the line break.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  This consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  This scenario would be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown devices would be expected to isolate the source of the material and secure the facility in less than the assumed 10-minute time frame in most cases.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.

Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the O'Brien County L.E.P.C., O'Brien County Sheriff's Department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service  All Enterprise Sanborn Terminal operating technicians receive Hazmat Technician training, including 40 hours of initial training and 8 hours of annual refresher training to help insure that resonse to any emergency situation is implemented correctly and as quickly as possible.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, to shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, to contact the Company's Houston Control Center and to secure the area.  The Houston Control Center notifies local emergency response agencies (O'Brien County Sheriff's Department and local Fire Departments) by utilizing the 9-1-1 emergency call system.  Remote activation of pipeline or facility shutoffs can also be accomplished from Houston Control which has area video cameras with dial up monitoring access.  In addition, there are facility gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by Sanborn Terminal operating technicians.  Designated Company employees also contact the necessary state and federal agencies to report the incident, if required.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEnterprise Products takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  The Process Safety Management systems address each of the key features of a successful prevention program, including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - \"PSSR\"\n* Compliance audits\n\n\n\n\n* Incident investigation\n"

A training program has been developed in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the facility, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  Employees are trained on, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\nThere is an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies with the process equipment prior to any incident.\n\nThe Operations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  For example, if the gas detection system is activated, a system annunciation is sounded in Houston Control and at the local facility.  This system will activate the shutdown system by dropping all delivery checks and shutting down all delivery pumps to the loading docks.  Enterprise Products Operating LLC is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community.\n\nAccident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, this facility has not had an accidental release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that are planned for implementati"
