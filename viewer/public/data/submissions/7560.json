      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nCrest Foam Industries Incorporated uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) to manufacture flexible polyurethane foam products at its plant in Moonachie, New Jersey.  The TDI is received in 40,000 pound truckload quantities and off loaded into storage containers.  The total quantity of TDI at the plant never exceeds 110,000 pounds.  Crest Foam Industries Incorporated initially developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility in order to comply with the requirements of New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).  The RMP being submitted is derived from that original plan.  The Risk Management Plan been successfully operating since September 1988.  The program is audited annually by the NJ Department of Environmental Protection.  The company has not had a reportable accident in over five years. \n\nIncluded at the end of the summary are descriptions and results of the worst case & alternative release scenarios.  For both cases, the estimated radius to toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles with an impact on the surrounding population of approximately 84 people.  The estimated radius to toxic endpoint was calculated using the EPA's RMP*Comp program, while the effects to the offsite population were calculated using the EPA's Landview program, which utilized census data for Bergen County, NJ. \n\nThis executive summary describes the elements of the Crest Foam Industries Incorporated RMP which include: \n\n7 Standard Operating Procedures\n7 Safety Review\n7 Preventive Maintenance\n7 Operator Training\n7 Accident Investigation\n7 Risk Assessment\n7 Emergency Response\n7 Risk Management Program Audits\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nStandard Operating Procedures include the following elements:  process flow sheets; procedures for normal operations; description of abnormal conditions and appropriate corrective actions; description of emergency conditions and appropriate corrective actions; pre-startup, startup, and shutdown procedures; description of safety devices; safety pr"

The Standard Operating Procedures are continually updated to reflect any changes or modifications to the system.  \n\n\nSafety Review\n\nThe Safety Review involves comparing facility design, equipment, and operations with the current state-of-the-art.  The safety review also requires that the plant be visually inspected to determine if safety devices are functioning properly, if actual operating conditions are within design limits, and if the actual conditions reflect Standard Operation Procedures. The findings and any deficiencies are then documented in a written report.  A number of documents must be prepared to facilitate the safety review.  These documents include:  process description and process chemistry, process flow sheets, piping and instrument diagrams, facility location maps, site plans and equipment layout, electrical one-line diagrams, electrical area classification drawing, specifications far safety release devices, specifications for materials of construction, EHS inventories, and a listing of external forces and events (such as floods. power outages, etc.) that could influence safe operations. The documents required to support a safety review have been assembled from existing drawings.  The company's plant engineer performs the formal safety review on an annual basis.\n\n\nPreventive Maintenance\n\nThe preventative Maintenance Program consists of procedures for maintaining equipment safety, establishing the frequency and scheduling of maintenance work, and documenting the process.  The Preventive Maintenance Program includes:  a listing of TDI-related equipment; procedures for controlling equipment modifications; a schedule for equipment inspections; schedule and procedures for testing safety devices; schedule and procedures for check of safety instruments; procedures for commissioning/decommissioning equipment; schedule and"

The company's Lab/Chemist is responsible for managing this program.\n\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nCrest Foam Industries Incorporated completes a hazard analysis at least once every 5 years for the TDI system.  The hazard analysis involves reviewing equipment failure records and accident reports to identify possible causes of accidental releases of TDI using a what if' analysis or another accepted procedure.
