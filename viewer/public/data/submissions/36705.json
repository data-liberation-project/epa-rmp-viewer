This Plant is one of six water and\r\nWastewater Plants operated by the City. Water Plant#2 \r\nand four other plants have quanties of regulated hazardous \r\nchemicals above the EPA threshold. The City has a unified\r\nRisk Management Program which applies to each plant. Only\r\nWater Treatment Plant #2 operations and policies are \r\npresented in this Plan.\r\n\r\nWater Treatment Plant #2 uses one regulated substances \r\nchlorine (CAS Number 7782-50-5)in the chlorination process.\r\nThe chlorination process consists of the use of chlorine \r\nfrom one-ton cylinders to disinfect Drinking water.\r\n\r\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management\r\nProgram (RMP), the facility has developed an accidental\r\nrelease prevention program and emergency action plan for\r\nthe facility.  The accidental release prevention program\r\nsatisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the \r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA)\r\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) program.  The prevention \r\nprogram ensures that the facility is operated under safe\r\nconditions and that any risk of an accidental release due \r\nto human error, the facility's prevention program ensures \r\nthat operating procedures are current and reviewed annually. \r\nTraining also plays a vital part in the facility's program.\r\nEmployees and contractors working near or on the chlorination \r\nprocess are required to be trained in the\r\nchlorination process and the hazards of chlorine.\r\n\r\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in a release, \r\nthe program ensures that equipment inspections, tests, and\r\npreventive maintenance are performed in accordance with \r\naccepted engineering practices, manufacturer's\r\nrecommendations, and planned m"

In addition, \r\nequipment pertaining to the chlorine process is visually\r\ninspected daily.  The potential for a chlorine release is\r\ngreatly reduced in the chlorination process due to the use\r\nof a vacuum system from point of chlorine withdrawal to its\r\npoint of application.  In the event that there is a failure\r\nin chlorination equipment, the system will automatically shut \r\ndown (i.e., failsafe).\r\n\r\nAll existing and proposed future chlorination equipment have\r\nbeen designed according to applicable standards and codes.\r\nThe facility maintains records and documentation on equipment\r\ninspection and tests.  Precautions are taken to\r\nensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and \r\ntestes, that all changes on the process are authorized, and\r\nemployees are informed of changes.\r\n\r\nThe facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to\r\naddress the hazards in the chlorination process and to\r\nevaluate and control where potential for a chlorine release \r\nexists.  Employees were involved in determining hazards of\r\nthe process and subsequent consequences.  The chlorination \r\nprocess was found to be operating safely and no changes were\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the \r\nRMP at the facility.  Employees have been assigned various\r\ntasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented.\r\nThe facility has developed management forms to\r\nassist employees in recording and documenting the various \r\nelements of the RMP.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the submittal of this Risk Management Program, \r\nthere have been no accidental releases of chlorine\r\nat this facility in the past five years.  However, in the event \r\nthat there is an accidental release of chlorine, an\r\nEmergency Action Plan has been written in compliance with \r\n29 CFR 1910.38.
