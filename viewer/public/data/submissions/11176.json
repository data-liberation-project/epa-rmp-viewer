This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Pueblo gas plant, located in rural Eastland County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to\nrecover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas.  The\ngas plant also recovers the regulated flammables, pentane and ethane.  There are no threshold\nquantities of toxic substances present.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 1\nprocesses at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the\nstorage tank containing 56,000 lb of natural gas liquids (NGL).  The maximum tank capacity is\nassumed to release and ignite.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.3\nmile.  Although we have a number of controls to prevent such releases, no credit for mitigation\nmeasures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nA second evaluated WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 1\nprocesses at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the\nstorage tank containing 125,100 lb of propane.

Examples of employee participation range from updating\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the\naccident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is\nmaintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In\naddition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and\nemployee safety issues.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Pueblo gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\ndesign basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned\nresponsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

This information is\nsupplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas\nplant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,\nlevel, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the\ndesign and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of\nconstruction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This\ninformation provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as\nevaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Pueblo gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with\nthe various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\nmanage these hazards.\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the What If analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team\nfindings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented\nand retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and\nrevalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five\nyears and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results\nand findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are\nforwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is\ndocumented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Pueblo gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\noperations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4)\nemergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These\nprocedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent\ntraining of new operators.

This refresher training is conducted\nat least every three years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means\nused to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Pueblo gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased\nmaintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process\nequipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work\nin a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in\ntheir workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand\nand follow plant safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find\nduring their work.
