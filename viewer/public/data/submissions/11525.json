In 1998, Lyondell acquired the assets of ARCO Chemical Company (ACC), including the facilities in South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia.  These facilities are located within the existing Union Carbide Corporation's South Charleston plant, and within the Rhone-Poulenc plant in Institute. Also included in this acquisition were urethanes research and development facilities located within the Union Carbide South Charleston Technical Center.\n\nWorldwide, the Lyondell enterprise operates in 15 countries, has approximately 11,000 employees, and consists of businesses with more than $17 billion in assets.  In West Virginia, Lyondell directly employs about 135 people and provides employment for about 135 people under contract from Union Carbide and Rhone-Poulenc. \n\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nThe Lyondell enterprise produces quality chemicals, polymers, and refined petroleum products that form the basis for plastics and synthetics of all kinds.  Products made from these materials fill the supermarket shelves and go into automobiles, housing, clothing and other necessities that improve the quality of life by making products safer, healthier and more convenient.\n\nThe products made at our West Virginia facilities belong to a family of chemicals called polyether polyols, and are derived from a chemical called propylene oxide, which is supplied by other Lyondell plants on the Gulf Coast. Polyols are used primarily in polyurethane foams for products ranging from bedding and furniture, to automotive applications such as seat\ncushions and energy absorbing instrument panels and side panels.

Other polyols products we make here are used by our customers for applications as diverse as roof coatings, varnishes, roller blade wheels, and bowling balls.  All of the products are shipped to customers in other states or are exported to Europe, Asia, and South America.\n\nAnother product from our West Virginia facilities is technology. The scientists and technicians at our South Charleston Technical Center work closely together with our manufacturing organization here to develop new or improved polyols products and process technologies. These new technologies can then be used by other Lyondell polyols manufacturing sites around the world.\n\n\nRESPONSIBLE CARE.\n\nLyondell Chemical Company is fully committed to the principles of Responsible Care, which is an initiative of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) to improve industry performance in the areas of environment, health and safety, to improve the industry's safe management of chemicals, and to respond to public concerns.  Since 1990, emissions of hazardous chemicals to the air from the Lyondell West Virginia facilities have been reduced by over 90% through improving processes and eliminating inefficient operations.  We have also made continuous improvements in our safety performance every year and rank among the industry leaders in this important aspect.  It is a policy of Lyondell to establish goals for continuous improvement in the areas of health, safety, and the environment based on sound science, risk assessment and benefit analysis, against which we will measure, audit and communicate our performance.\n\nAnother initiative for continuous improvement is called Manufacturing Excellence.  Manufacturing Excellence, launched in 1991, is a program of corporate standards which incorporates all of the Responsible Care.  codes and Lyondell's own rigorous management systems.

STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Lyondell Institute Plant is a manufacturing facility that produces a family of chemicals called polyether polyols.  The polyols we make are used by our customers to manufacture polyurethane foams for such applications as furniture cushions, mattresses and for automotive applications such as seat cushions and energy absorbing instrument panels and side panels. Other customer applications include various coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers. \n\nThe RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Institute Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements.  \n\nThe Lyondell Institute Plant handles an RMP-regulated toxic substance in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, is covered by the OSHA PSM standard, and falls under RMP Program Level 3. \n\nLyondell handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substance at the Institute Plant:\n    \n7 Propylene Oxide\n\n\nLyondell does not handle, process, or store threshold quantities of any RMP-regulated flammable chemicals at the Institute Plant.  \n\n\nIII.

In developing worst-case scenarios, companies must presume the release of the entire quantity of the largest container of a regulated chemical over a 10-minute period.  Only passive mitigation systems, such as those that do not require energy or action by an employee to initiate can be considered.  U.S. EPA acknowledges that these worst-case scenarios are unlikely to occur, so the RMP rule also requires that companies develop alternative release scenarios based on more credible release assumptions. \n\nAlternative release scenarios differ from worst-case scenarios in several important ways.  They may be based on actual incident history or on events which are more likely to occur, and allow the use of both active and passive mitigation to reduce the potential impact of a release on the community outside the facility.\n\nEPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Tables were used for evaluating the consequences of the WCS and ARS for both regulated flammable and toxic materials.  Use of these tables resulted in the determination of a release endpoint distance. The EPA-recommended LANDVIEW program was used to estimate the number of people potentially affected in each scenario.  The West Virginia Kanawha/Putnam County Emergency Services Maps and CD-ROM Program were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within the scenario endpoint distance.\n\nAccording to the RMP rule, the release endpoint distance is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected for each scenario.  It is intended to ensure that potential risks to the public health are recognized.  For toxic releases, the endpoint is the distance beyond which chemical concentrations are low enough that an average individual could be exposed for up to one hour without suffering irreversible or debilitating health effects.
