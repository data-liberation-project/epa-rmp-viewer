If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizers. The maximum quantity stored would be 149,000 pounds in our 3 storage tanks.  In addition to this we have 83,011 pounds of capacity in rolling stock (19 tanks of 1000 gallon water capacity figured at 85%, which is the maximum filled capacity with NH3).\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release and alternate scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns and falls under the homeland security act.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI K-61 and OSHA 29CFR 1910.111.

However, we plan to budget the time and funds needed to make any additional corrections the standard may require.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant proper damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nOur employees routinely inspect the plant for necessary maintenance or improvements.
