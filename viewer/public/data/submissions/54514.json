(MDU) Recovered Energy Generation (REG) facility (MDU CS-6) complies with numerous standards for pressure vessel design and testing as well as all Federal and North Dakota process safety management requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference. Regular inspection and testing of the pentane and thermal oil systems are performed to ensure equipment integrity is maintained. The facility is equipped with a network of leak detection equipment, automatic shutdown logic controls, insulation, safety relief valves, fire detection monitors. The facility will be operated by a contracted operator, Ormat Nevada, Inc. (Ormat). MDU/Ormat provide high levels of training in operating procedures, safety and emergency response. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency response procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the nearest fire department and request their assistance.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source\n\nThe power units are fueled by waste heat from a compressor turbine exhaust that is transferred from thermal energy into mechanical energy. This is accomplished by utilizing the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology. The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a Waste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat transfer fluid. The thermal oil is then circulated to the shell and tube vaporizer of an Ormat Energy Converter (OEC). The motive fluid on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive a special organic fluid turbine. This turbine, which rotates at 1800 rpm, drives a generator which pro"

After exiting the various heat exchangers, the thermal oil passes through the thermal oil surge tanks and the thermal oil feed pumps, which discharge it into the WHOH. MDU will utilize the generated electricity through its own interconnection with the existing electrical transmission system.\n\nThe basic Rankine cycle model consists of four components:\n1.    Pump -Work Input\n2.    Boiler -Heat Input\n3.    Turbine -Work Output\n4.    Condenser -Heat Rejection\n\nThe Rankine cycle consists of pressurizing a liquid (pentane), vaporizing the high pressure liquid, expanding the high pressure vapor and condensing the low pressure vapor for reuse. The energy necessary for the vaporization is provided by thermal oil at a maximum temperature of 572?F. The thermal energy is transferred to the pentane working fluid via tube and counter-current shell heat exchangers. The MDU CS-6 facility uses a commercial pentane with a dry cooling heat rejection system.\n\nPrimary Activities \n\nWaste thermal energy is converted to electric power. The net power output to the electrical grid is rated at 5.7 MW. Power output is reduced in warm weather due to limitations of the air-cooled heat exchangers.\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\n\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as a binary working fluid. Liquid pentane is pumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. Thermal energy provided by thermal oil is transferred to the pentane. The thermal oil heat input causes the pentane to change physical states from liquid to high pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric power. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to complete the Rankine cycle. A pentane storage tank is available for makeup. The facility design is segregated into multiple sections, each having its own design specifications dictated by the "

Each section is protected by pressure relief systems that may include pressure safety valves, pressure control valves, control system shutdown and intervention logic and administrative practices.\n\nQuantities Handled or Stored\n\nThe design inventory of the system consists of pentane present both as a gas and as a liquid. The nominal maximum liquid inventory exists when the facilities are not operating. At that time the energy in the pentane is reduced and most of the inventory is present as a liquid in the liquid recuperator vessels.

MDU CS-6 REG facility is located in a relatively isolated area surrounded by farmland (see attached graphic file -- CS-6Air.jpg). The facility is approximately 4.5 km east-northeast of Glen Ullin, ND.\n\nPrevention Program Description\n\nSafety Information:\n\nMaintenance procedures: MDU has installed and operates a Computerized Maintenance Management software (CMMS) program. This CMMS contains information on all equipment in the facility requiring maintenance, inspections, testing, certification, calibration, etc. NFPA, OSHA, manufacturer's recommendations and operations experience have been utilized to produce a comprehensive maintenance work order system that produces maintenance requests at appropriate frequencies. Employees report any equipment deficiencies to the operation and Maintenance Manager who generates \"work orders\" for the repair or assessment of the problem. Routine comprehensive inspections are performed using checklists.\n\nEmergency Response Plan: The emergency response plan is intended to identify and coordinate personnel in the event there is an emergency.\n\nTraining: Some equipment in the MDU CS-6 facility poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include electrical safety, fire prevention and protection, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, gas detectors, fire panels, personal protective equipment, and the safe use of tools and equipment."

If any of these events should occur, the monitoring staff will immediately contact the local Ormat Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manager and the MDU Regional Supervisor. If the O&M Manager is not reached in a timely manner the parent operating company, Ormat Nevada Inc., will be notified on the 24-hour phone number (775) 852-1912. Similarly, if the MDU Regional Supervisor is not reached in a timely manner then MDU will be notified on the MDU 24-hour phone number (800) 437-8000. If a fire is detected the monitoring staff shall notify local emergency personnel including fire and police departments.\n\nNotification of Northern Pipeline Personnel: Any Northern Border Pipeline personnel which may be at the site during the alarm condition must also be notified through Northern Border Pipeline procedures. Northern Border Pipeline personnel should not attempt to respond to the alarm conditions unless they have been trained and certified to do so. The principal methods of accident prevention include equipment design safeguards, written procedures and operator/employee training. Safety systems are present in the facilities and have various methods of operation.\n\nPressure safety systems typically have three levels of degree. The initial degree is an alarm that is presented audibly and visually to the Control Room Operator. The next more severe degree is a shutdown of process equipment likely to be causing or exacerbating the condition and an alarm that is presented audibly and visually to the Control Room Operator. The third and most severe degree of pressure safety system are pressure safety valves (PSV) which relieve to atmosphere or to larger low pressure systems. Som"

The policy for emergency response at MDU CS-6 is to mitigate any accident by implementing emergency procedures that have been developed for all known contingencies.
