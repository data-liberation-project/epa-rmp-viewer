      "SummaryText": "Background:\n\nWeyerhaeuser Company (formerly Willamette Industries, Inc.) owns and operates a pulp and paper mill located in Johnsonburg, PA (Elk County).  The mill manufactures approximately 1,000 tons/day of fine specialty paper and 700 tons/day of softwood and bleached hardwood pulp.  The mill has a 110 year old papermaking tradition and was purchased in 1990 by Willamette Industries, Inc.  Willamette Industries was then purchased by Weyerhaeuser Company in 2002.  The mill is subject to OSHA CFR 1910.119 requirements - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and is considered a \"Program Three\" facility under RMP.  A thorough review and evaluation of the mill's manufacturing process to determine threshold quantities of regulated substances was conducted related to these regulations.  As a result of this review Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) was determined to be applicable.  A PSM Plan was developed and implemented as required by the January 1, 1994 deadline by the Core Team members and its oversight committee.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on the covered process (Chlorine Dioxide) are required every five years on November 3-6, 2003 to revalidate.  The majority of action items identified during the PHA have been completed.  Those remaining action items requiring longer lead times and extended outages will be completed by 12/31/2004, except for one item scheduled for the second quarter of 2005.  A PSM compliance audit, as required every 3 years by 40 CFR 68.58, was conducted in May 2003. The next audit is scheduled in 2006.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies for the Stationary Source:\n\nChlorine Dioxide is generated at the Fiberline as the primary bleaching agent of hardwood pulp used in the paper manufacturing process.  The generation of Chlorine Dioxide at the Johnsonburg Mill is highly controlled process using an Eka Nobel SVP-HP system.  This system is technologically advanced as welll as one of the s"

Mechanical integrity requirements for the chlorine dioxide process include documented maintenance, inspection, testing and repair procedures intended to maintain a high level of operating efficiency and safety.  Additionally, regularly scheduled shutdowns of the Fiberline, bleach plant and Chlorine Dioxide plant are used to implement detailed equipment inspections and preventative maintenance to further minimize accidental releases.  The entire Chlorine Dioxide generation system is under a vacuum to reduce the possibility of Chlorine Dioxide decomposition and includes a fully automated emergency shutdown sequence.  Emergency response standard operating procedures have specifically been developed for the covered process to implement a safe shutdown.  Emergency off-site response notification procedures are posted in the Fiberline Control Room for the local fire department and Haz-Mat Team assistance in the event of a Chlorine Dioxide release.  These procedures are additionally a part of the mill's Preventive, Preparedness and Contingency (PPC) Plan.  The PPC Plan is intended to be an integrated facility plan designed to provide instruction during emergencies and is updated as needed to maintain accuracy.  The latest update being May 2004.  The mill's emergency response procedures contained in the PPC Plan, including the off-site response plan, has been periodically tested by county wide cooperative drills involving the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  The written emergency off-site response plan has been approved and incorporated by the LEPC as required by Section 303 of EPCRA.\n\n2.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nProcess safety management for the covered process of chlorine dioxide is the primary accidential release preventation program at the Johnsonburg Mill.  Implementation and enforcement of the PSM program elements is intended to ensure legal compliance with both PSM and RMP requirements and the safety of mill personnel and the community.  Chemical specific prevention steps include conducting regular comprehensive process hazard analyses to revalidate the process as part of the PSM program and completion of action items identified during the exercise.\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History:\n\nNo accidents were experienced in the five year history involving chlorine dioxide that meet the criteria listed in 40 CFR 68.42 (a).\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program:\n\nAs stated in Item 1, the primary emergency respone program for the Johnsonburg Mill is contained in the PPC Plan.  The plan incorporates all emergency scenarios and provides guidance for response to incidents in the RMP / PSM covered process of chlorine dioxide.  Additionally, off-site emergency response notification procedures are posted in the Fiberline control room in the event of a chlorine dioxide release.  The PPC Plan is included in mandatory mill personnel training and as stated above, is tested in cooperation with the Elk County LEPC.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe majority of the items from the PHA conducted on November 6, 2003 have already been completed.  The remaining items require longer lead times and extended outages will be completed by December 31, 2004, except one item that will be completed in the second quarter of 2005."
