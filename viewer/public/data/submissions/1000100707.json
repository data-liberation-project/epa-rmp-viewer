The plant is a merchant facility marketing the electrical power on the open power exchange market and ancillary service support to the California Independent Systems Operator (CAL-ISO) grid. The plant is located on a 38-acre parcel. \r\n\r\nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CalARP regulations, in one 26-ton steel bulk storage tank capable of holding 12000 gallons. The storage tank`s maximum fill is set at 85% capacity or 10200 gallons. Ammonia is used at the SEC to reduce NOx created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two combustion turbine generators (CTG) and heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) duct burners. Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the tow selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the SEC exceeds the federal RMP and CalARP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds and 500 pounds, respectively; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP and CalARP regulations.\r\n\r\nRelief valves: Pressure relief valves are located throughout the process system to protect against excess pressure. All process related factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the safety of workers and the integrity of the equipment. All liquid and vapor piping from the storage tank are equipped with excess-flow valves to stop the flow from the bulk tank in the event of an emergency. \r\n\r\nContainment Area: The ammonia storage tank is located inside a secondary containment area sufficient to contain the full contents of the vessel, 24 hours of rain fall as determined by the 25-year storm and deluge water for 20 minutes as determined by code.\r\n\r\nLeak detectors: Four ammonia leak detector transmitters are provided to detect major leakage and alar"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe Calpine Corporation's Sutter Energy Center (SEC) uses chemicals as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to the atmosphere. Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. As the company responsible for operating the SEC, Calpine Corporation takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe SEC accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendment of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, chapter 4.5. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment. The SEC has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\r\n\r\nThe SEC is located approximately 7.5 miles southwest of Yuba City, California in Sutter County.
