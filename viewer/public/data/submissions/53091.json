      "SummaryText": "3400 - LOUISIANA DEPT. OF ENVIROMENTAL QUALITY ID NUMBER\n\n\nThe Occidental Chemical Corporation (\u00bfOxyChem\u00bf) Geismar Facility (\u00bfFacility\u00bf) is subject to 40 CFR 68.  This facility is currently owned and operated by Occidental Chemical Corporation (\u00bfOxyChem\u00bf). \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \u00a7 68.155(a))\n\nOxyChem has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and the requirements of OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the plan requirements of the RMP rule.\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Geismar Facility in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care\u00ae and with the ACC Security Code.  As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances and emergency response programs. \n\nAdditionally, in the event a release should occur, the facility has an alarm system to alert personnel, a computerized dispersion modeling program to predict and track accidental releases, and an in house emergency response team trained to fight fires and control chemical releases.  The facility is electronically linked to the local emergency agencies and systems which include:\n\n1)\tGeismar  Area Mutual Aid organization;\n2)\tAscension Parish Hazmat Team;\n3)\tLocal Emergency Planning Committee; and \n4)\tSeveral community communications systems (comm"

As a part of this manufacturing process, OxyChem Geismar Facility uses several substances that are covered by the RMP rules.  These are chlorine, chloroform, methyl chloride, propylene oxide and vinyl chloride.  The Facility uses a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS (\u00a7 68.155(d))\n\nThe OxyChem Geismar Facility is designated as a Program 3 facility by the RMP rules.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Facility's Program 3 prevention program.  Each of the sections listed below are documented and maintained in several documents at the facility.  Each manual is updated regularly.\n\nThe Facility's prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\tProcess Safety Information\t\tPre-startup Review\t\tManagement of Change\n\tProcess Hazard Analysis\t\tCompliance Audit\t\tMechanical Integrity\n\tOperating Procedures\t\t\tEmployee Participation\tContractor Safety  \n\tTraining\t\t\t\tHot Work Permits\t\tEmergency Response\nIncident Investigation\n\nBefore using a hazardous substance at the Facility, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Facility, OxyChem reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance, which could adversely affect facility workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects."

      "SummaryText": "This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC), and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures, which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nThe production processes are designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Company, industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of production processes.  In addition, OxyChem requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.  OxyChem's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nFIVE YEAR HISTORY (\u00a7 68.155(e)\n\nThe Facility has had one release over the last 5 years that meet criteria for inclusion in the RMP report.  OxyChem Geismar conducted thorough investigations to identify and incorporate corrections to eliminate the root causes. \n\nThe incident involved a less than RQ chlorine release from the membrane chlorine Emergency Vent System.  Chlorine monitors located in the 230 kV yard and at the southern most plant fence line detected the chlorine release.  Chlorine gas was also detected at the Canadian National switchyard, located to the southwest of the plant, where a Canadian National employee received a minor chlorine exposure. The individual was sent to the hospital for observation but was returned to work on the same day.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (\u00a7 68.155(f))\n\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency response plan that is designed to protect employees, the public, and the environment.  The procedures include all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and other medical procedures, the use of emergency equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, evacuation plans, and community emergency"

      "SummaryText": "response notification procedures.\n\nProcedures for maintaining emergency response equipment are also contained in the emergency response plan.  There are procedures that address maintaining, inspecting, testing, and using the critical equipment needed during an emergency.  Employees receive periodic training for the duties they are expected to perform during an emergency.  A special radio system has been established between the Facility, all other chemical facilities in the area and the Sheriff's Office for the reporting and response to hazardous chemical incidents.  This coordination and communication ensures that the public is quickly notified, if necessary, and that action is promptly taken to minimize the consequences of a release.\n\nThe facility works through a local Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Committee and the Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness to establish redundant community warning systems for the residents of Ascension Parish.  These systems include: a 23 siren warning system for the areas immediately surrounding the chemical industry; a cable vision alert system which can alert all Parish residents who are watching the local cable network; an emergency broadcast system through a local radio station; and, a rapid dialing telephone alerting system that can contact 100 residents simultaneously.  These systems are maintained and upgraded by the Ascension Parish CAER Committee.\n\nThe facility regularly conducts emergency response drills so that all emergency response personnel are familiar with their duties during an emergency.  Additionally, the facility participates in local drills designed to test the preparedness and coordination of the Ascension Parish Emergency organizations and the chemical industry.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (\u00a7 68.155(g))\n\nThe key element of Facility\u00bfs safety and environmental programs is prevention, and the Facility tries to improve the safety of its processes through reviews of facility procedures, i"
