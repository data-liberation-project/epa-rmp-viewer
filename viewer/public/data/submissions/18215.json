If an emergency related to the chlorine system were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our on-site emergency response program.\n\nDescription of facility and regulated substances handled:  This facility is a sanitary and industrial wastewater treatment plant.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant.  Chlorine is stored in up to six (6) 1-ton cylinders, where a maximum of two (2) cylinders are connected to the system at any one time.  Johnsonville can also store up to fifteen (15) 150-pound chlorine cylinders.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:  The worst-case release scenario is the failure of one 1-ton cylinder resulting in a vapor cloud.  Using Exhibit 4-3 of EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 3 miles.  Off-site public receptors include a residential population of approximately 2600, and commercial, retail, and light industrial facilities within the City of Johnsonville and outlying areas.  Johnsonville's three schools, elementary, middle, and high, would also be within the worst case release impact area.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The facility has developed and implemented the requirements for a OSHA PSM Plan for the facility.\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our chlorine system, it is our policy to impliment our emergency response program.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: (1) replace chlorine gas detector, ("
