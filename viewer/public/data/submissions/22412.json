(LinPac) in Wilson, North Carolina. The purpose of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation is to prevent accidental releases of an identified flammable or toxic substance from a covered process, and to minimize the consequences of such a release of an affected substance. Owners/operators have a general duty under the regulation to identify hazards, design and maintain a safe facility, and minimize the consequences of releases of affected substances which do occur. If at any time a covered process no longer meets the eligibility criteria of its program level the owner/operator shall comply with the applicable new program requirements and update the RMP accordingly. The following paragraphs summarize an evaluation of LinPacs' general compliance with the stated Rule.\n\n40 CFR Part 68.155(a):\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe LinPac Process Safety Management (PSM) Policy requires daily inspections by maintenance mechanics and the Plant Engineer. Butane gas detectors are located in the Butane Storage Tank Area and at each high-pressure pump area near the back end of each extruder. These detectors are connected to a butane detection warning panel with lights and a warning horn. Butane pumps and motors are regularly rotated with their backups to verify proper working order and to allow for scheduled maintenance. \n\nThe general Emergency Response Plan (ERP) sequence is to call 911 for emergency response, sound the evacuation alarm and evacuate the building. If possible, the butane emergency shut-off will be activated and the power turned off to the butane motors. In addition as can be accomplished, equipment operators will turn their equipment off as they evacuate. Maintenance supervisors and lead oper"

A review of the Process Safety Management and Accidental Release Plan (PSM/ARP) elements as they relate to the RMP was conducted. This review indicated good overall compliance and excellent results, with no accidents related to the Butane System.\n\n40 CFR Part 68.155(b):\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe LinPac Wilson, North Carolina (LinPac) is a manufacturer of extruded, expanded polystyrene foam, plastic food handling products and building products. The food handling products include various plastic containers and trays such as meat trays and carry out food containers.  The building products are building insulation and insulation cavity integrity forms. \n\nFor the purposes of this regulation the covered process is defined as the butane storage and delivery system to the extruders, including the extruder die. Butane is used as a physical blowing agent in the manufacturing process and is stored on-site in an 18,000-gallon tank under pressure. Butane is the only regulated substance handled by LinPac.\n\n\n40 CFR Part 68.155(c):\nWorst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s):\n\nRMP requires that off-site consequences be considered in a hazard assessment process. An off-site consequence analysis was required to evaluate specific potential release scenarios, with a worst-case scenario and an alternative case scenario for the lookup tables found in the EPA guidance. No environmental receptors were identified for either scenario. \n\n\nThe worst case release scenario indicated a vapor cloud explosion would have an effect to a distance of 0.34 miles (1,795 feet). A receptor survey indicates that besides the LinPac facility, seven (7) active businesses, and ten (10) private residences could potentially be affected in this scenario.\n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario indicated that a vapor cloud fire would have an effect to 0.073 miles (385 feet).
