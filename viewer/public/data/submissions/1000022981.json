The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/ inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Matheson Tri-Gas facility is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

All other cylinder maintenance is performed by the chemical supply vendor. Each cylinder is equipped with a fusible relief plug which protects the equipment from overpressurization.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has had no accidents or releases of regulated substances from covered processes over the past five years (June 2006 - June 2011) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantities for each of the chemicals.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a release of a regulated substance, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM / RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.  To save lives.\n2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.  To protect the environment.\n4.  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chemical health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM / RMP regulations.\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas personnel circulate throughout the storage facility, taking note of unusual conditions.  In the event that a leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Matheson Tri-Gas Emergency Coordinator.  The Emergency Coordinator will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as"

As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia, chlorine, and hydrogen chloride.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled chemical release.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan as per 29 CFR 1910.38(a).\n\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the system and with the general safety and accidental release program at our plant.\n\nIt is the policy of this facility to devote the time, energy, and capital toward maintaining prevention and response programs appropri"

The facility is located at 2550 Kyle Crossing in Kyle, Texas.  The facility is situated approximately 0.1 miles west of Interstate 35.\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas is a chemical storage facility and stores the following regulated substances: ammonia, chlorine, and hydrogen chloride.  There is no process in which these chemicals are being used.  These chemicals are stored in cylinders of varying s.  The cylinders are delivered on pallets either by an outside vendor or intercompany trucks. The cylinder(s) remains onsite until it is purchased by a customer, at which point the intercompany truck picks up the cylinder(s) for delivery to the customer.  The facility stores the regulated chemicals in cylinders, which are located in the Storage Area by the Dock.  Each chemical is not mixed with other chemical cylinders.  The cylinders are transported on metal pallets by forklift to/from the delivery trucks.  \n\nThe maximum intended inventory for each of the chemicals is listed as follows:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia - 22,500 pounds\nChlorine - 6,663 pounds\nHydrogen Chloride - 6,844 pounds\n\nNote: The facility also maintains cylinders of arsine, dichlorosilane, nitric oxide, and sulfur dioxide, however the maximum intended inventories for these chemicals are below the EPA RMP thresholds, therefore they are not applicable to the RMP regulation.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas facility has implemented this Process Safety Management / Risk Management Program to manage the handling of the regulated substances. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. \n\nIn addition, Matheson Tri-Gas has developed a preventive maintenance"
