This plant was constructed by in the early 1980s and has operated continuously at the Elmendorf location since that time.  T-101, a new tank, was added to store formalin, a mixture of formaldehyde (37%), methanol, and water.  The formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of various products.\n\n\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to Clearwater because the plant now handles and stores formaldehyde in excess of threshold quantities.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n\n\n(1)  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause, ?112(r)(1), is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Clearwater is committed to ensuring the safe operation of its Elmendorf plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  Clearwater, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the plant and for the community by communicating with the Bexar County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\n(2)  Risk Management Plan - The batch specialty chemicals manufacturing plant involves the handling and storage of one chemical in excess of the threshold specified in ?112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of ?112(r), Clearwater management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of formaldehyde.  Programs have been established to prevent accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release, including maintaining a trained Integrated Prevention and Contingen"

To date, no accidents with offsite impacts have occurred at these facilities.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, Clearwater is subject to the OSHA PSM, EPA SPCC, OSHA HAZWOPER, EPCRA, and EPA RCRA Contingency Planning requirements.  Clearwater has also conducted a process hazard analysis on processes that use formaldehyde solution in water, referred to commercially as formalin. Clearwater has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Clearwter has active operatin, maintenance, training, and inspection preocedures; a trained Emergency Response Team and an evacuation plan for each area. In addition, Clearwater has communicated and coordinating response for site-specific chemical hazard information with the LEPC and local Emergency HAZMAT response team. \n\n\n\nClearwater's management is committed to the following:\n\n\n\n? Preventing accidents;\n\n? Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n? Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n? Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Clearwater operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n? Being a good corporate citizen of Bexar County.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about Clearwater's management of the risks associated with operating the batch specialty chemicals manufacturing plant.  Most important, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."
