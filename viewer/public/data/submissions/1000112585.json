The EPA has established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving the ammonia system.  The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24-hours of any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently.  Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learns from the incident and takes action to prevent similar incidents in the future.  Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.  No reportable incidents occurred at the Carrollton Water Plant during the 5-year reporting period (between 2004 - 2024) and at the present time for the current reporting period (between 2019 - 2024).\n\nES.10 Compliance Audits\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document.  The Chief of Operations must certify that the RMP Program team has evaluated compliance with the provisions of the Program, and verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.

Each Hazard Review has been reviewed and updated.  Progress made to date on the 2024 recommendations is provided.  \n\nES.5.1 Ammonia System Hazard Review\nThe hazard review for the ammonia system was conducted as an EPA approved Facility Audit.  Recommendations were noted on the Hazard Review found in Sections 1 and 5.\n\nES.6 Prevention Program\nBasic ammonia system operating procedures have been developed and documented by the Carrollton WPP and are provided in Section 6 and Appendix H.  They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the ammonia system.  Procedures include Start-up, Shutdown, Normal, and Temporary Operation.  Also included are Troubleshooting Procedures.\n\nES.7 Training\nTraining is required by the EPA to be included in the RMP Program.

The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining which Program Level (I, II, or III) the Carrollton WPP falls.  Residences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of Carrollton's Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I.  The Carrollton WPP is operated by public personnel and therefore excluded from Program III.  Carrollton WPP is included in RMP Program II.  The Hazard Assessment is provided in Section 1 and Attachment No. 5.\n\nES.1.1 Worst-Case Scenario\nThe WCS for the ammonia system (10,000 gallon tank) is defined as 10,000 gallons (51,500 lbs) of ammonia being released by a catastrophic event within a 10-minute duration.  This scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved RMP*Comp model.  The toxic endpoint for ammonia was determined to be 2.6-miles by the RMP*Comp model at the 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm) concentration specified by the EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries (ERPG-2).\n\nES.1.2 Alternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario of ammonia was also modeled using RMP*Comp.  An estimation of approximately 820 pounds of ammonia released was derived from the scenario of an outdoor piping failure.  The toxic endpoint for the ammonia system ARS was determined to be 0.1 miles.\n\nES.2 Five Year Accident History\nNo major accidents resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in-place, property damage or environmental damage have occurred between 2004 and February 2025.
