The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. \r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed. These corrective items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\r\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nTaylor Farms Foodservice conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\r\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\r\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nTaylor Farms Foodservice uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. \r\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage and produce pre-cooling, chilled water generation and produce processing. The refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system includes, screw and reciprocating type compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporative cooling coils surge drums, plate frame type water chillers, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. Portable systems are three vacuum cooling systems, one high side trailer and falling film water chillers. Each vacuum cooling system"

High side trailer contains one screw compressor, evaporative condenser and a high pressure receiver. \r\nThree vacuum cooling systems operate as stand alone systems while high side trailer and falling film water chillers operate connected to main systems. All of the vacuum cooling systems, high side trailer and the water chillers are removed from the facility at the end of each season\r\nFacility operates seasonally from approximately April 15 through November 15. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the system to the high pressure receiver during the off season. All of the portable systems, and main system screw compressors, condensers and make up water chiller systems are located outdoors. Mechanical room houses fixed system high press receiver, low pressure recirculator package and one reciprocated compressor. \r\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of emergency situation or any high pressure, high temp or ammonia detection . All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and mechanical room for alarming. There are assigned responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\r\nThe refrigeration systems at the facility were constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 46,400 lb \r\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are single-stage vapor compression cycles. \r\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritatin"

Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. \r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nTaylor Farms Foodservice maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. All of the relief valves at the facility and the vacuum cooling systems are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History\r\nAccording to Taylor Farms Foodservice personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years. \r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures.
