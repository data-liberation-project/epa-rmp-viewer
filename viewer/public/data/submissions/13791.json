Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nPD Glycol is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at PD Glycol.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The Plant's Emergency Response Team is reinforced with Personnel from the Beaumont Fire Department if needed.  We are also coordinated with The Sabine Neches Chiefs Association Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled.\nPD Glycol's primary activities encompass ethylene oxide which is converted into ethylene glycol.  We manufacture or utilize four (4) regulated substances at PD Glycol; ethylene oxide, ethylene, chlorine, and methane.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA using tables and equations has been employed by PD Glycol to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastropic release from the chlorine storage at the cooling tower of the ethylene glycol manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is releas"

Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastropic release from a failure of a cycle gas rupture disk in the ethylene oxide manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of 16,000 pounds of 50-50% ethylene methane mix.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.23 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release of ethylene oxide from a reabsorption column in the ethylene oxide manufacturing process.  The release is assumed to be an upset of the reabsorber column due to overpressure.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 8,610 pounds of ethylene oxide in 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as firewater monitors are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.99 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.09 mg/l.\n\nThe second alternative release scenario for a Program 3 toxic substance involves a relelasee of Chlorine from a chlorine cylinder due to a failure at the Glycol Unit cooling tower.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 730 pounds of chloring in 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as firewater monitors are taken into account to calculate the scenario.

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.06 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps.\nPD Glycol has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, (1967 Edition).  Two processes at PD Glycol are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the rellease prevention program in place at PD Glycol.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPD Glycol maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  This information is readily available to all employees including contractors.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nPD Glycol conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analysis is referred to as a unit PHA.  A complete, in-depth process hazard analysis is completed every five years by qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations as specified by OSHA's PSM standard.  Any finding related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, PD Glycol maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation s"

One incident occurred on September 22, 1995 when an operator was checking a compressor knock-out pot spilled approximately one pound of an ethylene oxide-water solution on the employee's foot.  There were no off-site injuries and no significant damage.  The second event occurred on August 18, 1998 when an operator was preparing a pump for maintenance repair and approximately 200 pounds of ethylene oxide in a 10% solution of water was released.  The event lasted for approximately 2 hours and 11 minutes.  A neighboring plant downwind elected to evacuate their one employee from the plant during the event as a precautionary measure.  There were no off-site injuries and no significant damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response\nPD Glycol carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  Our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPD Glycol continues to evaluate safety, health and environmental issues and to mitigate risk on an on-going basis as part of our on-going business driven improvement process for a safer plant and community."
