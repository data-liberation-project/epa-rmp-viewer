      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE\r\nPROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Huckabay gas plant has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety. This\r\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\r\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\r\nprocesses. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\r\nreleases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\r\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Huckabay gas plant, located in rural Erath County, Texas, operates a variety of processes\r\nto recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas. \r\nThe gas plant also recovers the regulated flammables, pentane and ethane. There are no\r\nthreshold quantities of toxic substances present. As such, The Huckabay gas plant is a Program 1 RMP facility.\r\n\r\nThe Huckabay Gas Plant is one of the many facilities operated by Enbridge G&P (North Texas) L.P. Natural gas streams enter the Plant and are separated into liquid and gas. The liquid stream is routed to the oil/condensate tanks and later loaded into trucks. The natural gas stream is then sent to a glycol dehydration unit. The natural gas stream is then sent to the amine unit. Following the amine unit, the natural gas stream is then stored within one (1) 30,000-gallon pressurized tank until it is sent offsite via pipeline. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Huckabay gas plant. \r\nBecause processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's\r\n(EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety\r\nand Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management"

This refresher training is conducted\r\nat least every three years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means\r\nused to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Huckabay gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased\r\nmaintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process\r\nequipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work\r\nin a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in\r\ntheir workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand\r\nand follow plant safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find\r\nduring their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview,\r\n(2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and\r\n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Huckabay gas plant evaluates\r\ncontractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant\r\npersonnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling\r\ntheir safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Huckabay gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that requires\r\na change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety\r\nfeatures, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to\r\nplacing the equipment into service.
