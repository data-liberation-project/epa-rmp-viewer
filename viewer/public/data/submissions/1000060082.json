Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in the audit. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each findings is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at BCS have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at BCS. Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nBCS has safety features on many units to help:\n(1) contain/control a release;\n(2) quickly detect a release, and;\n(3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters.\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Trained emergency response personnel.\n2. Personal protective equipment.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBCS has had no accidents within the past 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nBCS is a non-r"

The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. \n\nEmployees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. BCS has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e. Fire Department). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on various safety issues, such as flammable substances are held regularly. Employees are encourages and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards through Western Midstream's Near Miss and Observation programs."

These procedures along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nBCS has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. \n\nChanges are reviewed to:\n(1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards,and\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nBCS investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings are recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

The basic aspects of the program include, but are not limited to the following:\n(1) conducting training;\n(2) developing written procedures;\n(3) performing inspections and tests;\n(4) correcting identified deficiencies, and;\n(5) applying quality assurance measures.\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training:\n(1) overview of the process;\n(2) safety and health hazards;\n(3) applicable maintenance procedures;\n(4) emergency response plan, and;\n(5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nWritten procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. BCS incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operations procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nBCS has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nBCS primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards associated with the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. All approved mitigation options are tracked until completion. The final resolution of each findings is documented and retained.\n\nT"
