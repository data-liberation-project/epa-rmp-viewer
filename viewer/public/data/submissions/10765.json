      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Continental Natural Gas Shackelford plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public\nsafety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as\ntraining personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of\nour processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to\ncontrol and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Shackelford gas plant, located in Shackelford, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce\npetroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from natural gas. The\nShackelford gas plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. There are no\nregulated toxic substances at the Shackelford facility.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level\n3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the\nlargest storage tank containing 30,000 gallons (125,2000 lb). A written procedure is in place to limit\nthe storage inventory to 90% of the maximum tank capacity; therefore, the reduced inventory is\nassumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for\nthis WCS is 0.4 miles. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to\nmanage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in\nevaluating this WCS.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Shackelford gas plant is a\nVCE resulting from the release of 9500 gallons (39,600 lb) from a product loading pump. The release\nis expected to be isolated by the operators within 15"

This event was selected as being a practical\nscenario for use in emergency planning and response. Figure 1-1 graphically presents the hazard\nassessment results for the flammable WCS and ARS events.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Shackelford plant.\nBecause processes at the gas plant that are regulated by' the Environmental Protection Agency's\n(EPA's) risk management program (RAMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety\nand Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary\naddresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to\nimplement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Shackelford gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety\nmanagement and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and\ncompiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process\nhazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant\naccident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention\nprogram are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and\naddresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of\ninitiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives\ninclude forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have\nmembers from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant\nmanagement.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Shackelford gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\nopera"

Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility\nfor maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents\nand their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help\nemployees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). The gas plant ensures\nthat the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring\ninstruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown\nsystems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design\nand construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination\nwith written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and\nmaintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that\nsafety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Shackelford gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with\nthe various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage\nthese hazards.\n\nThe Shackelford gas plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to\nperform these evaluations.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the\nhighest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team\nfindings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and\nretained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly\nfrom the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard\nanalysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted\nat this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator\nto learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills\ndemonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own,\nthey can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the\noperating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\nThis refresher training is conducted at least every three years.

Gas plant personnel\nperiodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety\nobligations.\n\nPro-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Shackelford gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires\na change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features,\nprocedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the\nequipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in\naccordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The\nPSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification\nthat accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Shackelford gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels,\npiping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown\nsystems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting\ntraining, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting\nidentified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel,\n(2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing\nmaintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or\nequipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control sparkproducing activities (i.e., hot work),\nand (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a\nconfined space.
