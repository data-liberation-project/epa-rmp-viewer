Safe Operating Procedures\n\n    Written operating procedures are prepared for all processes at the facility, including those using Ammonia and Propane. The operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities in the plant. Procedures are updated to reflect current operating practices, and are certified annually for accuracy. \n\n    Specific information and instructions covered by operating procedures include startup, normal operation, emergency operation, shutdown, operating limits, operating controls, chemical-specific health and safety information, required personal protective equipment, and use of safety systems. Written Safety procedures are also provided for specific operations such as Hot Work, Lock-out/ Tag-out, Confined Space Entry and Line Breaking.\n\n\n\nd.
