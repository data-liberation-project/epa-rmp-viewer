Feed stocks and products are shipped into and out of the facility via tank trucks and rail cars. The plant has approximately 135 employees and operates 24 hours per day. There are two chemicals at the Farmers Valley plant that are subject to the RMP regulation; anhydrous Ammonia and Propane. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is a toxic colorless gas with a strong pungent odor. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to cool feedstock to the Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone (MEK) Unit. The normal maximum inventory of Ammonia is approximately 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nPropane also is a colorless flammable gas at atmospheric temperature and pressure. It has a vapor density of 1.52 (air = 1). Propane is used as a solvent to remove heavy resins from the vacuum tower bottoms in the Propane De-Asphalting (PDA) Unit. The normal maximum inventory of propane is approximately 190,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3)    The General Accidental Release Preve"

Safe Operating Procedures\n\n    Written operating procedures are prepared for all processes at the facility, including those using Ammonia and Propane. The operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities in the plant. Procedures are updated to reflect current operating practices, and are certified annually for accuracy. \n\n    Specific information and instructions covered by operating procedures include startup, normal operation, emergency operation, shutdown, operating limits, operating controls, chemical-specific health and safety information, required personal protective equipment, and use of safety systems. Written Safety procedures are also provided for specific operations such as Hot Work, Lock-out/ Tag-out, Confined Space Entry and Line Breaking.\n\n\n\nd.    Training\n\n    Employees involved in operating processes using Ammonia and Propane have received training to ensure they have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the requirements specified in the written Operating Procedures. Refresher training is provided every two years at a minimum, or sooner if warranted by changes to operating conditions, equipment or procedures. If refresher training is required more frequently than every two years, it will be triggered through the Management of Change process (described below). Training records are maintained for each employee to show the date training was conducted, the material covered by the training, and the means used to verify that the training was understood.\n\n\n\ne.

Management of Change (MOC)\n\n    A Management of Change form is generated when there is a change (except for replacement in kind) to equipment, process chemicals, technology, procedures, or a change to the facility that will affect a process that handles Ammonia or Propane. Work orders for such changes pass through the Safety Department and Engineering to ensure the proposed change is carefully evaluated before implementation (e.g. to assure that proper materials of construction and good engineering practices are employed). Engineering will make changes to the P&ID's to keep the Process Safety Information up to date. Operations and Maintenance personnel are trained prior to start-up of a modified process.\n\n\n\ng.
