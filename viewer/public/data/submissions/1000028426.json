There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as with the Tri-County Fire & Rescue Department in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\r\n\r\n2.0\tProcess Description and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Holland Energy facility is a 650 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant located in Shelby County, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe design of the facility incorporates a 2-on-1 configuration, 650 MW (nominal) combined cycle plant that includes two single-fuel (Natural Gas) combustion turbine generators (CTG's), each linked to a supplementary-fired heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), producing steam to drive one common condensing steam turbine generator (STG).  The plant is designed to operate in base or peaking load conditions with natural gas as the primary fuel.  Currently, no back up fuels are planned.\r\n\r\nThe project site is located in Holland Township, Shelby County, Illinois directly north of the Shelby and Effingham County lines. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 221112.  The facility is capable of producing power that is then distributed.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored on-site to provide ammonia vapor to control NOx emissions at each of the facilities two (2) HRSG stacks.\r\n\r\nThe Holland Energy plant has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used to control NOx in the HRSG stacks (DENOx System).\r\n\r\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is 54,350 pounds with administrative controls.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to the Holland Energy facility in Beecher City, IL.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\tWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nThe ammonia storage tank has as"

Although the alternative release scenario is more probable, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated chemical. Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated chemical.\r\n\r\nAmmonia \r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\r\n\r\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\r\n\r\n1.\tIrritation of respiratory tract,\r\n2.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\r\n3.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\r\n\r\nBelow is a description of the release scenarios for ammonia and their off-site consequences:\r\n\r\nWorst-case scenario - the largest potential release of ammonia will occur with a puncture in the high-pressure ammonia storage tank located on the Northwest side of the plant. The total quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the tank is 54,350 pounds with administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity of 54,350 pounds is released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nUnder Section 68.25(c) (1), a regulated toxic substance such as ammonia, which is normally a gas at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure, shall be considered to be released as a gas over a 10-minute period.  Thus, ammo"

The endpoint is defined by the US EPA as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level - 2 (ERPG-2) which was calculated to be 4.0 miles.  The ERPG-2 was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association and is applicable to human exposures for up to one hour.  The ERPG-2 is intended to protect individuals from health threatening or escape impairing injury and is not generally considered fatal.\r\n\r\nRural dispersion coefficients were used during the modeling runs for the Holland Energy facility in accordance with Appendix W to Part 51 - Guidelines on Air Quality Models Section 8.2.8.\r\n\r\nThe estimated affected residential population is 1110 people.  The types of affected receptors are listed in EPA's RMP*SUBMIT.\r\n\r\n\tAlternative Release Scenario - This scenario is more likely to occur than the worst-case release.\r\n\r\n\tThe alternative release scenario is an ammonia gas release through a pressure relief valve (PRV) on the ammonia storage tank, which is located at the Northwest side of the plant. The actuation of the PRV will produce a vertical jet release.  There is no applicable administrative control or passive mitigation associated with the PRV. Active mitigation of the release is human intervention (PRV is shutdown at 10 minutes from the start of the release).  The release rate of ammonia from the relief valve failure is calculated to be 461 lb/min.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia alternative scenario was modeled using EPA's RMP*COMP to obtain the distance to endpoint.
