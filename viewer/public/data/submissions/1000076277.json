      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Saint Jo Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nCopano Field Services/North Texas, LLC owns and operates the Saint Jo Gas Plant located in Montague, Texas. The gas plant receives produced natural gas via pipeline. Residue gas is removed from the plant by pipeline. The hydrocarbon liquids are fractionated at the Saint Jo Gas Plant and the fractionated products are shipped out via pipeline. The Saint Jo Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity. Based on process knowledge, Copano identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. There are no listed toxic substances stored above threshold quantities at the Saint Jo Gas Plant. Listed flammable substances stored above threshold quantities include methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutene, isopentane and pentane. \r\n\r\nThe Saint Jo Gas Plant has not had an accidental release in the past five years and emergency response procedures have been coordinated with the Montague Fire Department and the Sheriff's Office.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Saint Jo Gas Plant. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulations are also subject to the Occ"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and\r\ncompiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas\r\nplant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas\r\nplant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and employee safety issues.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Saint Jo Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).

The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). Also, the gas plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe Saint Jo Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The gas plant primarily uses the HAZOP/What If analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by the report written by the PHA team. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding"

To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Saint Jo Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations,(4) emergency\r\nshutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. These procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Saint Jo Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.
