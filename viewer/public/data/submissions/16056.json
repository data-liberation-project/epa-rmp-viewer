The gas is received in ton-containers and dissolved into water using vacuum feed chlorination with leak detection.  A gas detector and alarm system is connected to an automatic telephone dialer.  Two people unload a delivery truck with crane hoist, an approved lifting device.  Empty chlorine containers are exchanged by a team of two operators.  Self-contained breathing apparatus is available on-site.  The Hanover Fire Department has a one-ton container repair kit \"B\" for use at facility.  Hanover Fire Department is the delegated first-responder and uses an emergency response plan developed by the Adams County LEPC  as a result of SARA III and EPCRA reporting.  The release risk management program in place at the facility ensures that all equipment, including process and safety equipment, is in excellent working condition.  A callout list assures that there is round-the-clock coverage of operations at the facility.",

      "SummaryText": "a.       The Borough of Hanover Municipal Authority owns a  potable water treatment system and distribution system for the Borough of Hanover, county seat for Adams County, Pennsylvania, and for some surrounding communities.  This system is operated by the Borough of Hanover.  The water treatment plant located at 235 Old Hanover Road  processes up to 11 million gallons per day of water drawn from the South Branch Conewego Creek  to yield potable water.  Treatment processes include pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, fluoridation, and chlorine disinfection.  Chemicals are also added to control taste, odor, and corrosion.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, every day of the year.\n\nb.       The water treatment plant includes a chlorination room, which contains two (2) one-ton cylinders of chlorine liquified under pressure, a chlorinator, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  The chlorinator system uses remote-vacuum-actuated feed lines and has high pressure regulators attached directly to the chlorine vessel gas valves, mitigating against high-pressure gas releases through the chlorinator system.  Water treatment operators regularly check the room and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the rate as necessary.  The maximum intended inventory is 8,000 pounds.\n\nc.       The off-site consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, one \"worst-case\" and one \"alternative-case.\"  The first scenario is defined by the regulations as the \"maximum quantity in the largest vessel\" being released \"as a gas over ten minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative-case scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\"\n\n          Atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using the RMP*Comp program distributed by the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention "

This model determined the distance traveled by the chlorine released until its concentration decreases to the\"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 ppm, (0.0087 mg/L,) which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2, defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\n          The worst-case release scenario at the Hanover Water Treatment Plant involves a failure of one of the two chlorine containers, or a 2,000 pound release.  The off-site consequence analysis was performed under the prescribed EPA conditions of all volume released as gas within a ten minute period, to an ERPG-2 endpoint radius of 1.3 miles according to the RMP*Comp model.  Within the 5.4 square-mile area bounded by this circle reside 746 people who may potentially be affected by the release.\n\n          The alternative-case scenario chosen involves a leak from a rust-hole in one of the vessels, as defined in the RMP Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  No mitigation was considered.  The RMP*Comp model was run assuming a 13.33 minute duration release at 150 pounds per minute from a quarter-inch rust hole in the liquid portion of the cylinder, which yielded a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles and an area of eighty acres surrounding the facility.  The meteorological conditions used were taken from the Guidance to be stability class D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  Approximately 19 people would be affected by this release.\n\nd.

No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf.       The facility has an emergency response program which has been reviewed and coordinated by the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Gettysburg and by the Hanover Fire Department and the Adams County HAZMAT Response Team.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills have been conducted with the fire companies, and the operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated on a regular basis.\n\ng.        Changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were made following a May 4, 1999, inspection of the disinfection systems by the Borough's consulting engineer.  These recommendations included third-party training of all water plant employees in chlorine usage and safety, done on June 2, 1999,  improvement to written emergency operating procedures, and the installation of a security system to detect the presence of smoke or heat and to prevent unauthorized entry."
