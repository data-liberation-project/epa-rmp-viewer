It is considered an integral part of every task we perform.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE:\nFully loaded tank car with 160,000 pound capacity\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\nFailure of ammonia tank car resulting in loss of 160,000 pounds of ammonia. This worse case scenario has off site impacts.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO:\nFailure of loading valve on tank car resultuing in loss of 60,000 pounds of ammonia.This release scenerio has off site impacts.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PEOGRAM:\nThe Savannah ammonia terminal is subject to OSHA's PSM regulation.  Established safety and operating procedures provide a system to reduce the potential for accidental releases. Pre and Post loading inspections are conducted on each unit prior to shipment.  Weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual inspections provide a system to locate potential problem areas.  A work order system is in place to formally notify maintenance of any problems.  Any noted condition is tracked until completion.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nNo accidental releases have occured in excess of the 100 pound Reportable Quantity in the last five years from a covered process at the terminal.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nPCS Phosphate has in place a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) designed to address prevention, preparation, response, and recovery f"

The terminal, its employees, and business are susceptible to emergencies such as natural disasters, severe weather, and man-made hazards.  The CEMP, in conjunction with the Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management standard aid in the prevention and management of potential emergency situations.  PSM is more closely alligned to prevention through the use of process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Employee Involvement, and Management of Change Procedures.\nThe CEMP has six basic elements; Basic Plan, Prevention, Preparedness, Response, Hazard Specific  Procedures, and Recovery.\nThe use of Safety and Operating Procedures provide a system to reduce the potential for accidental releases by focusing on specific components of each shipment and process.  The safety and operating procedures manual consists of 16  safety procedures and 4 operating procedures uniquely designed for specific job tasks.  The manual is reviewed annually and revised as necessary to address any needed changes or recommendations.  Each and every outbound shipment receives a pre-loading and  post loading inspection by the loading technician.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the terminal. Periodic evaluations and inspections are performed on a routine basis to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations at this time."
