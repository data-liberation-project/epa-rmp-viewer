This release would affect approximately 9,560 residents,schools,a hospital,a prison, recreational areas, indusrtrial office areas, and an environmental receptor - a wetlands.  The possibility of this worst-case scenario occurring is quite unlikely as the railroad tank car is placed in a protected/shielded area of the facility and these railroad tank cars are periodically inspected according to Department of Transportation requirements.\n\n\nb.The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release of Anhydrous Ammonia from a break in a 2 inch transfer hose, during the unloading procedure, with the release discontinued in 2 minutes.  The calculated quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia released would be 7,100 pounds.  The distance to an end point of 200 ppm of Ammonia as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degadis - is 0.56 miles.  This release would affect 635 residents, some majior commercial, office and industrial areas and an adjacent wild life sanctuary.  The possibility of this alternate release scenario occurring is extremely unlikely as Lebanon Plant personnel periodically inspect, repair, and replace involved equipment according to standard operating procedures. \n\n4.The general accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of safety requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 - published by the American National Standard Institute, Inc.; the standard of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29CFR1910, 111 - storage and handling of AnhydrousAmmonia; and OSHA 29CFR1910,119 - process safety management standard.\n\n5.The five-year accident history:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or property damage on site; nor, to our knowledge, have resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in pla"

      "SummaryText": "1.Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe owners and senior management of Lebanon Chemical Corporation established an Environmental Policy on February 12, 19993.  The management and the employees of the Lebanon Plant of Lebanon Chemical Corporation have been instructed in and subscribe to this policy and are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia at the Lebanon facility.  If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel are prepared to work with the Lebanon County Emergency Planning Committee, The Avon Fire Department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary activity at the Lebanon facility of Lebanon Chemical Corporation is the manufacture of fertilizers for sale to the lawn and garden user (homeowner) and the professional market as golf courses.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, generally by railroad tank cars or occasionally, by tanker trucks, stored; and used from the storage tank in the manufacture of mixed-grade fertilizers for plant nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored at this facility would be 290,000 pounds (130,000 pounds in a 30,000 gallon storage tank filled to 80% capacity, which is a facility policy, and 160,000 pounds contained in a loaded railroad tank car).  This maximum storage would only happen in rare circumstances.\n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n\na.The worst case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of Anhydrous Ammonia from a fully loaded railroad tank car released as a gas in a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia released would be 160,000 pounds which is the capacity of the railroad cars ordered and supplied by the vendors.

A written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR1910,38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities, and the fire department the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA),\n\nc. a written response program in accordance with the OSHA standard 29CFR1910,120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training. \n\n\nThis facilities' Emergency Response Program has been reviewed by the Lebanon County Emergency Planning committee and is incorporated in the Lebanon County Emergency Response Plan.  A copy of this plan is available for review at the Lebanon County Emergency Management Agency by appointment.  An annual ammonia leak drill is carried out on site by site personnel, Lebanon County Emergency personnel and Avon Fire Company personnel.\n\n7.Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the Lebanon facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and conditions.  There are no additional specific Anhydrous Ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
