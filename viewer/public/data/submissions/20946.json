      "SummaryText": "Wayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass is a poultry processing facility that stores and uses a chemical that is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  This chemical is Ammonia for refrigeration.  We currently have maximum storage capacity of 20,000 pounds of Ammonia at the Pendergrass facility.\n\nWayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass believes this RMP chemical that we store and handle on site has very real and potential dangers.   However, it is important to keep the risks in perspective.  Wayne Farms-Pendergrass's ammonia storage and handling facilities:\n1.  are properly designed\n2.  have effective operation and maintenance procedures\n3.  employ trained operators and technicians\n4.  have periodic safety audits, and\n5. are constantly upgrading its process to meet or exceed industry standards\n\nWayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass also has taken a proactive approach towards coordinating emergency efforts with the Jackson County Fire Department.  Jackson County has a copy of our emergency response program and is well trained and prepared to respond to the potential spills and leaks that may occur at the Wayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass facility.  The Voluntary Jackson County Fire Department also conducts annual site visits to our facility.\n\nA facility which maintains high standards, such as Wayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass, provides less public risk than a facility that does not provide safe operations.  Wayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass complies with Federal OSHA rules and guidelines for safe handling, storage and operation of ammonia systems.  We also utilize outside ammonia system experts to periodically inspect our systems integrity, train system operators and upgrade systems to improve safety.  As a result of Wayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass's safety program, Wayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass has had no releases of ammonia which resulted in any off site injury or illiness in the past five years.\n\nBecause of the large quantities of ammonia Wayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass maintains on site, there is a v"

      "SummaryText": "ery small probability that there could be off-site consequences if a major leak occurred.  Wayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass uses EPA's OCA Guidance for off-site consequence analysis of ammonia.\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (20,000 pounds in 10 minutes), a 2.2 mile radius around the Pendergrass facility may have to be evacuated.  According to 1990 Census Data, 1070 people in the surrounding community may have to be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.  \n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nDuring the past five years Wayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass has had several small releases of ammonia to the atmosphere.  The largest of these small releases was approximately 500 pounds, which occurred as a result of a leaking high pressure pipe.  This 500 pound release was used to determine an alternative release scenario, which would result in a release of ammonia that may travel .2 mile and should not reach the general public.   \n\nCONCLUSION\nWayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform the public of the potential dangers and the actions that Wayne Farms has taken to minimize these dangers.  Wayne Farms LLC - Pendergrass (the #1 employer in Jackson County) has a long-great ongoing relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Jackson County."
