      "SummaryText": "The Swiss American Sausage facility produces cured meats at our facility located in Lathrop, CA. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. \n\nThe Manager of Plant Engineering is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. \n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health \nAct's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements: \n\u0095\tEmployee Participation Program\n\u0095\tProcess Safety Information\n\u0095\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u0095\tOperating Procedures\n\u0095\tTraining Program\n\u0095\tContractor Safety Program\n\u0095\tPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\u0095\tMechanical Integrity Program\n\u0095\tHot"
