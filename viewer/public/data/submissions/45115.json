      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared for Marchem Technologies, LLC (Marchem) facilities at 20851 South Santa Fe Avenue, Long Beach, California in accordance with the requirements of the California Code of Regulation (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 (California Accidental Release and Prevention Program [CalARP]).  \n\nMarchem manufactures surface-active agents (surfactants) and has an SIC Code of 2843.  Seven state regulated acutely hazardous materials are used, handled, or stored for manufacturing processes above the State Threshold Quantity (STQ):  acrylamide, dimethyl sulfate, epichlorohydrin, ethylene oxide, isopropylamine , propylene oxide, and toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers).  Processes handling these substances were determined to be eligible for Program 3 requirements.\n\nA Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Team was established by Marchem to conduct HAZOP studies and Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs).  Since the most recent RMP submission, all previously conducted HAZOP studies and PHAs were reviewed and updated to incorporate recent process changes and modifications at Marchem\u00bfs facilities.  The HAZOP Team consisted of the SH&E and Maintenance Manager, SH&E Engineer, experienced process operators, and experienced facility maintenance employees.  Additionally, the plant manager, president, and laboratory staff were often consulted during the Process Hazard Analysis processes as well.  The guideword approach was used in conducting HAZOP studies and PHAs to identify hazards.  Identified risks were assessed for likelihood and severity. Using the risk matrixes listed within each study, risks were evaluated as being acceptable, acceptable with controls, undesirable, or unacceptable.  Based on each evaluation, remedy action issues were identified, discussed, and recommended for implementation.  A copy of each updated PHA is located in Appendix B.\n\nThe HAZOP Team also conducted an External Events Analysis.  The following external even"

Missile impacts that may result from extreme winds, high summer temperature, lightning and seismic activity were found to present the greatest risk with undesirable or unacceptable consequences.  Details of the analyses and risk evaluation along with resulting recommended actions are provided within each Process Hazard Analysis.\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analyses were conducted for nine release scenarios to evaluate human health and environmental impacts associated with an accidental release.  Each release scenario considered the most conservative conditions that would result in the greatest off-site impacts.  The toxic substance worst case scenario as defined by Section 2750.3 of CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, is the release of the maximum stored quantity of ethylene oxide in storage over a period of ten minutes .  This was chosen as the tank car release, since the storage tank is passively mitigated by location as an underground storage tank.  The second worst case scenario, as defined by Section 2750.3 of CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, involves isopropylamine, a flammable liquid in a vapor cloud explosion.  Based on air dispersion modeling using average meteorological conditions, seven alternative accidental release scenarios were identified during the HAZOP studies and/or external event analyses.  These release scenarios involved: a) the spill of acrylamide in the drum storage area as a result of a forklift accident b) the rupture of the dimethyl sulfate conveyance line to the process area, actively mitigated by operator in charge of process whenever system is running; c) the spill of epichlorohydrin in the drum storage area as a result of a forklift accident; d) the rupture of the ethylene oxide rail"

These release scenarios were determined by the HAZOP Team to be likely and credible, being associated with either the compounded failure of administrative process controls, mechanical integrity, safety systems, or a serious external event.\n\nA detailed description of all incident categories that could have involved the seven acutely hazardous materials processed at the Marchem chemical manufacturing facility during the past five years is provided in Section 3.0.  During this period there have been no reportable incidents at Marchem in the following categories:  personnel injury or illness relating to exposure to any of the RMP covered processes , environmental release, and community exposure beyond Marchem\u00bfs property boundary.\n\nMarchem\u00bfs Risk Management and Process Safety Management Program is included in Appendix D.  It includes all programs relating to Training, Maintenance, Audits, Incident Investigations, PHAs, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permits, Confined Space Entries, Respiratory Protections, Preventative Maintenance, and Contactor Safety.\n\nMarchem has prepared, maintains, and conducts periodic training of its Emergency Action Plan.  This plan describes the procedures by which an emergency response is handled by the management team and operators at Marchem.  All employees at Marchem, including on-site contractors, are periodically trained on the Emergency Action Plan.  Additionally, th"

A detailed discussion of the plan is provided at Section 5.0 and a complete copy located in Appendix E.\n\nCurrent recommendations to improve facility safety stemming from the most recent Process Hazard Analysis include: inspect the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide check valves regularly, ensure valve numbers are specifically referenced on all procedures, mount a retractable airline hose reel on top of the EO/PO offloading platform for easier access, and install an overhead lamp for better visibility during evening EO/PO offloading activities, and place toluene diisocyanate transfer hoses on a three year change-out PM.  These items are being reviewed for proper implementation."
