              "Description": "   This process, as well as all of the other processes on this site, is a batch process, in which all reactions are carried out in a stirred tank, batch  reactor.                                                                                            The hazardous material associated with this process is dimethylamine (DMA), in which the largest amount is stored in a pressure vessel rated at 250 pounds per square inch guage pressure (psig).  Normal  storage pressure of DMA is 75 psig, far below the tank pressure rating. The tank is protected from an overpressure, that might rupture it, by the installation of rupture discs and safety relief valves.             During the loading of the DMA storage tank, a closed loop piping system is employed to recycle the DMA vapors back to the delivery truck while the DMA liquid is being pumped into the storage tank. The DMA storage tank is permanently grounded, and the delivery trailer is temporarily grounded during the unloading process to prevent static electricity buildup and sparking that could cause combustion of a hydrocarbon. The delivery truck driver and plant operator are present during the unloading process to make corrections that might be required to assure the safe unloading of DMA. The truck driver and plant operator assigned have both been schooled in the safe handling of DMA.                                                                                                            The DMA storage tank is located in an approximately 60 ft. X 34 ft. X 45 in. high diked area.  A water deluge system is in place around the tank and can be remotely operated to supress any excess emissions that might result from any tank, piping,or equipment leak within the containment dike. The pumps used to transfer the DMA from the storage tank to the batch are also located in the containment area. An excess flow valve is installed in the line from the tank to the delivery pump that will activate and shut down the flow of DMA in case of a line rupture or any excessive DMA flow from the storage tank. A check valve is also installed in the reactor delivery line to prevent contamination of the DMA in the storage tank.                                                                                                                  The reactor is a water jacketed, stirred tank, pressure vessel. The water jacket is used to control the reactor temperature, which helps control the reaction and reactor pressure. The reactor mixer shaft contains a double mechanical seal to prevent leakage of gases and liquids from the reactor. The reactor is also protected from overpressure by rupture discs and safety relief valves. The reactor is vented to the plant scrubber system to control emissions that might occur during the reactor filling cycle.                                       A safety shower and emergency eye wash are located in the immediate reactor area and are also located in the truck delivery area.                                                                                                                 The operators and supervisors are trained to to prevent any unsafe operation of the complete process.  The personnel and supervisors are also trained to  implement emergency response  procedures in case of an emergency.                                           Routine maintenance procedures are documented and implemented. A mechnical  inspection of  the process and safety equipment was conducted initally and is conducted annually  to insure mechanical integrity and correct any deficiencies that might be discovered..",

              "Description": "   The hydrogenation process is also a batch process,  where basic chemicals are reacted in a pressurized, stirred tank reactor, like all of the other batch reactors on site, to produce a product. The listed chemicals for this process are ammonia (NH3), hydrogen (H2), and acrylonitrile (C3H3N).                                                The largest quantity of each listed chemical on site is in its respective storage tank.                                                                              The batch reactor is protected from a catastrophic rupture, caused by an over pressure situation, by safety relief devices. The reactor is vented to the plant scrubber system when it is being loaded or depressurized to prevent excess emmissions to the atmosphere. Nitrogen (N2) is used to purge the reactor of oxygen (O2)  to prevent a flammable mixture that might be ignite. A safety shower, eyewash and protective equipment are located near  the reactor. The C3H3N storage tank is a 250 psig rated pressure vessel. N2 is used as a blanket in the tank to prevent O2 from coming into contact with the C3H3N vapors.  Without O2, the C3H3N vapors can not be  ignited. The tank pressure is also controlled by the N2 to 125 psig, well below the pressure rating of the tank.  Safety relief devices venting to atmosphere protect the tank from catastrophic rupture by an unlikely overpressure situation. The piping and tank, like all of the vessels and piping on site, were inspected prior to being placed in service  and are inspected on an annual basis.    A remotely controlled water deluge system is constructed around the storage tank. The storage tank is also located in a diked area that is large enough to contain the contents of the tank and deluge water, should such a situation occur. A closed loop vapor recycle system is used to fill the tank .                                                                      The NH3 storage tank is also a 250 psig rated pressure vessel with relief devices installed to prevent a catastrophic rupture of the tank. An excess flow valve is installed between the tank and piping. Should a pipe line rupture or NH3 is fed too fast to the reactor, the excess flow valve will shut automatically within one second to prevent a major release of NH3 to the atmosphere. A closed loop vapor recycle system is also used for delivery of NH3 to the storatge tank.                                                                                    The H2 storage tank is a refrigerated vessel kept at  -427 degrees F.   H2 pressure at this temperature is   14.7 psig. This tank also has safety relief devices to prevent catastrophic rupture of the tank. The tank is also insulated to assist in the control of the H2 temperature.  Should the refrigeration system malfunction,  the release of H2 from the  safety relief device  ( along with the tank insulation) will keep the H2 in the tank cold enough so that only small quantities of H2 are released at one time.                                 All  plant operators, supervisors and truck drivers are trained to handle their respective chemicals in a safe manner and are prepared to handle emergency situations that might arise.                 A formal maintenance reporting and action plan is in place to correct, in a timely manner, any leaks or equipment malfunctions that might occur on this process or any other process at this site.",

              "Description": "   Like all of the other described processes, the Quat process is a batch process operation using a stirred tank, pressure reactor  with a double mechanical sealed mixer shaft. The reactor is protected from catastrophic rupture caused by overpressures by safety relief devices. Nitrogen (N2) is used to purge the reactor of oxygen (O2) prior to filling. The reactor pressure and temperature, like all of the batch reactors on site,  are contolled during the reaction by a reactor cooling water jacket and by  the controlled addition of the reactive chemicals. The reactor is vented to its own quench system that consists of a pressure vessel containing the relatively inert liquid mixture of amine bottoms and isopropyl alcohol that will be charged to the reactor for the next batch reaction. This quench vessel is closed to the atmosphere, and any vented reactive chemicals from the reactor will react completely with the contents of the vessel.    The listed chemicals for this process are methyl chloride (MeCl) and trimethylamine (TMA).  MeCl is stored in a 250 psig pressure rated vessel that  is equipped with pressure relief devices to prevent  a catastropic rupture of  the tank. The ambient  pressure of MeCl does not exceed 75 psig, which is well below the pressure rating of the vessel.  The tank is located within a diked area and is surronded by a remotely controlled deluge system.  A firewater monitor is also located outside the diked area to help cool down the tank and control  MeCl emissions, if required.                                            The tank is loaded from a tank delivery truck using a closed loop vapor recycle system, as described in previous processes, to minimize emissions to the atmosphere.  Like all other chemical deliveries,  the delivery truck contents are matched to the storage tank contents by the plant operators to make sure  that  the delivered chemicals are loaded into the correct storage tank. The truck delivery hoses and connections by both the truck driver and plant operator for potential leaks. Prior to coupling, the truck brakes are set, and the wheels are chocked to prevent movement. The truck is grounded to prevent static electricity buildup and discharge. The plant operator and truck driver remain with the truck during the unloading proceedures.                                              The TMA is stored in the railroad tank car in which it is delivered.  The pressure rating of the railroad tank car is 350 psig, and and the tank car is approved by the Department of Transportation (DOT) for safe transportation of TMA.. The pressure relief device on the car is set at 280 psig to prevent a catastrophic rupture of the  tank.  N2 at 70 psig is used to blanket the TMA and to transport it to the reactor.  The N2 is also used to purge the reactor of O2 and  the delivery lines of TMA between and the tank car when the batch reaction is completed. An excess flow valve is installed on the railroad tank car to shut down the flow of TMA should a major leak develop in the TMA piping or should the feed rate to the reactor be too high.                                                                                                 When the railcar is spotted: the wheels are set; ; the wheels chocked;  the car grounded;  and a derail block is placed at the head of the tracks. \" Dry-Link \" hose couplings are used to connect the railcar to the plant piping and to prevent spillage of TMA when connecting or disconnecting the railcar to the plant piping. Like the delivery trucks, the hoses and connectors are inspected for leaks. Protective gear is used by plant personnel during this procedure. A safety shower and eyewash is located in this area. Self contained breathing units are readily available, if required.        Plant operators and chemical truck drivers are trained and experienced in the safe handling of their respective chemicals and are trained to handle potential emergency situations before they get out of hand.     The storage vessels, reactors and piping are inspected and tested before being placed in service and are inspected for mechanical integrity on an annual basis there after. Like the rest of the processes reported, the formal maintenance program is applicable to this process.",
