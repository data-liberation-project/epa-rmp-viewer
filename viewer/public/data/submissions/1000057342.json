EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION 68. 155\n\n\n\nThe City of Frederick Utilities Department operates the Linganore Water Treatment Plant at 6436 Plant Rd., Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland.  This plant is one of four water plants operated by the City.  The City also operates one wastewater treatment plant.  The Linganore water plan and the Monocacy water plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemical, anhydrous chlorine, above the EPA and OSHA thresholds.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the Linganore Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.  \n\n\n\n1.1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\n\nThe City of Frederick Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program as well as Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) 22-CFR-1910-119 under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  \n\n\n\n1.2.  MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\n\nThe City of Frederick has a management system in place which is led by the City's Mayor, who delegates implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements to the Public Works Department Deputy Director.  The Deputy Director delegates the RMP program to the Utilities Assistant Deputy Director who has responsibility for water treatment plant operations and RMP Program implementation.  The City organization chart defines the RMP program lines of authority.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organization chart that def"

PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\n\nThe City of Frederick maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Linganore Water Treatment Plant.  The program address each of the EPA's RMP Level 3 Program listed 12 elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the plant's OSHA PSM program.  The City is in compliance with both.  These documents are maintained and implemented by City of Frederick's Water Treatment Superintendent and by the City's Health and Safety Manager.  \n\n\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe City of Frederick Linganore Water Treatment Plant employs 21 full-time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations.  The Water and Sewer Division maintenance staff services the various water plants.  Chlorine is used as part of the water treatment process.  \n\n\n\n2.1.  SITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)\n\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Frederick and managed by its Public Works Department.  The site is located at 6436 Plant Rd., Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland.  The site is located in a forested area, boarded by the Linganore River on the west.  \n\nThe plant includes a separate chlorine storage feed room and adjacent chlorination control room which also houses the injection feed distribution system.  The chlorinated water feeds various injector points in the plant.  \n\nChlorinated water beyond the chlorine control room is outside of the boundaries of this RMP process.  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage Room and the Feed Control and Chlorination Control Room, associated vent makeup, exhaust systems and chlorine injection units in the Chlorine Control Room area that support the system"

All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.  \n\n\n\n2.2.  REGULATED SUBSTANCE (B) (2)\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The City of Frederick chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Maryland Department of Environmental Protection (MD DEP).  \n\nThe chlorine is received and stored in one-ton containers.  One container is in operation and a second on standby.  Chlorine from a container is then distributed to four process control systems.  \n\n\n\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  Chlorine is an oxidizing agent that is non-flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling 15-minute permissible exposure limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe.  The immediately dangerous health and life hazards (IDLH) level is 10 ppm.  The lethal concentration (LC-5O) is 250 ppm.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.  \n\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is ten  (10) one-ton containers.  This equals 20,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the plant, the public and environmental receptors surrounding the plant.  For chlorine, the distance to the endpoint concentration of the gas was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios:  a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\".  The City maintains a Five-Year Accident History for the WTP chlorine system (See Sectio"

The first is a \"worst case release\".  The second is a more probable \"alternative release\" scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".  This scenario was defined by the Process Hazards Analysis team in a PHA meeting.  \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.  \" The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals three ppm.  The three ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"  \n\n\n\n3.1.  WORST CASE (C) (1)\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPA's RMP Comp air dispersion program.  Data and assumptions used were:\n\n?    A gas is liquefied under pressure\n\n?    A one-ton container releasing 2,000 lbs.\n\n?    Quantity released 200 lb/minute\n\n?    Duration of release is 10 minutes\n\n?    No mitigation measure\n\n?    Topography: urban surroundings (many structures in area)\n\n?    Wind speed 1-5 meters/second\n\n?    Stability Class F\n\n?

There are residences and other receptor sites included in that release area (schools, commercial facilities and parks) (Data is in PSI).  \n\n\n\n3.2.  ALTERNATIVE CASE (C) (2)\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the regulator of the pressure system or the pipes/valves connected to one of the ton containers.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 0.01 square inch hole in the whip tube, a pipe, or even the container itself.  Modeling using the EPA/RMP Comp and EPA's guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 31.7 lb./minutes for a period of 30 minutes.  The toxic endpoint distances were determined using the following assumptions:\n\n?    A gas is liquefied under pressure\n\n?    31.7 lb/min release\n\n?    Quantity release 951 lbs. \n\n?

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D)\n\nThe City of Frederick accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM/RMP programs have been effectively used for many years.  They are part of the plant's operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D) (1)\n\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\n\nThe City of Frederick has detailed process safety information on each of its operations.  \n\nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  This system is computer based.  \n\nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous, toxic properties and effects of all chemicals used.  \n\nMaintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment.  The maintenance program uses a computer based work order system for scheduled mechanical integrity as well as for unplanned repairs and maintenance.  Incident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure we learn from each event as well as correct the causes of the incident.  \n\nIf there is a chlorine release, significant injury, or property damage or near miss with catastrophic potential, an investigating team is formed (within 48 hours) and reviews the incident.  A determination report documents the occurrence, causes and any remediation actions needed.  \n\nEmployees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed below under Emergency Response.  Employees are also Safety Committee members, Process Hazards Review members, Accident Investigation Team members as well as having input to and development of the various P&Ps.  Safe work practices are used throughout the facility including:  1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lockout/Tagout Perm"

Chlorine-Specific Operating Safety Information\n\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include: the policies and procedures listed above and those of the chlorine specific program.  These include:\n\n\n\n4.2.2.  Specific procedures for the management of the chlorine process\n\nThere is a specific procedure for the Completion of a Management of Change for all modified and/or new processes.  This is followed by Completion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to startup of the modified or new chlorine system.  There are specific emergency response procedures for chlorine releases as outlined below under both operating procedures for small releases and in the emergency response procedures for large releases.  See the Emergency Response Program manual.  There is specific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for chlorine.  Operators and maintenance staff are trained to the Operations Level HazMat Responder level.  Finally, the details of both facility and equipment design are in the operations manual of the chlorine system.  \n\n\n\n4.2.3.  Facility Design\n\nThe chlorine storage room and chlorination control room are located within the chemical building.  The plant and support equipment of the chlorine storage building and adjacent control room meet and exceed design codes, standards and good engineering practices.

The alarm system is tied into the security system which alerts management.  Finally, the chlorine alarm starts the chlorine room ventilation system.  The plant has an emergency generator which enables the electrical instruments and equipment to function during a power supply outage.\n\n\n\n4.2.4.  Equipment Design\n\nThere are two types of chlorine systems, high pressure and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine container and piping system is very short as it only includes the ton container valves on the ton containers and yoke assembly and vacuum pressure regulator.  These parts are made of anhydrous (elemental) chlorine compatible materials; steel, copper or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is 150 psig giving a three-to-one safety factor.  \n\nEach ton container has six fusible plugs that release chlorine if their temperature is 150 to 170 degrees F.  There is one, one-ton container on line, and one, one-ton container on standby.  There is an automatic switchover within the vacuum pressure regulator.  The low-pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of below 13 inches of mercury.  A pressure relief valve vents if the pressure in the line reaches over several inches of positive water pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine and water compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.  A chlorine monitor detects the presence of chlorine in both the ton storage area and in the chlorination control room.  \n\n\n\n5.

The plan includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  The plant also has site-specific emergency actions for small and large (reportable) releases defined in the plant's Operating Procedures and Emergency Response Plan.  Emergency response drills and evacuations are conducted annually.  \n\nEmergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.  The emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the water plant Safety Committee, the City Safety Coordinator City Fire and Police Departments.  The water plant and Fire Department coordinates with Local Frederick County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Frederick County HazMat Team.  All are located in Frederick County, Maryland.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments.  Besides the specifics of the prevention programs, they are incorporated in the operating culture of the City water plant and Maintenance Department that services the plant.  \n\nThe Emergency Response or Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators, mechanics and staff.  All operators and mechanics are trained to the EPA HazMat  Operations Level for response to leaks.  The primary response team includes the Frederick County Fire and Rescue, and Frederick County HazMat Teams.  All of these respond to severe chlorine leak situations.  Actions include response to: catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine \"B\" Leak Repair Kit is maintained at the chlorine storage area to aid in stopping leaks.

CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (G)\n\nChanges to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in the internal safety HazOp, tour, and audit of the RMP program to meet requirements of the Risk Management Prevention Program.  These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implemented as required.  Another major change was made to improve safety in 2005 and the installation of four more security video cameras in 2013.  Audits were conducted to review the RMP program in 1999, April 2005, May 2010, October of 2014, December 2017 and February 2020.  The key safety action items were completed.  See the \"Update\" Section 6 of this report.  The City of Frederick continually reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the City of Frederick management team and process safety team are reviewing potential upgrades to the existing design of the chlorine operations to make the system even safer in order to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of chlorine.  \n\nThe City of Frederick Water Treatment Plants compiled the EPA-required Vulnerability Assessment (VA).  Recommendations from the VA Report improve site security and safety overall including that of the chlorine system.  \n\nThe plant has conducted RMP Awareness training, "
