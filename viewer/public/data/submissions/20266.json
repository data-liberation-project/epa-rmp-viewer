              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR BROMINE  Tank Truck and ISO Container Unloading       One  45,000-pound tank truck or one 40,000-pound ISO container is unloaded at a time, with prevention against movement  and with constant operator attendance.  The contents are transferred by 20 psig of nitrogen pressure into the enclosed and diked storage tank, with relief valves on both the tank truck or container and the storage tank.  In the event of leakage, the operator would remotely close a valve to stop the flow fromthe shipping container.  Bromine would immediately sink below water which fills the unloading containment pad.  This would totally suppress any vaporization.   Bromine Storage Tank       The 77,250-pound storage tank and the 10-GPM transfer pump are fully enclosed and diked to contain any leakage and for protection against vehicles, fire, and solar heating.  Several inches of water are maintained in the storage dike to suppress vaporization in the event of leakage.  A caustic scrubber is connected to the storage enclosure and would absorb any Bromine vapors in the enclosure.  It is also connected to the storage tank when it is being filled.      Bromination Reactors       The two 2,000-gallon bromination reactors (K18 and K-29) are protected with 3-inch-diameter, 38.5-psig rupture disks.  The bromination reactions are mildly exothermic, and the heat of reaction is removed by cooling water flowing through the reactor jackets.  A high-temperature alarm is provided to warn the operator if the operating conditions are not within the proper ranges.  Process-Safety Program       All operators have been thoroughly trained in startup, normal operation, shutdown, and emergency procedures.  Equipment is maintained according to a preventive maintenance schedule.  Emergency plans have been developed and have been tested by running drills each year.  All employees are knowledgeable concerning the potential hazards of Bromine.  The reaction processes have been subjected to intensive process hazards analysis, with periodic updating.  Any changes to the process are studied for possible safety implications, prior to the change.  Details of the process safety information, process hazards analysis, and risk and consequence analysis are available in reports dated 1990 and 1995.",

Any leakage from the tank truck would fall into the water filled unloading pad, where it would be substantially diluted.  This would stop any vaporization.       Nitric Acid Storage Tank       The 5,000-gallon glass-lined storage tank and the 10-GPM transfer pump are within a full-containment dike, for protection against leakage and vehicles.    A water scrubber absorbs nitric-acid vapors during storage-tank filling.  Nitric Acid Weigh Tank       A 2,500-pound weigh tank receives nitric acid from the storage tank via transfer pump, for pump delivery at very low rates to the nitration reactor.  During weigh-tank filling, nitric acid vapors pass to a water scrubber.  A relief valve protects the weigh tank from overpressure and discharges to a water scrubber.  A remote-operated valve stops flow from the weigh tank.  Nitration Reactor       Flow of nitric acid to the K-9 nitration reactor is maintained at a constant low rate, with an interlock shutoff if the temperature goes outside a narrow range.   Nitrations are strongly exothermic, and the heat of reaction is removed by automatically-controlled flow of cooling water or cold brine through cooling coils and the reactor jacket.  High-temperature and high-pressure alarms are provided to warn the operator if the operating conditions are not within the proper ranges.  Water from the fire-main system provides back-up for the normal cooling water supply.  A 4-inch-diameter rupture disk provides protection against runaway reaction (oxidation).",

              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR OLEUM  Tank-Truck Unloading       One tank truck containing about 40,000 pounds of 20 weight-percent oleum (\"104.5%\" sulfuric acid) is unloaded at a time, with prevention against movement and with constant operator attendance.  The contents are transferred by 35 psig of nitrogen pressure through a 1-1/4-inch Teflon/SS unloading hose and 2-inch stainless-steel piping into the diked storage tank, with a relief valve on the tank truck and an open vent (through the adjoining 98%-sulfuric-acid tank) to the atmosphere.  In the event of leakage, the operator remotely closes an automatic valve to stop the flow from the tank truck.  Water from hoses would be used to dilute any spilled oleum, to retard release of sulfur trioxide.  Oleum Storage Tank       The 7,500-gallon stainless-steel storage tank is within a full-containment dike, for protection against leakage and vehicles.  The tank contains a submerged 50-GPM 22-psig pump, for transfers to the K-23 sulfonation reactor.  Sulfonation Reactor       Flow of oleum to the K-23 sulfonation reactor is manually controlled by the operator in response to indications of temperature and weight, by starting and stopping the oleum pump.  The reaction is essentially endothermic, and the heat required by the reaction is provided by the flow of hot oil through a jacket around the sulfonator, as supplied by a hot-oil system.  High-temperature and high-pressure alarms are provided to warn the operator if the operating conditions are not within the proper ranges.  A 4-inch-diameter 35-psig rupture disk provides protection against overpressure.  At the conclusion of the reaction, the temperature of the sulfonator contents is reduced by the flow of cooled oil circulating through the jacket.  Process-Safety Program       All operators have been thoroughly trained in startup, normal operation, shutdown, and emergency procedures.  Equipment is maintained according to a preventive maintenance schedule.  Emergency plans have been developed and have been tested twice each year.  All employees are knowledgeable concerning the potential hazards of oleum.  The reaction process has been subjected to an intensive process hazards analysis.  Any changes to the process are studied for possible safety implications, prior to the change.  Details of the process safety information, process hazards analysis, and risk and consequence analysis are available in a report dated June 1999.",

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPfister Chemical is committed to protecting the public, employees, and the environment while producing chemicals that are important to industry and providing employment for its employees.  This Executive Summary describes the processes that are used at this facility and the precautions that are taken to prevent the escape or release of noxious materials.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Pfister plant occupies the area between US Route 46, the Overpeck Creek, and the north-south CSX Rail tracks, in Ridgefield, New Jersey, and consists of nine buildings, including administrative offices, a laboratory, and the Number 7 process building of interest.  In this building, the regulated chemicals - Bromine, Nitric acid, and Oleum - are used in four reactors.  Although these are reactive and toxic materials, special procedures and controls are used in their handling and processing.  As a result, there have been no serious incidents involving any of these materials since they were first used at the plant.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nOleum is stored in a 7,500 gallon tank, in a concrete diked area which has sufficient capacity to hold the entire contents of the tank as well as several inches of rainfall.  The vapor pressure of Oleum is so low that in the event of a rupture of the storage tank,  the distance that could be reached by any vapors would be only 1100 feet (0.2 miles).  Such an incident would be considered a \"worst-case\" scenario.  \n\nOleum is received in tank trucks that are approved by the U. S. Department of Transportation [DOT], having capacities up to 45,000 pounds.  It is theoretically possible that a transportation container could rupture.  However, at the Pfister site, \"passive\" mitigation of tank truck releases would occur since any spilled material would run into a trench system which is partially filled with water.  Since Oleum is miscible with water it would be immediately diluted and any vapori"

Department of Transportation [DOT], having capacities up to 45,000 pounds.  It is theoretically possible - but highly unlikely (because of the construction and safety devices) - that a transportation container could rupture.  However, at the Pfister site, \"passive\" mitigation of tank truck releases of Bromine is provided, in the form of a water-filled \"drowning pit\" beneath the tank truck being unloaded.  Since Bromine is almost three times denser than water and is not miscible with water, any spilled Bromine would fall through the water, and the \"supernatant\" water layer would prevent vaporization of Bromine.  \n\nThis \"drowning pit\" would also minimize the vaporization of spilled Nitric acid, which also is unloaded at this location, since Nitric acid is very soluble in water.  Any spilled acid would be substantially diluted down to a strength that would not produce vapors.  \n\nAn alternative scenario would be failure of the 3,000-gallon Bromine storage tank, but this tank also is \"passively\" protected by being installed within a 13-foot-by-17-foot dike having a capacity of 4,500 gallons and within an enclosure (that is \"actively\" exhaust-ventilated to a caustic scrubber).  A layer of water is also maintained inside the dike,  so any spilled Bromine would sink beneath it and any evolution of vapors would be prevented.  \n\nComparison of the consequences of these scenarios, in terms of the distances attained by the \"Toxic-Endpoint\" concentrations, indicates that failure of the diked Oleum storage tank would be the \"worst-case\" scenario for this site.  \n\nA \"worst-case\" release could affect nearby businesses.  To determine the consequences of the \"worst-case\" release, the USEPA \"Offsite Consequence Analysis [OCA] Guidance\" is used.  Use of the OCA \"Toxic-Endpoint\" tables leads to the conclusion that a concentration of 0.01 milligram per liter could occur "

Nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour to this concentration without experiencing or developing irreversible or serious health effects or symptoms.  \n\nThe USEPA also requires that the total number of persons resident within a circle having this 1100 foot radius be estimated.  There are not known to be any residences within this potentially affected area.  \n\nAmong the safety features which are provided to prevent the occurrence of the \"worst-case\" (or other) releases are full-time attendance by operators during unloading; devices to prevent overpressurization of the storage tanks or the tank trucks, excess-flow shutoff valves; a \"drowning pit\" under the tank-truck unloading spot for Bromine and Nitric acid; Bromine-leakage detectors; remote-controlled shutoff valves; diking of the storage tanks; water-sprinkler protection against fire exposure to containers; and systems to control temperatures, pressures, container levels, and flows.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe USEPA also requires that consequences of \"alternative\" release scenarios be evaluated, such as leaks from piping or other equipment for each of the regulated materials.  With the close control of storage, transfers, and processes, such releases are unlikely and would be stopped promptly.  As a result, it is unlikely that the safety of the public, the environment, or employees would be affected by Pfister operations.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs\n\nOperations involving Bromine, Nitric acid, and Oleum (sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid) at the Pfister plant are regulated by the \"Process Safety Management\" standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and by the \"Accidental Release Prevention\" standard of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency.  To comply with these standards, Pfister follows strict guidelines for operating procedures, training of employees, analysis of process"

In addition, the Pfister facility has been involved in the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act [NJTCPA] program since its inception in 1990.   There have been annual reviews of the regulated processes, annual inspections of the facility by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, and two process-safety audits by an independent consultant since that date.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving release of Bromine, Nitric acid, or Oleum in the past five years.  The most-recent incident occurred on September 3, 1992, and involved the release of about 1/2 pound of bromine from a pump (in the storage-tank dike) which was believed to be empty.  An employee was injured when some of the Bromine entered a glove, but there were no off-site effects.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAs a part of the NJTCPA program, the Pfister facility has conducted emergency-response drills every year since 1990.  Most of these drills have involved the Ridgefield Police and Fire Departments, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Bergen County Hazmat and the Mid Bergen Mutual Aid Group as well as employees who are trained to recognize and respond to the simulated emergency situation and to activate shutdown and other protective systems.  Annual tours are arranged for members of the Fire Department, to show the locations of the unloading and storage facilities and fire protection systems.  A weather station is maintained on-site, to provide information to local authorities regarding the protection of occupants of residences and business establishments in the downwind direction.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAdditional containment will be provided around the Nitric acid storage tank.  There will be improvements made to the Bromine storage,  and extra containment provided.  \n"
