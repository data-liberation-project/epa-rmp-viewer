The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Anhydrous Plant in Jackson are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Jackson Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 84,118 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank. Product will be received by tanker trucks which typically hold 50,000 pounds.  The facility has \nTwenty-one 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that when filled would hold \napproximately 91,035 pounds.  There are seven 560 gallon tank applicators that would hold approximately 16,993 pounds.  Therefore the facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 192,146 pounds.   \n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will work to meet the newest codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuatio"
