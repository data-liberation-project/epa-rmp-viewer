Liquid Propane (if released at atmospheric pressure) can refrigerate steel pipes and tanks down to temperatures of 44 F.\r\n\r\nThis 18,000-gallon storage tank was manufactured by Trinity Industries Inc. in 1980. Specifications are as follows: Serial Number 113272\r\n\r\nShell thickness:0.672\r\nHead thickness:0.384\r\nOutside diameter:109.344A\u00bf\r\nOverall length:54.391A\u00bf\r\nMax volume:18,253 gallons\r\nWeight:29,677 pounds\r\nSurface area:1186 Square Ft.\r\nThis tank is equipped with two 2A\u00bf diameter 250-psi relief valves. Both valves are vented through 2A\u00bf diameter risers equipped with rain caps. Liquid levels are taken with the Roto-Gauge with dial and dip tube for a 108A\u00bf inside diameter tank. A temperature probe is installed in the opposite end. The tank is painted reflective white in order to minimize heat accumulation from the sun\r\n\r\nOver-pressuring of the delivery system is avoided by the use of bypass valves. If the delivery hose is closed while the pump is activated, propane is bypassed back to the pump inlet until downstream pressure is relieved by opening the hose delivery valve.\r\n\r\nThe propane storage tank was installed in accordance with guidelines obtained from the Railroad Commission of Texas and the equipment manufacturer. The utilization of explosion proof fittings, switches and remote control panel insures compliance with local electrical codes. Loading and unloading lines are equipped with A\u00bfSnappy JoeA\u00bf and A\u00bfPull-AwayA\u00bf valves which, in conjunction with remotely operated spring-loaded manual valves, protect this system from drive away releases. Should a release occur, the lack of public receptors in the immediate area of the storage tank limit the exposure to the public. It is likely that any propane released will be dissipated by the prevailing north-south winds before leaving Upham property.\r\n\r\nHAZARD REVIEW\r\n\r\n1.

      "SummaryText": ", due to expansion, venting may occur through the pressure relief valves. Any release is subject to fire or explosion and should be avoided. Overfilling is avoided by and through inventory control. Prior to ordering the delivery of propane, the exact amount on hand is confirmed by use of the rotary gauge. Office personnel determine that the amount ordered will not exceed storage available. Prior to unloading the transport, quantity on hand is again checked with Upham personnel and the transport driver present. Temperature and amounts to be delivered as well as inventory on hand are recorded. After delivery, levels and temperature are again checked and recorded. \r\n\r\n2. Vandalism-Tampering with the propane delivery system could result in injury of personnel or property. Tampering is controlled by locking valves and hoses used for propane transfer. The electrical system is disconnected after normal work hours by a time clock disconnect. Additional protection is provided by security lighting which is on from dusk to dawn.  Finally, A\u00bfNO TRESPASSINGA\u00bf signs have been installed.\r\n\r\n3. Pull-A-Way Hose Failure-It is possible for persons delivering or loading propane to drive away without disconnecting delivery hoses. The installation of a pull-a-way valve assembly in the loading hose will limit the amount lost to the liquid inside of the valve assembly. In addition, a pneumatic system will close the A\u00bfSnappy JoeA\u00bf valve at the bulkhead. Transport delivery is protected by the use of a block valve and one way check valve located at the bulkhead as well as a spring-loaded remote valve with manual actuator located near the storage tank. Once detected, the flow of propane can immediately be curtailed or eliminated. The bulkhead system is designed to fail above the cutoff valve and one-way check valve, which will remain intact.\r\n\r\n4. Equipment failure- All hoses are protected by at least two cutoff valves.

Any items requiring maintenance or replacement are reported to the Upham Office.\r\n\r\n5. Acts of God- The geographical location of this facility has no history of earthquake, flood or other natural occurring disaster. The system is well grounded, sealed and therefore protected from lightning strikes. No roads are near the storage tank or bulkhead delivery system. Damage due to loss of control of a vehicle is unlikely.  Grass and weeds are controlled and not allowed to grow near the propane system thereby reducing the possibility of fire.\r\n\r\n6.

Corrective action can be taken to control the event.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nInventory.   Monthly inventory readings are taken and reporterd to the Upham Office.

If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Bridgeport and Chico Fire Departments and local law enforcement agencies. The proper authorities will then activate our emergency response plan including evacuation and isolation if necessary.\r\n\r\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of the 18,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPAA\u00bfs look-up tables, the distance to the one-psi overpressure endpoint is .3 miles. There are an estimated 5 private homes, 1 office buildings, 2 rock quarries within the blast radius. The total population within the blast radius is estimated to be 50 persons.\r\n\r\nThis facility is a refueling station for Upham Oil & Gas Company vehicles that utilize Propane as a motor fuel. Equipment on site includes an 18,000 gallon pressurized storage tank, transfer pumps, associated piping and refueling station.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPAA\u00bfs accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local regulations. The propane system was installed in 1980 under the supervision and inspection of the Railroad Commission of Texas. The equipment has been upgraded, repaired or replaced as necessary to comply with state and local regulations.  Most recently in June of 2004, a new bulkhead and emergency shutdown valves have been installed to comply with the Railroad Commission of Texas.  The emergency shutdown valves can be activated 50 feet from the propane tank. The valves limit product escape to the fueling hoses in case of a drive-away and/or severed  hose.\r\n\r\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response plan had been discussed and is on file with the Bri"

Upham employees will react only in a defensive manner to a major release.\r\n\r\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario. Total failure of the 18,000-gallon propane storage tank when filled to the maximum amount allowed could result in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint is .3 miles. See Executive Summary for details.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario. A more likely event would be a A\u00bfPull Away ExplosionA\u00bf resulting from the driver failing to remove the transfer hose prior to moving the vehicle. In this scenario, the failure involves a 25 ft. length of 3-inch diameter unloading hose. The active mitigation devices (excess flow valve) and check valve are assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. The release leads to a vapor cloud explosion (end point 1 psi). The quantity released is 39 pounds. The distance to the end point is .027 miles or 145 feet.\r\n\r\nSAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nPropane is a gas at normal temperatures and pressures. It is liquefied by storing it in a closed container at pressures higher than its equilibrium vapor pressure. There is a direct relationship between ambient temperature and the pressure inside the storage container. As the ambient temperature increases, the pressure of the container increases proportionately. According to NFPA 58, 1998 edition, Table B-1.2.1, commercial propane when heated to a temperature of 105 F will produce a pressure of 210 pounds per square inch, gauge (psig). NFPA 58 Edition, Table 2-2.2.2 sets the current minimum design pressure for an ASME tank at 250 pounds per square inch, absolute (psia). This design allows for a maximum vapor pressure of 250 psia at 125 F. The discharge piping for pumps and compressors is currently designed to 350 psi and vapor piping is designed for 250 psi according to NFPA 58, 1998 Edition, 3-2.10.2. The minimum tem"
