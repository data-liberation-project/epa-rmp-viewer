This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  This facility, commissioned in August 1988, was designed and constructed utilizing generally accepted industry codes and recommended practices such as ANSI American National Standard Institute, ASME American Society of Mechanical Engineers, TEMA - Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association, and API American Petroleum Institute.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plans have been developed to control and contain such a release.\n\n    \n\n    DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    \n\nThe Willard CO2 Separation Plant is located in a rural area four (4) miles North of Denver City, Texas.  Denver City has a 2000 census population of approximately 3900.  Denver City is located in West Texas approximately 90 miles South of Lubbock, Texas and 90 miles North of Midland, Texas.  The plant processes a wet (H20) carbon dioxide rich (83% CO2) gas stream to produce a dry CO2 rich (86% CO2) natural gas stream for use in tertiary oil recovery projects in the immediate area.  Natural gas liquids (NGLs), sulfur, and hydrocarbon condensate oil are also produced from this process.  The plant has several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.  The Willard CO2 Separation Plant current capacity is 90 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD).  Current plant throughput averages 90 MMSCFD of raw gas from various West Texas tertiary oil recovery projects. \n\n\n\nThe CO2 rich/wet gas stream is compressed, dried, and sep"

The compressors and the other rotating equipment are electrically driven except for the emergency electrical generator and firewater pump, which are diesel engine powered.  The natural gas fired equipment includes: boilers, glycol re-boiler, gas heaters, plant flare and other combustion sources which burn sweet natural gas purchased from outside sources. \n\n\n\nAfter the first and second stages of compression, the entire feed gas stream goes through a triethylene glycol (TEG) dehydration system to remove water from the gas stream.  Lean TEG absorbs the water and small amounts of hydrocarbon from the gas stream.  The rich TEG flows to a flash tank, where the hydrocarbon gases are released and returned to the plant inlet for re-processing.  From the flash tank, the TEG is regenerated using a direct-fired re-boiler.  The water vapor and hydrocarbon separated from the glycol are condensed.  The oil and water are subsequently separated from each other.  The oil is sold and the water is used for injection in a nearby tertiary oil recovery project.In 2006, a fuel gas recovery unit was installed just downstream of the Ryan-Holmes process, to recover fuel gas from the CO2-rich residue gas.  This unit produces fuel gas for internal use and for outside sales, increasing Willard Plant efficiency, and producing a more desirable residue gas for reuse in tertiary oil recovery.  The cryogenic process uses a compressor and CO2 fractionation column to process about 60 MMSCFD of residue gas, producing about 8.7 MMSCFD of low-BTU fuel gas.  As part of this project, a molecular sieve unit was installed to enhance water removal capabilities from the Ryan-Holmes feed gas.\n\n\n\nAfter the gas is dehydrated it enters the Ryan-Holmes process, a patented lean oil absorption gas separation process, that separates the CO2, nitrogen, and methane from the H2S and NGLs.

The 86% CO2, rich residue gas leaving the Ryan-Holmes process is compressed to higher pressures.  The majority of this gas is mixed approximately 50/50 with third party pipeline CO2 for use in nearby tertiary oil recovery fields.  The remainder, though not mixed, is also used in a nearby tertiary oil recovery field.\n\n\n\nThe CO2/H2S sour NGLs from the Ryan-Holmes process are sweetened with a diethanolamine (DEA) system.  Lean DEA removes hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and the remaining CO2 from the NGLs.  The now rich DEA is regenerated in the amine re-concentrator by adding heat (via steam) to drive off the CO2 and H2S.  The CO2 and H2S from the re-concentrator are routed to the sulfur recovery unit (SRU).  The sweetened NGLs extracted from the DEA process are stored in pressurized tanks, then pumped and sold through a third party pipeline. \n\n\n\nIn the SRU, H2S is converted into elemental sulfur.  This molten sulfur is stored in a vessel until it is shipped out in insulated trailers and sold.  The waste gas from the SRU is then incinerated.  Supplemental gas is added to the incinerator to ensure complete combustion of the waste gas stream.\n\n\n\nAuxiliary equipment includes three (3) steam boilers, three (3) redundant instrument air compressors, one backup electrical generator powered by a diesel engine, electrical and diesel driven fire water pumps, fire monitors throughout the plant and a 30,000 BBL fresh water storage tank for process usage and fire fighting.  \n\n\n\nAn open and closed drain system collects miscellaneous plant fluids into API separators.

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n    \n\n    The plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n    \n\n    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n    \n\n    The Willard CO2 Separation Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n    \n\n    Mechanical Integrity\n\n    \n\n    The Willard CO2 Separation Plant uses generally accepted industry recommended practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown (ESD) systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting on-site and off-site training (both company and vendor based) (2) contracting of third party companies for specific tasks, e.g. ultrasonic thickness (UT) testing, pressure safety vessel (PSV) testing, and API 510 vessel inspection, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n    \n\n    Maintenance and operating personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\n    \n\n    Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Willard CO2 Separation Plant incorporates quality assurance measures provided by plant engineering and the maintenance department, in the purchase and repair of equipment. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n    \n\n    Safe Work Practices\n\n    \n\n    The Willard CO2 Separation Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) visitors are given the plant safety orientation presentation and written exam annually, (3) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (4) a procedure for safe excavation and trenching, (5) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work permit), (6) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space and (7) MOC management of change procedures.  The Willard CO2 Plant Electrical Safety Plans, the Willard CO2 Plant Emergency Action Plan, and the Occidental Permian Drug and Alcohol Plan.  These procedures (and others), along with training of personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n    \n\n    Management of Change\n\n    \n\n    The Willard CO2 Separation Plant has a comprehensive system "

This MOC Management of Change Request system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before implementation. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. All pertinent chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n    \n\n    Incident Investigation\n\n    \n\n    The Willard CO2 Separation Plant promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each II Incident Investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the Production Coordinator for approval.  The Willard CO2 Separation Plant management is then responsible for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation. \n\n    \n\n    Compliance Audits\n\n    \n\n    To ensure that the incident prevention program is functioning properly, the Willard CO2 Sep"
