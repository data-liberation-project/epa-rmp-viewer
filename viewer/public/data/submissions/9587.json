The Insulation Systems Business Unit \n(ISB), of which the Fairburn Insulation Plant is a key part, demonstrates \nthis pursuit of excellence by proactively managing its operations to reduce \nenvironmental impacts while improving the quality of its products and \nthe well-being of its employees and the community.  ISB Environmental \nhas implemented a programmatic approach to compliance with the EPA's \nRisk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  All of the business units \nmanufacturing facilities will address process safety and risk management \nissues for key materials utilized by the plants in manufacturing fiberglass \ninsulation products. The program will fulfill the general duty clause \nrequirement in the RMP rule.  Facilities, like Fairburn, with threshold \nquantities above the RMP triggers, have utilized a management manual \nsystem to comply with the requirements of RMP.  This submittal only \ncharacterizes the subject processes that require a RMP submittal and \ncertification by June 21, 1999. \n\n2.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE \nPOLICIES\n\nOwens Corning is committed to developing and operating its \nmanufacturing facilities in a manner protective of the environment and \nhuman health.  This priority is expressed through continuing process \nimprovement, risk reduction, and an emphasis on pollution prevention.\nIn order to produce the quality products that Owens Corning is known \nfor, the Fairburn facility uses an aqueous ammonia solution to maintain \nthe pH of the chemical binder that is used at the facility.  The facility uses \npropane as motorized vehicle fuel for forklift trucks, as well as back-up \nfuel.  Because these are toxic chemicals, numerous controls have been \nimplemented to prevent an accidental release of these chemicals.  In the \nevent of a release, the Fairburn facility has an emergency response \nprogram "

This program is made up of employee \nvolunteers that have been properly trained in certain elements of \nemergency response, as well as communication with the appropriate \nresponder organizations in the community.\n\n3.0    DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED PROCESSES\n\nThe Fairburn facility, located in Fairburn, Georgia, is a producer of wool \nglass fibers, which are fabricated into insulation materials.  Glass fiber \nmanufacturing involves the high-temperature conversion of various \nmaterials into a homogeneous melt, followed by the fabrication of this \nmelt into glass fibers.  After the formation of the glass fibers, a \nthermosetting chemical binder solution is applied to the fibers.  The glass \nfibers and binder solution are then collected on a conveyor belt where \nthey are sent through a large curing oven and then through a cooling \nsection.  The result is a mat that is then cut into batts or rolls of the desired \ndimensions and then packaged.\n\nThe Fairburn Insulation plant has two covered processes that are subject \nto RMP.  Both the aqueous ammonia and liquid propane storage tank \nsystems are classified as Program 2 processes.  The ammonia process is a \nbinder system ingredient used to manufacture wool fiberglass insulation \nat the plant.  Propane is used as a backup fuel for the process and as a \nmotor vehicle fuel for plant forklifts and service equipment.\n\n4.0    HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nOwens Corning has determined the distance to the toxic endpoints for the \nregulated substances present at the Fairburn facility.  The following \nrelease scenarios have been considered:\n\n29.5% Ammonia    \n\n29.5% aqueous ammonia is received by bulk tanker \ntruck in approximately 4,700-gallon loads.  The bulk \nliquid is then off loaded from the truck into a 12,000-\ngallon fiberglass Ammonia storage tank in the Tank \nFarm.  The tank is located in a diked containment area \nwith a surface area of 546.2 square feet.  Tanker trucks \nunload the material throu"

The release duration is \nassumed to be 60-minutes because the concentration \nof aqueous ammonia in solution after 10-minutes of \nevaporation is not significantly lower than the initial \nconcentration.  \n\nDistance to Endpoint  -    0.45 miles  (ALOHA)\n\nThe alternative release involves a failure of the \nunloading line during product delivery resulting in a \nrelease of 3,800 pounds over a 5-minute period.  The \nliquid released from the line break is not immediately \ncontained.\n\nDistance to Endpoint  -    0.22 miles  (ALOHA)\n\nPropane    \n\nPropane is stored in six interconnected horizontal \nstorage tanks of 29,835-gallon water capacity.  The \nmaximum fill volume of each propane tank is 80% for \na capacity of 23,868 gallons.  At 4.24 lb/gal, each tank \nmaximum inventory is 101,200 pounds.  The tanks \noperate at ambient temperature and equilibrium \npressure.\n\nWorst-case release is an instantaneous release of \nmaximum inventory and formation of a vapor cloud, \nwhich explodes.  Ten percent of the vapor participates \nin the explosion.  Endpoint for a flammable is defined \nas the distance to a 1-psi overpressure.\n\nDistance to Endpoint  -    0.38 miles  (OCAG)\n\nAlternative case release is an instantaneous release of \nmaximum inventory and formation of a vapor cloud, \nwhich explodes.  Three percent of the vapor \nparticipates in the explosion.  Endpoint for a \nflammable is defined as the distance to a 1-psi \noverpressure.\n\nDistance to Endpoint -    0.23 miles (OCAG)\n\nThe release scenarios examined above could result in off-site impact.  Both \nOCA guidance look-up table values and air dispersion modeling results \nfor the toxic compounds via ALOHA were examined and reported as \nindicated.\n\n5.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/CHEMICAL-\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered in formulating the alternative \nscen"

However, it was not considered in evaluating the impact of the \nrelease scenarios.\n\nAccidental releases are mitigated by an aggressive spill reporting program \nand operator training in spill response.\n\n6.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo documented incidents have occurred for either covered process during \nthe preceding five-year period.\n\n7.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nFairburn maintains an up-to-date Emergency Response Plan and conducts \nmock drills to train personnel on response procedures.\n\n8.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn 1998, a spill containment area and system was installed for $137,000.  \nThe purpose of this area is to capture all non-storm water activity prior to \nreaching the plant's main storm water retention pond, which ultimately \ndischarges off plant property.  The containment area addresses all \ncontrolled drainage surfaces such as plant roadways, chemical and \nmaterial handling and storage areas, and the plant roof.  The containment \narea is equipped with sensors, which when activated, control a sluice gate \nat the inlet of the stormpond.  Upon evaluation, captured materials can be \nremoved to storage areas for appropriate disposition."
