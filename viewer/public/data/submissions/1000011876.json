Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nMann Packing Company conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nMann Packing Company uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Sheets R1.0 and R1.1 in Appendix A.2 show the facility location map and site plan, respectively.\n\nThe facility has both fixed and portable refrigeration systems onsite composed of screw and reciprocating compressors, evaporative condensers, evaporative cooling coils, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, and diffusion tanks. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by saf"

There are assigned responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\n\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage, water chilling, produce pre-cooling, and ice generation. A fixed system is attached to the main storage and processing building (Main System). This refrigeration system is used for cold storage, water chilling, ice generation, and hydro-cooling. There are refrigerated docks and holding rooms remote from the main facility that are supported by fixed and portable trailer mounted refrigeration units (Remote System). These portable units also support four (4) vacuum cooling tubes.\n\nThe Main System was started in 1980 and was designed per applicable building and safety codes current at the time of construction. A holding room was added to the dock in 1995 and a broccoli drier with refrigeration coils was added in 2001. In 2012, the facility added a cold room (Raw Product Warehouse) next to Cold Room 1. The Raw Product Warehouse has six (6) evaporative cooling coils, which are tied to main mechanical room.\n\nThe Remote System was started in 1994 and over the years, refrigeration has been supplied by various portable and fixed units, which vary in age but are well maintained and in good condition. In 2006, a cold room (Cold Room 2-Value Added) was added adjacent to Cold Rooms 4 and 5 containing six (6) new fan coils. Later, a high-pressure receiver and low-pressure recirculation package were installed and tied to the portable refrigeration trailers to support the vacuum tubes, Cold Rooms 4, 5, and 6, and Cold Room 2-Value Added. In 2011 and 2012, two (2) screw compressors, two (2) reciprocating compressors, and one (1) evaporative condenser were added to the trailer area as fixed equipment. In 2011, an additional cold room (Retail Warehouse) was completed containing five (5) new evaporative coo"

As of 2014, Cold Room 6 was being renovated and expanded with the addition of seven (7) evaporators to refrigerate the new space. The new equipment has been tied into the existing equipment of the remote system. Initial construction and all additions met the intent of the codes and standards current at the time of construction.\n\nThe Main and Remote Systems are not tied together and their refrigeration ammonia charges are approximately 23,407 lb and 15,165 lb, respectively. The portable trailers that serve the vacuum cooling tubes contain a separate charge of 9,008 lb. The total charge for all refrigeration systems is approximately 47,580 lb.\n\nUpdated refrigeration drawings are located in Appendix A.2-System Drawings. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in the schedules located on sheet R2.0. Refrigeration equipment locations of the Main, Remote, and vacuum tube systems can be found on the plans located on sheets R2.1 and R2.2. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix A.1, describe equipment details.\n\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are single-stage vapor compression cycles. In general, the process chemistries for these systems are shown in Section V.A.2.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4.i for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention "

      "SummaryText": "Program\n\n\n\nMann Packing Company maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. All relief valves at the facility are tied into ammonia diffusion tanks to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAccording to Mann Packing Company personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Appendix N.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Change"

      "SummaryText": "s to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Section VIII. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n"
