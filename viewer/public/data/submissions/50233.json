The business has operated from this location for more than 15 years as a responsible contributor to the community.\n\nThe company is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors dedicated to the code of management practice of the Responsible Distribution Process. The safe management of chemical products is considered priority to minimize the risk to our community, environment and personnel.\n\nAdditionally, Industrial Chemicals Inc. manages the facility in compliance with all Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) regulations.\n\nTo ensure the facility continues to operate in a safe and responsible manner in compliance with all regulations, an extensive risk management system has been developed and integrated into our operating procedures.\n\nSignificant components of the system include training, operating procedures for chemical handling, inspection, maintenance, emergency response and incident management. These procedures provided to responsible personnel and management's continual compliance oversight ensures safe chemical management.\n\nThe Facilities Director and Warehouse Manager are designated as having the primary responsibility and accountability to ensure the plan and all components are in compliance and implemented.\n\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is used for receipt, storage and distribution of chemical products.

These prepackaged containers include portable tanks, cylinders and drums.\n\nChlorine\n\nThis gas is contained within steel cylinders. The product is delivered to the facility on trailers specifically designed to transport the containers.\n\nThe chemical is liquefied under pressure and release from the container is in the form of a gas. The cylinders are equipped with safety mechanisms to minimize the possibility of an accidental release and pressure relief devices are installed should the container be exposed to excessive heat from elevated temperature conditions such as that associated with a fire.\n\nChlorine is shipped off site in small quantities to water treatment facilities using the gas to treat water for the public's use.\n\nThe containers are stored in secured racks to prevent accidental damage and stored in an area away from equipment traffic and chemicals that may, during an incident, contribute to a release from these containers.\n\nOnly authorized and trained personnel are permitted to handle the containers.\n\nSulfur Dioxide\n\nThis gas is contained within steel cylinders.

Classes are designed to achieve maximum results within the time period and knowledge is determined by verbal and written test. Management follows a yearly schedule issuing course work on a weekly basis to the facility manager. Classes are held at the facility on a weekly basis for one to two hours. Attendance is mandatory for all employees including drivers and warehouse personnel and the Operations Director verifies attendance.\n\nNew employees are required to receive an extensive orientation to the operating procedures for each phase of the operation including material handling equipment, transportation vehicle loading and unloading, transportation equipment operations, liquid material transfers, personal protection, hazard recognition and safe work practices.\n\nEmployees not having worked in a process receive an introduction by thorough procedural documentation review and pairing the employee with a person familiar with the process for an unspecified period. Management within the guidelines of the program verifies competency of safe operating practices.\n\nThe company provides training according to the following regulatory and association requirements:\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\n\nHazardous Waste Operations\nWorker Right-To-Know laws\nPowered Industrial Trucks\nMaterial Handling and Storage\nHazardous Materials\nToxic and Hazardous Substances\nPersonal Protection Equipment\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\nChemical Accident Prevention\nSolid Waste Management Guidelines\nStandards for Hazardous Waste Generators\nSuperfund, Emergency Planning and Community Right-To"

The vehicles are maintained according to a strict schedule by a company with a strong reputation in transportation equipment maintenance.\n\nAll portable tanks, know as tote tanks, are designed for and dedicated to specific products. Each container is inspected before filling using a systematic approach to verify that each and every component is in suitable condition.\n\nMaterial handling equipment such as fork lifts are inspected daily and each unit receives periodic maintenance according to a schedule. All equipment used in the handling of material are routinely inspected for defects and promptly removed from service when found defective.\n\nThe loading and unloading areas for transport vehicles are on concrete surfaces. A release occurring during the loading or unloading of packages can be contained to this area.\n\nMaterials stored within buildings are located in areas specific to their hazard class to prevent one group of hazard class from impacting another during an incident.\n\nAll buildings are constru"
