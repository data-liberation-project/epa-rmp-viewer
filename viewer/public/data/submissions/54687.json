Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nThis facility processes the covered chemical, which is listed in Section 302 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The same properties that make the covered chemical valuable for protection of health and living standard also make it necessary to observe safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to all stakeholders.  Vertex has implemented and maintains the elements of the Vertex Risk Management Program for all operating facilities.  Vertex senior management leadership implements through policy, participation, communications and resource commitments continuous improvement of performance to control risks of any sort to the community that could be controlled by Vertex.  It is Vertex policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Vertex is committed to a secure and safe environment, which depends upon the manner in which we handle the covered chemical, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nVertex emergency response program is based upon published industry standards, the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care\u00ae Management Systems, and applicable regulations.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of all required Federal, State and Local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2. Vertex facility and regulated substances handled. \nThe primary purpose of this facility is to provide sodium hypochlorite for bi-state area customers.  This site is remote from neighbors and protected with natural obstacles.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  Inventory is maintained at lowest amounts practical to insure continued supply to the water purification and commercial needs of customers."

Many redundant safety and security systems are in place, and every employee involved in Vertex bleach manufacture is trained to incident Command Level in case of an emergency.\n\n4. Five-year accident history.  \nVertex Chemical Corporation has three facilities which manufacture sodium hypochlorite using the covered chemical.  None of these facilities has experienced a reportable spill of this chemical nor any off-site consequences.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\nProcedures have been developed over the sixty-year history of Vertex in bleach manufacture to minimize the possibility of accidental chemical release.  Multiple safety and security measures have also been implemented/installed.  Vertex emergency response is coordinated with Dupo and East Carondelet Fire and Police Departments as well as the St. Clair County Emergency Management.  Vertex personnel receive annual training; participate in regular safety and security meetings and multiple drills and exercises annually.  This facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon Industry Standard Guidance.  We have hosted meetings at our facility annually, to which the Local Emergency Planning Committee Chairman, Police and Fire Departments have been invited/attended for Hazmat education/tour.  Vertex programs have been discussed.  Representatives of the Dupo and East Carondelet Fire Department and the St. Clair County Emergency Services visited the facility November 12, 2008.\n\n6.
