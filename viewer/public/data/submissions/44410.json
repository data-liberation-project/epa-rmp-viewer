This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \nDescription - Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n \nThe ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery, located at 401 South 23rd Street, Billings, Montana is owned and operated by ConocoPhillips Company. The refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (for example, propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, and coke) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. In addition, the refinery processes hydrocarbons using Hydrofluoric Acid (HF), a regulated substance.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nAll scenarios were reviewed by ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery personnel and verfied as being appplicable to current operating parameters.\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nThe ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. The frequency of all-accidental releases and injuries to our employees has decreased during this period. We investigate every incident thoroughly to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring and keep records of all incidents that occur at our facility. No incidents have occurred that have resulted in off-site impact during this time. In addition, there have been no on-site incidents involving a covered process that resulted in an RMP reportable accident since our last RMP submission.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program"

All processes at the refinery regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard. This summary addresses each of the applicable OSHA PSM/RMP elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. These procedures are considered to be our PSM/RMP Compliance Plan.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management, which also includes participation in the RMP accident prevention program. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, writing operating and maintenance procedures, and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery PSM/RMP programs.\n\nSpecific ways that employees are involved in the refinery programs are documented in our employee participation plan. It addresses each accidental release prevention program element. In addition, the refinery regularly undertakes initiatives that address continuous improvement of our process safety management/risk management system and employee safety. These initiatives include having active teams that promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.

Specific positions and groups within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Management responsibilities are outlined in our PSM administrative procedure, Process Safety Information, PSM-ADM-03 that describes our Process Technology Package (PTP) information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, are provided through material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safe operating limits (SOL s) for specific process parameters (for example, temperature, level, and composition) in our PTPs. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument safety systems (for example, automated shutdown systems). Information covering these issues can be found in our refinery PTPs and is available for all employees to access.\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and other data. This information, in conjunction with written mechanical department activity procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for established inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process changes.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The refinery recognized techniques to perform these evaluations. All our PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and makes recommendations for additional prevention and safety measures or design changes when the team believes such actions are necessary.\n\nLocal management reviews the PHA Team recommendations, and employees are assigned accountability to resolve all recommendation that have been made by the PHA team and accepted by local management. The PHA Team prioritizes implementation of recommendations in response to PHA findings. All approved recommendations being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. Upon completion of all recommendations for a specific PHA, a final report is issued that all affected employees can access. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency for the life of the process. Again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. Additional details, including management respon"

Emergency shutdown procedures include the conditions requiring shutdown and assign responsibility for determining when to initiate an emergency shutdown to appropriate personnel.\n\nThese procedures are used by all operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators. All procedures are periodically reviewed with a mandatory minimum review period of 36 months. The refinery Manager annually certifies that all operating procedures are current and accurate. We use our management of change procedure to track changes to procedures when the MOC identifies a need for procedural changes as a result of the change.  Procedures are readily available to operators in the process and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. Additional information, including management responsibilities, can be found in our PSM administrative procedure that outlines this element, PSM Procedures Program, (PSM-ADM-05).\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.
