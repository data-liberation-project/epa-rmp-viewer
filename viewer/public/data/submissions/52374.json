The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quanties; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to access possible effects on employees and offsite public and enviromental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, an emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probility and magnitude of accidential releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule of responsibilities for implimentation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed with the USEPA and The Sacramento County Enviromential Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division as required by fedral and state ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental release of RS's. \n                                                                                                                                   \nStationary Source and Regulated SubstancesHandled\nThe City of Galt's Wastewater Treeatment Plant is located at 10059 Twin Cities Road, Galt CA in Sacramento County.

The Chlorine is used for odor control of the influent wastewater, to disinfect the wastewater effluent, and for other process usses.  The Sulfur Dioxide is used to dechlorinate the disinfected effluent for aquatic toxicity control between November 1st and April 30th.  Pressurized Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide gas within ton containers is withdrawn under pressure and piped to a Vacuum regulator valve located in the storage room where the gas pressure is reduced to vacuum.  From there, the chlorine or sulfur dioxide under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotometers in chlorinators or sulfonators located in a seprate room, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector. \n                                                            \nGeneral Accidental  release Prevention Programs\nGeneral accidential release prevention programs instituted by the City of Galt are categorized as administrative )management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.
