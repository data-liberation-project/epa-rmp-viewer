Weyerhaeuser Company transferred ownership of the Port Wentworth Mill from Willamette Industries, Inc. on June 30, 2002.  The Port Wentworth Mill is a fully integrated bleached pulp mill that commenced operations under Willamette  in September, 2000.  Willamette obtained ownership of the facility in May, 2000.  Previously, Stone Container Corporation owned and operated the mill.  In 1991, Stone installed a new bleached pulp line which included a Eka SVP chlorine dioxide plant.  Chlorine dioxide is a key bleaching element.  Prior to the effective date of RMP program development (6-21-99), Stone Container Corporation shut down the Port Wentworth facility due to market conditions.  This shutdown occurred in October of 1998.  Chlorine dioxide is the only item which is applicable to the RMP program.\r\n\r\nThe facility is located near Port Wentworth, Ga (Chatham County) or about 5 miles upstream from Savannah, Ga on the Savannah River.  The topography surrounding the mill is comprised of coastal plains and wetlands.  The City of Port Wentworth surrounds the facility and has a population of about 6,300.  However, within a 30 mile radius of the facility lies a metropolitan area including the City of Savannah and Hunter Army Airfield.  Additionally, the surrounding area contains many and varied industries.\r\n\r\nThe only product manufactured at the Port Wentworth facility is bleached wood pulp. \r\n\r\n2.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Port Wentworth Mill  is committed to the safety of its employees and the general public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

In addition, after the work order is completed, the results of the work, particularly for PM inspections, can be stored in the SAP system.  This allows for a good mechanical history for all equipment to be archived.  In addition, the SAP system is able to rate the priority of work requests by the priority rating which has been assigned to each process.  By using this system, the PSM/RMP covered process receives the highest rating allowing prompt response to mechanical and maintenance issues as they arise.  The SAP system is able to generate inspection work orders for the covered process based on frequency originally inputted into SAP.  This allows for vendor recommended routine inspections to take place on the prescribed frequency.\r\n\r\n5.6 Management of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nThe Port Wentworth Mill utilizes an electronic MOC system for the ClO2 covered process such that any proposed change or modification to a covered process must first be reviewed for process safety considerations.  A team comprised of operating, engineering, maintenance, and process control personnel meet periodically to review current and upcoming MOC Requests.  Changes to the process can only occur after the MOC is approved by all required MOC reviewers.  All MOC requests are maintained in the electronic MOC System and documented/filed in the PSM/RMP file system.  In addition, any PSI or engineering documentation change required because of an approved MOC are noted within the MOC System as an action item and follow is required on the mill's electronic task tracker system.\r\n\r\n5.7 Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\n\r\nPSSRs are conducted for any startup of projects that occur within the boundary of the covered process or after a major maintenance outage.  PSSR is conducted by operating, maintenance, engineering, and process controls personnel to ensure that all systems are verifie"

The PHA served to provide a list of recommended changes and fixes to the plant during the pre-startup safety review prior to start up.  The Hazard and Operability (HazOp) technique was used to complete the PHA.  Per the requirements of the RMP program, the PHA has been repeated or reviewed every five years.\r\n\r\n5.3 Standard Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe mill has developed and implemented Standard Operating Procedures in every operating area, including the ClO2 covered process.  SOPs include normal operating, emergency operating, temporary operating, as well as start up and shutdown procedures.  SOPs were developed using vendor supplied and recommended practices modified and applied to specific processes.  Where additional procedures are deemed necessary, qualified personnel from that operating area develop applicable operating procedures.  The SOP program is a dynamic program in that SOPs are continually reviewed and updated.\r\n\r\n5.4 Training\r\n\r\nPort Wentworth employees involved with the operation and maintenance of the covered ClO2 process are trained periodically to ensure that their knowledge of the process and procedures is complete.  This training includes training supplied by the vendor of the ClO2 technology, in this case Eka Nobel.  Additionally, training and qualification is an essential element of a technicians advancement in Port Wentworth's pay and progression system.  All employees within the Fiberline area are trained annually on the covered process and the requirements of RMP.\r\n\r\n5.5 Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Port Wentworth Mill uses a computer based maintenance system, called SAP, to manage maintenance and mechanical integrity activi"

In the event of an accidental release, the Port Wentworth Mill controls and contains, to the extent possible, the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public or damage to the environment.  In addition, the Port Wentworth Mill will investigate incidents soon after they occur to determine the root cause(s) for the incident and develop plans to ensure that the incident does not occur again.\r\n\r\n3.0  RMP Applicability\r\n\r\nThe Port Wentworth facility employs one process that contains chemicals to such a degree that the process is required to be covered under the RMP program, 40 cfr 68.  The one covered process is a Eka SVP chlorine dioxide plant.  The chlorine dioxide plant contains three storage tanks that contain 18,930 lb. of chlorine dioxide.  The threshold quantity for chlorine dioxide is 1,000 lb.  In this case, the boundary of the covered process has been developed conservatively so that the chlorine dioxide generation process is covered as well as just the storage tanks.\r\n\r\n4.0  Overview of the Eka Chlorine Process and Off-site Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\n4.1  Eka SVP Process\r\n\r\nThe Eka process produces chlorine dioxide in a closed recirculating reactor.  In this case, sodium chlorate and sulfuric acid are added together in a closed dynamic reactor to produce chlorine dioxide gas.  Methanol is also added to the reactor to serve as a catalyst.  Chlorine dioxide gas is drawn off the top of the reactor and routed to a chilled water absorption column where the chilled water strips the chlorine dioxide out of the gas stream to form liquid chlorine dioxide, which is 11.5 g/L ClO2 concentration.  Chlorine dioxide is stored in three storage tanks with a combined capacity of 18,930 lb.  \r\n\r\n4.2.1  Worst Case Scenario Review\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario would be the complete failure of all three chlorine dioxide storage tanks"

This gas cloud would impact an area of up to 5.53 miles from the plant site.  Within this boundary and depending upon wind direction, a gas cloud could impact the City of Port Wentworth, the Savannah International Airport, the City of Garden City, and the north end of the City of Savannah. \r\n\r\n4.2.2  Alternate Release Scenario Review\r\n\r\nThe most probable alternate release scenario is the rupture of a 6 pipe, 280 feet long containing chlorine dioxide.  In this case, the total contents of the pipe would be released.  As with the worst case scenario, the liquid chlorine dioxide would pool on the ground then vaporize forming a gas cloud.  A total of 58.8 lb. of chlorine dioxide would be released.  This gas cloud would impact an area up to 1.62 miles from the mill site.  Only the City of Port Wentworth would be affected by this type of release.\r\n\r\n5.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Port Wentworth Mill takes a proactive view of preventing incidents related to releases of hazardous chemicals.  We value OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP program on the same level and in many cases combine into one effort those overlapping prevention activities.
