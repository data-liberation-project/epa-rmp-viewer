This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES     \n\nThe Conway LPG Storage Facility is located on Kansas State Highway No. 56, approximately 6.5 miles west of McPherson, Kansas.  The Conway LPG Storage Facility provides storage and terminal operations for liquefied petroleum gas and unleaded gasoline.  Stored products are shipped from the facility via pipeline systems, trucks and railcars.  The Conway LPG Storage Facility is able to store enough propane, butane and other flammable materials to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for the Conway LPG Storage Facility is a vapor cloud explosion involving the worst possible release of a flammable mixture (predominately consisting of Normal Butane), from a LPG underground storage well having the largest casing diameter, greatest inventory, and highest pressure.  The release is assumed to last for 10 minutes after a shearing of the 13-3/8 inch outside diameter well casing from well #37.  The release forms a vapor cloud that ignites and explodes - creating a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the 1-psig overpressure endpoint is 0.8 miles.  Although there are "

      "SummaryText": "numerous controls to prevent such releases, and to manage their consequences, no credit for these measures was taken into account in evaluating this unlikely WCS. \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) that is used as a planning case at the Conway LPG Storage Facility is a release of propane due to an overfill of propane into a storage well that backs up through a 10-3/4 inch outside diameter brine line at brine pond #3.  The pumping rate of the pressurized propane liquid to the atmosphere is calculated at a rate of 514 pounds per minute.  This particular ARS is assumed to last for 10 minutes before operation of isolation valves, pumps, shutdowns and/or other mitigating actions can be utilized to mitigate the release.  Under this ARS, the released propane vaporizes and is accidentally ignited - causing a vapor cloud fire.  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the lower flammability limit endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 mile.  With a radius of 0.1 miles, this ARS would extend outside of the boundary of the Conway LPG Storage Facility.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \n  The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Facility.  The processes at the Conway LPG Storage Facility is regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Because RMP accident prevention requirements for these processes are essentially the same as PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements, and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the Conway LPG Storage Facility.  \n \n Employee Participation\n \n The Conway LPG Storage Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, "

These PHAs are revalidated at least every 5 years, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process no longer contains hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantities.  The recommendations from these revalidated PHAs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\n \n Operating Procedures\n \n The Conway LPG Storage Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. In addition, the Conway LPG Storage Facility maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n Training\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Conway LPG Storage Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating the process.

The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  When new facilities are commissioned, a PHA is included in the PSSR.  \n \n Mechanical Integrity\n \n The Conway LPG Storage Facility has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
