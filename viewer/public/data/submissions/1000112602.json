Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices\n\nAs stated in our Health, Safety, and Environmental Policy and Principles, the facility is committed to health, safety, and environmental excellence.  To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health safety, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Corporate Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases. \n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual is Emergency Response Polices that states that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant's Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials. \n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis plant produces phenol-formaldehyde resins, urea-formaldehyde, and wax emulsions.\n\nThe regulated substances used in quantities above the minimum thresholds are: Formaldehyde solution (52%)\n\n3. Accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations.  A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance.  This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and monthly Health, Safety, & Environmental Steering Committee meetings, where a management control checksheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule.

Their duties include keeping operation procedures up-to-date; training operating technicians so they can safely follow theses procedures; assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis; and, when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit. All employees participate in the safety program to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nDesignated personnel maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, equipment information, process safety information, mechanical integrity information, and a training certification program. Operating technicians use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference. By applying the information it contains their actions prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release. As a result of initial process hazard review, a significant investment was made in process control systems. Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action items database to track the items to completion.  PHA completion dates are based on Site Leader signature of final report.\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processed do not cause accidents. For equipment, procedure, and process changes, a MOC initiates a safety review. This review may include a process hazard analysis. Changes to product formulations initiate a review by technical and plant personnel.\n\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment. A computer database is used to manage the preventive maintenance schedule and other corrective or improvement repairs necessary to maintain the ongoing integrity and reliability of the facility equipment.

      "SummaryText": "scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed. The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases. One important section describes safety measures for welding or other \"hot\" work, which includes a Hot Work Permit system to reduce the risk of fire. The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out and tagging out equipment for maintenance. These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices. Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\n\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and their root cause determined.  Actions are taken to prevent recurrence. These actions may include improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.\n\nInternal Corporate Health, Safety and Environmental Audits are conducted periodically to maintain compliance with local, state and federal regulations. Regional Safety and Environmental professionals periodically review the health, safety, and environmental programs. Addressing recommendations from these audits and reviews keeps the Facility's Safety and Environmental programs effective.\n\n4. Five-year accident history\n\nIn the five year period from June 18, 2019 to June 14, 2024 there were no reportable releases of regulated substances meeting the RMP requirements.  \n\n5.
