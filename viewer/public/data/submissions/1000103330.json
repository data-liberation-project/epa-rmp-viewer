Such events include but are not limited to: fires and explosions, uncontrollable spills and emissions, medical emergencies, workplace violence, and natural disasters. \nThis site does not have a formal Emergency Response Team and therefore will evacuate employees in the event of a hazardous materials emergency. However, operations and maintenance employees are trained and knowledgeable of the hazards of the chemicals they work with daily, and therefore are expected to respond to incidental spills in the areas in which they work.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and incident investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."

The facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe Los Angeles Plant operates four major reactors that manufacture mainly epoxy curing agents. Epoxy curing agents are used to manufacture paints, adhesives, composite materials and civil engineering floors. The plant's process uses various types of amines and modifies its properties using solvents, resins and other chemicals to make it easier to handle for consumers. Ethylenediamine (CAS# 107-15-3) and a 37% solution of formaldehyde (CAS # 50-0-0) in water are the two raw materials used on site that are on the Regulated substance list and have exceeded the threshold quantity for Federal EPA and CalARP requirements.  In addition, Phenol (CAS# 108-95-2) is also regulated under CalARP. \n\nEthylenediamine is used in the manufacture of amine adducts. Ethylenediamine is received in 55 gallon drums. Ethylenediamine is transferred to the reactor and processed. The resulting finished product can contain small amounts of ethylenediamine. The excess unreacted ethylenediamine is collected and stored in tote bins. The collected eth"
