The purpose of this RMP/PSM Manual is to assist with the prevention of accidental releases of toxic and flammable substances that can cause harm to the public, facility employees, and to the environment.\n\n1.1\tOperations\nNelson Brothers, LLC is located at 500 Old Baltimore Road in Parrish, Alabama. The site consists of 12 reactors and 60+ bulk storage tanks of raw materials and finished products.  The facility operates on a 24-hour, 7 day per week schedule. The anhydrous ammonia storage facility at the plant consists of a 10,000-gallon storage tank located on a concrete pad adjacent to the R-800 tank farm. Vapor and liquid connections are provided for receiving bulk ammonia deliveries by tank truck.  The deliveries are made by Tanner Industries.\n\n1.2\tApplicability\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored on site as a pressurized liquid in a 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tank (TK80543). The presence of approximately 52,000 pounds (i.e., greater than 10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia requires compliance with EPA\u0092s RMP rules (Risk Management Program, 40 CFR 68) and OSHA\u0092s PSM rules (Process Safety Management, 29 CFR 1910.119). The facility is subject to RMP Program 3 requirements as specified in 40 CFR 68.10 based on the determination that the toxic endpoint for a worst-case release of anhydrous ammonia is within the vicinity of public receptors. The facility submitted the initial Risk Management Plan to the EPA on January 31, 2020. Nelson Brothers will fully update and re-submit the RMP at least once every five years.  \n\n2.0\tPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nNelson Brothers, LLC maintains current safety information regarding the storage, use and off-loading of anh"

Safety information is presented in the following sections.\n\n2.1\tHazards of Regulated Substance\nThe following information has been compiled to identify the hazards of anhydrous ammonia:\n\u0095\tSDS (Anhydrous Ammonia)\n\u0095\tA Basic Understanding of Anhydrous Ammonia - developed by Airgas Inc.\n\n2.2\tMaximum Intended Inventory\nThe maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 43,775 lbs. based on the following:\n\u0095\tTank TK80543 is a 10,000-gallon storage tank.\n\u0095\tThe maximum fill setting is 85% (per SOP: DM-200-1). The contents of TK80543 are limited by administrative controls to 8,500 gallons of liquid.\n\u0095\tAt 5.15 lb./gal for anhydrous ammonia at 60 \u00b0F and 92.9 psi, the maximum liquid content of TK80543 is 43,775 pounds.\n\n2.3\tSafe Upper and Lower Limits\nThe following information was provided to Nelson Brothers, LLC for the safe upper and lower limits for the system: \n\u0095\tTank TK80543: 265 psig @ 150 ?F; 10,000-gallon gross\n\u0095\tThe system contains a vaporizer, air mixer, air heater, and other components typically associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n2.4\tConsequences of Deviation \nThe consequences of deviation could potentially result in releases to the environment or exposure of anhydrous ammonia to employees or to the public.\nWhen anhydrous ammonia is cooled or compressed, it is in the liquid form. Storing it under pressure prevents it from vaporizing and makes it available for use in large volumes. One cubic foot of anhydrous ammonia in a liquid state produces 855 cubic feet of ammonia gas\nWhen anhydrous ammonia is released from compression in a storage tank (200 psi) to the atmosphere (0 psi), the temperature drops from 100 ?F to minus 28 ?F. At this temperature, ammonia will freeze/burn human skin on contact and clothing can be frozen to the skin. Since anhydrous ammonia is stored under high pressure, a sudden rupture can shoot ammonia 10 to 20 feet from the point of release.\n\n2.5\tMaterials of Construction\nTh"

When these components and fittings come in contact with ammonia liquid or vapor, the metal will corrode and will fail. \n\n2.6\tRelief System Design & Design Basis \nRelief valves, located on the top of the ammonia storage tanks, were designed in accordance with the following guidelines:\n\u0095\tAmerican National Standard Institute (ANSI) K61.1 - Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\n\u0095\tOSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n2.7\tVentilation System Design \nA ventilation system has not been designed for the Ammonia system since none of the process is located in an enclosed area.\n\n2.8\tDesign Codes and Standards Employed\nThe following design codes and standards were employed in the construction of the Ammonia system:\n\u0095\tAmerican National Standard Institute (ANSI) K61.1 - Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia (1999 Edition)\n\u0095\tOSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n2.9\tSafety Systems\nGuidelines from the 1999 edition of ANSI K61.1, Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia were reviewed regarding the use of water on ammonia spills.

The checklist identifies the following information:\n\n\u0095\tdate of the inspection or test\n\u0095\tthe name of the person who performed the inspection or test\n\u0095\tthe serial number or other identifier of the equipment on which the inspection or test was performed\n\u0095\ta description of the inspection or test performed\n\u0095\tthe results of the inspection or test\n\nWhen deficiencies are identified during inspections, Nelson Brothers, LLC will correct the problem and return the ASA system to acceptable parameter limits specified in the process safety information. Corrections will occur A) before further use, or B) in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to ensure safe operation.\n\n8.0\tMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nNelson Brothers, LLC has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to the ASA system equipment and associated procedures. These procedures ensure that the following considerations are addressed prior to any change:\n\n\u0095\tThe technical basis for the proposed change\n\u0095\tImpact of change on safety and health\n\u0095"

According to OSHA, \u0093Emergency Response\u0094 is defined as \u0093a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area\u0085.to an occurrence which could result, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release\u0094 of ammonia. Excluded from this definition is the quick response to an incidental release of ammonia where it can be controlled at the time of the release by an employee in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel, where there is no potential safety or health hazard.  Due to the nature of anhydrous ammonia, only the most minor incidents would be included in this exception due to the immediacy of the dispersion of the ammonia plume and the threat to people on and off site.\n\n13.2 \tEmergency Action Plan (EAP)\nNelson Brothers, LLC has prepared an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with the OSHA regulations found at 29 CFR 1910.38(a).

Nelson Brothers will provide the Walker County LEPC and the Parrish Fire Department with the most recent EAP, emergency contact information, and any other information necessary for developing and implementing an effective community emergency response plan. The purpose of the annual coordination is to allow the facility to update and discuss the information being provided and to allow the local authorities to provide any updated information on the community emergency response plan. The coordination will be documented and include contact information (name, phone number, email address), dates and description of the coordination activities."
