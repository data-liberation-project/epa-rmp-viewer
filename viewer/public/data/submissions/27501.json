Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Colby Fertilizer, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Thomas County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.    Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage fertilizers of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application AS A NUTRIENT for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 370,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the LARGEST storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .84 miles.\nb.    The alternate release scenario, a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles. (The most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.

Accidental Release\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is referenced in the RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3(b).\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n6.    Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.    A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb.    Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\nc.    If large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n1.    Within 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify: The National Emergency Response Center @ 800/424-8802.\n2.    With-in 24 hours of determining the amount of release would effect the environment, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:  Kansas Bureau of Environmental Remediation @ 785/296-1679 or after normal business hours  785/296-0614 and The Kansas Department of Emergency Management @ 785/296-3176.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions OF THE FACILITY.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use"
