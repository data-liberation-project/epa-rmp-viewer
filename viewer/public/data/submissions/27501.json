If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Thomas County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.\tFacility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage fertilizers of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application AS A NUTRIENT for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 370,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the LARGEST storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .84 miles.\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario, a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles. (The most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.
