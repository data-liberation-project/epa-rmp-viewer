      "SummaryText": "Hunter Panels located at 9 Hudson Crossing Drive in Montgomery, NY manufacturers rigid polyisocyanurate foam insulating panels for use in commercial and industrial roofing applications.  The company employs approximately 75 people at the facility.  Hunter Panels occupies an approximate 371,000 square foot facility in Orange County, New York.  Facility boundaries include Neelytown Road to the North, railroad tracks to the East, Eager Road to the South, and a plot of land for future development to the West.\n\n\n\nThe polyisocyanurate foam insulating panels are produced by reacting a polyol (POLY) in a blend including a flame retardant and catalyst with polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (ISO).  There are two manufacturing lines for manufacturing these panels at the facility.  Pentane material is used as an expanding or blowing agent in the production of the panels.  Different varieties of pentane material can be used including various blends of n-pentane, isopentane, and cyclopentane.  Isopentane and n-pentane are regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule with a 10,000 pound threshold.  Cyclopentane is not regulated under the RMP Rule.  Hunter Panels is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard in 29 CFR 1910.119 for all three isomers of pentane and maintains one plan to meet both the RMP and PSM requirements.\n\n\n\nThe facility receives a liquid pentane blend via tank truck and stores it two aboveground pressure vessels.  Pentane Storage Tank 1, which serves manufacturing Line 1, has a capacity of 25,000 gallons.  Pentane Storage Tank 2, which serves manufacturing Line 2, has a capacity of 25,300 gallons.  This volume equates to a pentane storage capacity of approximately 130,000 to 157,000 pounds per tank (approximately 260,000 to 314,000 pounds total) depending upon which pentane blend is used.  Throughout the RMP and Process Safety Management (PSM) documentation at the facility the combination of various isomers of pentane is sim"

      "SummaryText": "ply referred to as pentane.  No distinction is made to exclude a possible cyclopentane portion of the blend from the RMP component of the regulations.  For purposes of the Risk Management Plan submittal, a maximum of 262,000 pounds of n-pentane and 260,500 pounds of isopentane are addressed.  Please note that 262,000 pounds is the maximum amount of the combination of the two isomers of pentane that could be present at the site at any one time.  For example, if the current blend is essentially n-pentane and 262,000 pounds of n-pentane are on-site, virtually no isopentane would be on site at the same time. \n\n\n\nThe process with respect to PSM and RMP regulations starts with the unloading of pentane into the storage tank and continues through the point where cured panels are cut to .  Process steps include transfer of pentane to a metering skid, mixing of pentane with polyol blend, and reaction of the POLY with ISO, using pentane as the expanding agent, to form foam on top of a substrate.  The chemical mixture and substrate are drawn into the laminator oven, where the mixture adheres to the substrate and a top-sheet as the solid foam is formed.   At the crosscut saw station, the sheet is cut into long panels and the edges are trimmed to a precise 4-foot width.  The long panels then move to a gang saw station where additional crosscutting reduces the panels to the desired lengths, typically 4 or 8 feet.  At this point of the process, production of the foam panels using the pentane blowing agent is complete representing the end of the process that is covered under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nHunter Panels maintains a detailed emergency action plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The Plant Manager serves as facility coordinator for implementation of the emergency action plan. Employees are trained to respond to incidental releases at the facility.  Hunter Panels maintains a contract with an off-site emergency responder for large scale environmental emergencies.  Th"
