Pool Chlor of Nevada has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1973.\n\nPool Chlor of Nevada's manager/owner is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The owner administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1973.  The process is located at 5560 Procyon Street, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89118.  The chlorine transfer process for Pool Chlor of Nevada consists of chlorine one-ton containers (maximum of 8) which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from a one-ton container through a filling manifold to 20-pound cylinders.  The system also includes a scrubber water tank.  The maximum quantity of chlorine on-site is 16,000 pounds.  The filling station is located outside under a canopy.  Misters are used to cool the chlorine containers during high temperatures.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPool Chlor of Nevada has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used to neutr"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPool Chlor of Nevada is a designated non-responding facility.  If a release of chlorine were to occur, Pool Chlor of Nevada's action plan is to call 911 in order to reach the local emergency responders.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPool Chlor of Nevada has revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (February 2009)which generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Pool Chlor facility.  The scheduled completion date of all changes resulting from the PHA Revalidation is February 2010.  In the meantime, Pool Chlor of Nevada's safety committee has completed several items, including some recommendations, in a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility's Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and im"
