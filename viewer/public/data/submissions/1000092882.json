DU has in place mandatory annual chlorine emergency response training for all employees who work at the WTP. Additionally, specific training is required in all aspects of the operation of the Pre-Chlorination and Post-Chlorination procesess for those who operate the processes. Training in maintenance and repair of the Pre-Chlorination and Post-Chlorination process equipment is conducted with all employees who are required to maintain and repair any part of the system. Decatur Utilities has developed a chlorine Emergency Response Program to fulfill the requirements of OSHA Part 1910.38. The Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the local and state emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nSection B:  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Decatur Water Treatment Plant has one stationary source capable of holding twenty-four (24) 1-ton containers of chlorine as well as one stationary source capable of holding twelve (12) 1-ton containers of chlorine. The covered processes consist of piping (per the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 6, Piping Systems for Dry Chlorine) and chlorine injection equipment specifically designed for each process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection D:  Prevention Program Elements\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\n\n\nDecatur Utilities has documented a management system and has assigned overall responsibility for development and implementation of the Risk Management Plan to the Risk Management Plan Manager. The management system clearly delineates accountability and responsibility of specific elements of the program to the appropriate Risk Management Plan Team Member.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nCurrent process safety information is available to all operators of the covered processes and maintenance employees in a"

Safety information includes current SDS sheets, maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flows, process equipment and material specifications, safe operating procedures and codes and standards used in the design and construction of the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\n    \n\nA Hazard Analysis has been performed for the Program II covered processes. A Hazard Review checklist was developed to address potential hazards associated with the Program II covered processes and regulated substance.  Causes of potential accidental release scenarios were investigated and safeguards put in place to prevent a release.  The process hazard analysis was documented and is updated every five-years.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures  \n\n\n\nProcess operating procedures were reviewed, documented, and refresher training conducted with all plant operators and maintenance employees.  Operating procedures cover all phases of process operations including system startup, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup following an emergency shutdown. Process limits were reviewed and documented. \n\n\n\nTraining \n\n\n\nChlorine safety training is performed at least once every 3 years. This includes training on the WTP Risk Management Program, upper and lower process limits for the regulated substance and consequences of deviation from the limits, hazards associated with the regulated substance, processes, and procedures, chlorine leak response, operating procedures for the covered processes and a third party chlorine safety course. Mandatory annual training is conducted on the WTP Emergency Response Plan, process PPE, and first aid measures for chlorine exposures. Pre-Chlorination and Post-Chlorination process maintenance and repair training is conducted for all employees involved in maintaining the on-going mechanical integrity of the processes. This training includes the hazards of the processes, how to avoid or corre"

This training shall be completed prior to the employee performing maintenance tasks on equipment involved in the covered processes.  Documentation of employee attendance at all training sessions is maintained for a period of not less than 5 years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity  \n\n \n\nAll process equipment, piping, ventilation system, monorail and hoist, have a documented schedule of inspection, and preventive and periodic maintenance.  All maintenance inspection and testing on chlorine process equipment is conducted as per manufacturer's recommendations and is consistent with accepted engineering practices. Any deficiencies identified during such maintenance and inspections are addressed in a safe and prompt manner. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every 3 years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process. A report of the audit findings is generated following the audit and all deficiencies or recommendations are promptly addressed and the resolution is documented.  The two most recent audits are maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nSpecific incident investigation reporting and documentation procedures have been implemented and are followed in response to any incident involving a covered process that did or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine. The incident investigation is conducted as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours following the incident. Following the investigation a summary report is generated and includes, at a minimum, the following information: date of incident, date the investigation began, description of the incident and any contributing factors, and any corrective action or recommendations resulting from the investigation.      \n\n\n\nSection E:  Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nAn accidental release is defined in part 68.42 Section A as having resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property"
