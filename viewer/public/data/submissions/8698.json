      "SummaryText": "A.     Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGenpak LLC (Genpak) produces foamed polystyrene food trays and containers using a single screw and tandem system of extruding expanded polystyrene foam sheets.  The process takes polystyrene pellets through an extrusion process where a nuclient and blowing agent (isopentane) are added.  The sheets are then thermoformed and cut to produce the final product. \n\nIsopentane is delivered to the Genpak - Middletown, New York facility via railcar.  The railcar is unloaded into an underground storage tank using a transfer pump.  A vapor recovery system prevents the release of isopentane vapors to the atmosphere during the transfer.  Isopentane is pumped from the storage tank to the isopentane pump room where the pressure is increased so it can be injected into one of the 4 extruders.\n\nAs a result of the manufacturing process, isopentane is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified by EPA regulations.  Genpak - Middletown has one covered process that requires compliance with Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\n\nB.     Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Genpak\n\nGenpak - Middletown is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Plant Emergency Evacuation Plan.\n\nSafety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC.     Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations Genpak performed the following offsite consequence analyses.\n\n- One worst-case release scenario for isopentane.\n- One alternate release scenario for isopentane.\n\nThe following are brief descriptions of the release scenar"

Genpak elected to use the look-up tables contained in the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document calculate estimated release rates and to determine the distances to the appropriate flammable endpoints. \n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Federal Register dated May 26, 1999 (Volume 64, Number 101) page 28697 states that the following changes to ' 68.25 have been made by EPA: \"For regulated flammable substances that are normally liquids at ambient temperatures, the owner or operator shall assume that the entire quantity in the vessel or pipe, as determined under ' 68.25(b), is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  The owner or operator shall assume that the quantity which becomes vapor in the first 10 minutes is reported as the quantity released.\"  Genpak elected to use the look-up tables contained in the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document (April 1999) to calculate estimated release rates and to determine the distances to the appropriate flammable endpoints.\n\nThe Middletown, NY facility utilizes a 30,000 gallon underground isopentane storage tank.  However, this vessel was not considered for the worst-case release scenario.  From page 4-11 of EPA's General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998) \"Reservoirs or vessels sufficiently buried underground are passively mitigated or prevented from failing catastrophically.\"  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for the Genpak LLC - Middletown facility was calculated assuming that the entire contents of a railcar containing 25,600 gallons (132,400 pounds) of isopentane forms a liquid pool, one centimeter deep beneath the railcar.  The 132,400 pounds of isopentane is assumed to vaporize within the first then minutes of the release and form a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits which then detonates.  Ten percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate i"

Using Equation C-1 from the guidance document, the distance to an overpressure level of 1 psi from the explosion of the vapor cloud was calculated to be 0.41 miles (2,165 feet).  There are three public receptors (Orange & Rockland Utilities, Middletown Sewage Treatment Plant and the Moon School) and no environmental receptors located within the 0.41 mile radius.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Genpak LLC - Middletown facility was calculated assuming a =-inch hole in the 3-inch unloading hose from the railcar.  This scenario resulted in the formation of a liquid pool containing approximately 48 pounds of isopentane which evaporated, found an ignition source and produced a vapor cloud fire.  The release rate and evaporation rate from the pool of isopentane were calculated using the guidance document assuming that no mitigation was present.  The distance to the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) for this scenario represents the maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire might have serious consequences.   The distance to the LFL for this release, assuming urban topography, D stability and a wind speed of 3.0 m/s, was calculated to be <0.10 miles (<528 feet).  There were no public or environmental receptors identified by Landview III located within the 0.10 mile radius.\n\nD.     Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  Within the past five years, the Genpak - Middletown, NY facility has had no accidents that meet these requirements.\n\nE.
