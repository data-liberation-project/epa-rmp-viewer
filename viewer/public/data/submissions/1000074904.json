      "SummaryText": "Bellingham Cold Storage (BCS) owns and operates two cold storage facilities in Bellingham, WA. The Orchard St. facility, located at 600 W Orchard Dr, is a Cold Storage Warehouse for storage and distribution of frozen and chilled food products for various customers in Washington state, as well as other parts of the country. The Orchard St. facility employs approximately 60 people.\n\n \n\nBCS uses Anhydrous Ammonia on site for the refrigeration of products in storage. Ammonia is used for its excellent energy efficiency and refrigeration properties, the Ammonia at the facility is kept entirely within the refrigeration system. The Orchard St. facility has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that have affected residents or the environment. Since Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulations under 40 CFR 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions), BCS has implemented and follows a Process Safety Management program (PSM).\n\n\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40CFR68) and the PSM regulations, BCS developed and maintains a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  BCS has completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for the ammonia process using the What-If checklist methodology. The PHA was completed using technical Ammonia refrigeration staff as well as operations staff from the facility.\n\n\n\nBCS's implementation of the RMP/PSM programs includes, employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia process, as well as a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contra"

Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.\n\n  \n\nBCS is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Orchard St. facility, and is always looking for ways to improve the integrity of the NH3 system. Facility management is involved in the design, operation and maintenance of the system. BCS employees at all levels have been involved in the development and upgrading of the PSM and RMP programs. The BCS management team has committed to working with local agencies to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community.\n\n  \n\nSpecific questions regarding RMP compliance at BCS should be addressed to Douglas Thomas, President of Bellingham Cold Storage\n\n"
