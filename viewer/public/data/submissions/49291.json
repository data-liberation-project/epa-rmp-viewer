Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: We at Genpak, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Charlotte Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled: The facility manufactures disposable food trays. We have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is n-butane. N-Butane is actually a mixture of n-butane (95%) and isobutane (5%). In this document, the mixture is referred to as n-butane. The regulated substance at our facility, n-butane, is as a blowing agent in the manufacture of polystyrene food trays and containers. \n\n3. Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario: To perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and the model EPA Comp.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: Our facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This n-butane system was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard. The n-butane process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119."
