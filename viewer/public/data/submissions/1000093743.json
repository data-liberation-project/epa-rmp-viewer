      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Coyne Chemical - Reading Plant\r\n\r\nGeorge S. Coyne Chemical Co., Inc. is a chemical distributor serving the areas of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia.  In this capacity, Coyne is a re-seller of chemicals to industrial, commercial and municipal customers.  Of the current inventory consisting of approximately 100 types of chemicals, one is considered extraordinarily hazardous under the RMP regulations and is stored above the applicable threshold value.  The facility is located on approximately 4.25 acres and is bordered by a rail siding to the East, a water retention basin on the South, and two other industrial businesses to the North and West. Access can be made to the site by the only entrance off Witman Road on the Southwest side of the facility. \r\n\r\nThe chemical on site subject to RMP regulation is:\r\n\r\nChlorine (CAS # 7782-50-5)\r\n\r\nChlorine is also subject to the OSHA PSM regulations (29 CFR 1910.119)\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE IDENTIFICATION\r\n\r\nCoyne Chemical has identified the storage of the referenced material as the only stationary source at the facility.  \r\n\r\nChlorine is contained within pre-packaged cylinders containing 150 lbs. of product.  All full and empty cylinders are stored inside a dedicated storage room within the warehouse in storage racks with 16 cylinders per rack. The worst-case release scenario at the facility is a full cylinder release of a chlorine cylinder occurring outside of the facility during the unloading process. This scenario does not take into account any of the passive mitigating systems built into the storage process. Due to the fact that that the chlorine cylinders are stored in storage racks designed to house this type of cylinder, transported in the storage racks or individually secured within the transportation vehicle, and the loading and unloading step is the shortest step of the process, the worst-case scenario is not likely to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE"

Coyne Chemical Co., Inc. to have programs in place to identify and handle emergency response and public preparedness issues involving products handled at facilities operated by the company, in transit, and during storage and/or use at a customer's site. These programs address the following items deemed critical to achieving this goal:\r\n\r\nA.\tDocumentation, review, coordination and tests of emergency response plans.\r\nB.\tProcedures for response, reporting, investigation and implementation of preventative measures with respect to incidents which could have or did result in a release, explosion and/or fire.\r\nC.\tProcedures for supplying emergency response information regarding chemicals handled to emergency response agencies and communication with state and local emergency planning and response organizations regarding potential hazards of products handled at facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECURITY \r\n\r\nAn (8) eight-foot tall chain link fence equipped with barbed wire around the top protects the outside boundary of Coyne Chemical.  The Southwest gate serves as the main entrance for all traffic.  This gate is electrically controlled and cannot be opened from the outside without a pass card and remains closed at all times. There is a gate on the East side adjacent to the railroad tracks, but it is kept locked at all times.
