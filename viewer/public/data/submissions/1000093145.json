      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMARY\n\n\n\nSAN MIGUEL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC.\n\n\n\nSan Miguel Electric Cooperative, Inc. (San Miguel) was created on February 17, 1977 under the Rural Electric Cooperative Act of the State of Texas, for the purpose of owning and operating a 400 MW mine-mouth, lignite-fired generating plant and associated mining facilities which furnish power and energy to South Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. (STEC).\n\nBrazos Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. and STEC initiated construction of the plant as a joint venture in 1974. San Miguel purchased the plant and related mining facilities upon receiving long-term financing in 1978. Commercial operation of the plant began on January 7, 1982.\n\n\n\nThe generating plant is located in a rural area approximately six miles southeast of Christine, Texas in Atascosa County. The plant is fueled with lignite, which is mined from deposits in Atascosa and McMullen Counties.\n\n\n\nThe cooling system for the power station's turbine-generator and its auxiliaries utilizes a single mechanical draft cooling tower. The tower is constructed of wood and fiberglass and has eighteen cells. Biological fouling in the open recirculating, heat transfer system can be caused by excessive growth and development of algae, fungi, and bacteria. These types of biological deposits can severely reduce heat transfer efficiency if not controlled. Chlorine (Cl2), an oxidizing biocide is utilized to control the biological growth in the tower and associated heat exchangers. Chlorine is fed through a distribution header into the cooling tower basin.  \n\n\n\n"
