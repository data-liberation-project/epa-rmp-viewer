If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the unlaoding from truck, anhydrous ammonia, into our storage tanks and then to transfer from storage tanks into nurse tanks.  These nurse tanks are used by our farmer customers to apply nitrogen to their crops. The maximum quanity stored in our storage tanks is 56100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This location has 15 mobile nurse tanks with total possible storage of 70125 pounds, which would make the total location storage 126,225 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Total volume figured by water capacity at 85% with a density of 5.5 lbs/gallon NH3.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 56100 pounds, which represents the volume of our largest tank at 85% capacity, as limited by design standards.  The Local and County Emergency Management have been trained on how to react to a release.\nThe alternative release scenario based on industry records and the most likely potentail incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \n\nBecause our firm handels anhydrous ammonia, we are regulated by DOT, EPA, OSHA, and The Kansas Department of Agriculture, who inspects our facilities on an annual basis.  These regulation along with the extensive training and standards our company uses, has led us to an excellent safety record.  We have had reportable accidents with annhydrous ammonia in the last five years.  We are very proud of this record.  In the event we would have an ammonia release  we have an emergency response plan which "

In addition we have employees at our facility who are on the volunteer fire departmet which futher helps coordination of our response efforts.\n\nWe strive to maintain our excellent safety record by updating our employee training on an annual basis or as changes are made in the safety processes.
