To accomplish this the chlorine ton cylinders, pipe lines, fittings, and injectors are maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices, DOT regulations and using only parts, equipment and procedures that conform to Chlorine Institute's specifications.  Our operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine system are trained annually in the requirements of chlorine safety.\n\nDescription of Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant operation\nThe City of Port St. Joe operates a 2 mgd ground and surface water treatment plant. The WTP utilizes the following processes, lime softening, aeration, stabilization and chlorination after the treatment plant. Raw water for the treatment plant is obtained from two wells and a fresh water canal.\n\nDescription of chlorine system\nThe chlorine system consists of ton cylinders connected through an injector into the force main feeding the chlorine contact system. Chlorine feed rate is based on the need to maintain a residual chlorine concentration through out the potable water distribution system. Chlorine is withdrawn from the cylinder by vacuum through Wallace & Tiernan V-75 Chlorinator and no external vaporizer is used in the process. \n\nRMP requirements at the facility\nA review of all the materials used at the WTP has determined that chlorine is the only substance at or above a threshold quantity of an RMP regulated substance. The quantity of chlorine is enough to have a worst-case release scenario offsite impact thus a Program 2 level RMP has been developed.\n\nWorst-case release scenario\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that will be in the largest container on site at any one time will be 2,000 pounds. This is a single"

A worst-case release of any one cylinder will not cause an effect on the other cylinders. This will result in a distance to the endpoint is 3.0 miles using the Model Aloha 5.2.1\n\nAdministrative controls\nThere are no administrative controls on chlorine inventory in use at the facility that will effect the worst-case release scenario.\n\nPassive controls\nThere are no passive control measures in place at the facility.\n\nAlternative release scenario\nA cylinder is in service with a regulator in place. The regulator is hit causing the regulator to break off. This will result in a leak equal to the maximum withdrawal rate from the cylinder. Release quantity of chlorine will be 23.4 pounds or 0.39 pounds / minute and last for 60 minutes. The distance to the endpoint using the model ALOHA 5.2.1 is 125 yards. Under all conditions of alternative release scenarios there will be one house within the circke, this in occupied by the WTP operator.  \n\nFive-year accidental release history\nThere have been no RMP releases of chlorine within the five years of 1994 to date.  \n \nAccidental release prevention program\nAn OSHA PSM program is not required for this facility for chlorine. Our operators are trained in chlorine safety and correct operating procedures. The operators conduct inspection rounds of the WTP, including the chlorine system, to insure the WTP is operating correctly.  Any concerns, including safety of the chlorine process, are reported to the maintenance department so corrections can be made.\nOur maintenance employees are trained in chlorine safety and how to complete the required work.\n\nGeneral prevention activities\nThe facility has a staff of experienced and knowledgeable employees that receive refresher safety training annually. Each employee working with chlorine has the training and experience needed to approach a l"
