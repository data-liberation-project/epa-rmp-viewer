SunnyGem Juice Plant interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\r\n\r\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\r\n\r\nAny release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia systems depending on the location of the release. The Plant Manager is to be called if not on-site for reporting purposes. In turn, the ammonia refrigeration contractor would be notified to respond, mitigate and repair as needed.  Releases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the Maintenance Supervisor and Plant Manager, if not on-site, for instructions.\r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment on an ongoing basis.

The facility takes in raw pomegranates which they utilize to produce juice.  The anticipated production months are November thru January with production occurring 7 days a week.  The refrigeration system will run year around to keep freezer room temperatures for product quality and safety.  \r\n\r\nThe finished pomegranate juice is stored long term in 55-gallon drums in the freezer rooms.  The facility has the future goal of shipping product out of the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia is used to achieve temperature in the freezer rooms and used to cool a secondary coolant (glycol).\r\n\r\nThe facility is located in Kern County on a contiguous property. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the House Refrigeration System. The total ammonia inventory in the House System is 10,300 lbs. based weight ticket(s) from the initial ammonia delivery from Airgas.  The program was updated within the month and at this time, the estimated amount does exceed the Federal and State thresholds. \r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system is a direct mechanical refrigeration system. The refrigeration machine room / refrigeration system was built in 2016.

The Prevention Program implemented by SunnyGem Juice Plant is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\r\n\r\nKey objectives of SunnyGem Juice Plant's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\r\n\r\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by SunnyGem Juice Plant.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Mechanical Integrity Elements)\r\n\r\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation Elements.)\r\n\r\n4) Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  SunnyGem Juice Plant certifies operators following completion of operator training and SunnyGem Juice Plant's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training Element.)\r\n\r\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \r\n\r\nSecond, all SunnyGem Juice Plant employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities"

The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\r\n\r\nSee the Prevention Program Element 6 for the complete guidelines. \r\nThe supporting and completed documents are filed and maintained in the Maintenance Office.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review\r\nPre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems.

These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by SunnyGem Juice Plant's Management of Change Procedure. \r\n \r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, SunnyGem Juice Plant has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other hot work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a SunnyGem Juice Plant Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \r\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Startup Safety Review Elements.)\r\n\r\n7) Verification of SunnyGem Juice Plant's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by SunnyGem Juice Plant personnel.

As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\r\n\r\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and CUPA.\r\n\r\nSee the Prevention Program Element 10 for the complete guidelines. \r\nThe supporting and completed documents are filed and maintained in the Maintenance Office.\r\n\r\nHot Work and Safe Work Practices\r\nThis permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).

Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done.
