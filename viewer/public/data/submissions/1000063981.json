      "SummaryText": "Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Brundage Plant is a facility which receives raw natural gas from well production. The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants are removed. Marketable gas is delivered via pipelines. Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on-site. The extracted natural gas liquids include: propane, isobutane, butane, neopentane, isopentane, pentane, hexane, methane, and ethane. The natural gasoline mixture is delivered to the market via transportation vehicles. There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.  \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment/Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario for this facility is the entire contents of a 30,000-gallon propane bullet instantaneously releasing to the atmosphere. It is important to note that the propane bullets normally operate at 30% full; however, for conservative measures a 100% full propane bullet was modeled. EPA's RMP*Comp tool was used to calculate the impact of this release scenario. It was determined that this type of scenario is unlikely to occur as there are qualified individuals that operate and monitor this facility daily. The equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of such a release from occurring.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment/Alternative Release Scenario\n\nAn alternative release scenario was not explored for this facility as it falls under a EPA RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Brundage Plant is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors working in the facility, our neighbors, the surrounding community and the environment. This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation"

This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release. However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility in cooperation with local agencies are trained to respond, minimize and eliminate any exposure that would occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Brundage facility has a written emergency response procedure to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment. These procedures include response to a regulated substance release, evacuation, accounting for personnel and company and agency notification.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with local emergency responders including local law enforcement and the Duchesne County Fire and Emergency Management Office.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility. All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines. In addition to training required of all employees, personnel having responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are trained in those procedures.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements. Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of regulated substances at the facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility."
