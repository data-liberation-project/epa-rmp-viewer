      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) facilities to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.\n\n\n\nThe LAAFP facilities complex consists of four different chlorination stations and one chemical depot: (1) the LAAFP facility; (2)  the Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station (LAROCS); (3) the Van Norman Chemical Depot (VNCD); (4) the Van Norman Chloramination Station # 1 (VNCS#1); and (5) the Van Norman Chloramination Station #2 (VNCS#2). The LAAFP facilities chlorine handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe LADWP updated and submitted the RMP for all the above five chlorination stations in June 2014. Subsequent to the submission of the RMP in June 2014, the LADWP made modifications to the LA Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station. Modifications to the LAROCS were completed in January 2016 and the updated RMP was submitted in July 2016. The July 2016 RMP demonstrated co"

The 25-ton bulk tank is the largest vessel (container) online. \n\nThe station is equipped with a dry media chlorine main scrubber of one-ton capacity.

The permit indicates the dates the work is authorized for, the location, and specific operational requirements, and it is kept on file in the administrative office. \n\n\n\nThe LADWP Management of Change procedures include steps required to be taken by plant personnel before implementing changes to chlorination equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.  Training, process safety information, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are updated according to the changes made.\n\n\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nThe LADWP has been certifying every three years (or earlier) that compliance with Program 3 Prevention Program requirements for the chlorination stations are met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed. \n\n\n\nThe compliance audit consists of separating the RMP program elements or sections, and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness. For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance Audit Checklist. The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader. The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element and contain questions that may assist with the auditing process. The audit checklist for each element consists of the following three sections:\n\n\n\n?    Records Review: A review of the RMP written Prevention Program.\n\n?    On-Site Conditions: The audit team reviews the program elements based on observation of the plant conditions and safety practices.\n\n?    Interviews:  The program elements are evaluated by interviewing personnel from appropriate functions including operations, maintenance, management, and contractors.\n\n\n\nCompliance Auditor records RMP program deficiencies identified during the audit on the checklist.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigat"

The incident investigation is started promptly but no later than 48 hours after the event. The LADWP promptly addresses and resolves all recommendations and implements the recommendations in a timely manner to prevent an incident recurrence. All incident investigation reports are retained in the LADWP's file for at least a period of five years from the date the reports are completed.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\n\n\nNo chlorine release that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the LAAFP, VNCD, VNCS#1 or VNCS#2 chlorination stations during the last five-years. However, an accident involving chlorine occurred on June 5, 2017 at the Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station.\n\nThe chlorine release occurred due to a loose connection between the flexible connector and the liquid chlorine header valve. One employee was exposed to chlorine and was transported to a local hospital. He was released on the same day. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\n\n\nThe LADWP is a first responder, its employees respond to chlorine accidental release. In the event an accidental release that could result in offsite consequences occurs, external resources, such as the City of Los Angeles Fire Department will also be solicited to respond.  \n\n\n\nAs part of the emergency response program, the LADWP has developed and implemented an emergency response plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment. The following elements are included:\n\n\n\n(a)    Emergency response plan, maintained at each facility, including the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) containing:\n\n\n\n?    Organizational structure (chain-of-command) and responsibilities of various LADWP personnel.\n\n?    Procedures for planning and c"

Based on 2014 PHAs, additional recommendations were made to improve chlorine safety. All the above recommendations were evaluated by the LADWP. Subsequent to the submission of the RMP in June 2014, the LADWP made significant process changes at the LA Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station. PHA for the LAROCS was again performed in March 2016 after the final upgrade of the LAROCS was completed.
