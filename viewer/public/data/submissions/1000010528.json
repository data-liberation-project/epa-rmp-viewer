      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n \n\n11.0\tSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Hiland Dairy in Norman, Oklahoma is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store milk and related dairy products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 16,600 pounds (i.e., 3,300 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 5,700 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains only 3,200 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some piping runs are located outdoors.  The Norman plant is located in an urban setting.\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration at the Norman plant is a two-stage system consisting of a high (pressure) side and a low (pressure) side.\nThe storage freezers operate on the low side (low pressure and, therefore, low temperature).  Ammonia suction from the units, at about 0 psig, is transferred directly to the booster compressors.  The booster discharge passes throu"

The accumulator receives suction from the flooded system for the new milk cooler load units.\nDischarge from the high side compressors (hot gas) is vented to four roof-mounted condensors.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrost of various load units.\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to either the high side load units or to the low pressure liquid accumulator.  The liquid passes through a liquid cooler before entering the low pressure liquid recirculator.\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  These include pressure relief valves, engine room ventilation, and safety interlocks.\nSafety relief valves (SRVs) protect the compressor discharge, condensors, suction accumulators, and intercooler.  SRVs on the compressor discharge and condensors are set a 250 psig.  SRVs for the suction vessels are set at 150 psig.\nSafety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature cut-outs for the compressors, as well as high level floats and/or sensors for the vessels.  If a discharge pressure of 180 psig is reached in the system, an alarm sounds.  If the pressure continues to rise to 210 psig, the compressors and boosters are shut down.  If the intermediate pressure increases to 30 psig, an alarm also sounds.  If the pressure continues to rise to 40 psig, the boosters are shut down.\nFloat switches on the suction vessels alarm when a high level is reached.  If the liquid level continues to rise, additional float switches and/or level control shut off the appropriate compressors or boosters to avoid slugging.\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valve"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.

The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia.\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for employees, coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of the facility.  The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refers to other pertinent elements of the management system (i.e., standard operating procedures).\n \n5.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe prevention program that is described in Section 2.0 of this Executive Summary is a management system that is designed to proactively identify, evaluate, and reduce the potential for a ammonia release and/or a release's impact or consequence, due to failures in process, procedures, and equipment.  As safety improvements are identified by the management system they are evaluated and, where appropriate, implemented.  For example, the facility may implement the following changes to further improve the safety of the process:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAdditional training,\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPeriodic repair and replacement of equipment, and\n\u00c2\u00bf\tContinued implementation and improvement of the PSM program."
