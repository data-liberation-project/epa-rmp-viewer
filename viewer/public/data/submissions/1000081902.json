(Seymour) facility in Sycamore, Illinois, aerosol propellant is stored and injected into spray paint canisters.  The propellant mixture consists of approximately 63 percent propane and 37 percent n-butane.  Dimethyl Ether (DME) is also used as a propellant.  The properties that make the propellant valuable in the manufacturing process also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the health and safety threat to employees, contractors, and nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon:\n\n\n\nA. The manner in which propellant is handled;\n\nB. The safety devices inherent in the design of our propellant system;\n\nC. The safe handling procedures we use; and \n\nD. The training of our personnel\n\n\n\nEmergency response procedures include notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The propellant system is enclosed within a chain-linked fence to help keep it secure.\n\n\n\nSeymour has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of aerosol propellant (A80, B80 or NP80) and dimethyl ether.  This facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  Seymour uses real time databases to track training, maintenance, and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emerge"

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 32551.  This facility is capable of producing and packaging aerosol spray paint canisters.\n\n\n\nSeymour has three regulated substances as specified in 40 CFR Part 68, propane, n-butane, and dimethyl ether (DME) at this location.  The propane and the n-butane exist as a propellant mixture known as A80, B80 or NP80.  This mixture and DME are used as propellants in aerosol spray paint canisters.  \n\n\n\nThe threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR Part 68 for propane and n-butane is 10,000 pounds each.  The entire quantity of the propellant mixture stored on site is approximately 567,350 pounds.  Approximately 148,848 pounds is kept in storage tanks and 418,502 pounds in finished goods storage.  The propellant mixture consists of 63 percent propane and 37 percent n-butane.  The corresponding quantities of these substances are approximately 357,305 pounds of propane and 210,045 pounds of n-butane.  \n\n\n\nThe threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR Part 68 for dimethyl ether (DME) is 10,000 pounds.  Approximately 39,000 pounds of DME is kept in storage tanks and another 3000 pounds in finished goods storage.  \n\n\n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nFor this propellant mixture, Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance is required.  The OSHA PSM program is the basis for the RMP prevention program.  Seymou"

Seymour's PSM program has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.\n\n\n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n\n\n1. Seymour holds monthly safety meetings to ensure that all employees review new safety policies and that every employee receives safety training.\n\n\n\n2. The facility has an employee suggestion program that allows employees to provide input concerning the effectiveness of safety procedures.\n\n\n\n3. Seymour maintains good training, certifications and employee awareness programs.\n\n\n\n4. New employees receive mandatory New Employee Orientation within 5 days of becoming employed at Seymour of Sycamore. Typically the training is completed on the new employee's first day.\n\n\n\n5. The facility has a \"Management of Change\" policy that requires that any change that is not a \"replacement-in-kind\" must be reviewed for potential hazards in might introduce.\n\n\n\n6. The mechanical integrity program is in-place to ensure that process equipment is designed, constructed, installed, operated, and maintained properly to minimize the risk of release of hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\n7.

Compliance audits are performed to ensure compliance to identify areas of safety improvement.\n\n\n\n4.0 Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: April 21, 2009 through June 26,2014. To date, there have been no accidental spills or releases of propellant at the facility.\n\n\n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed a Chemical Safety and Contingency Plan in which plant employees and contractors are trained on the plan and how it affects them.
