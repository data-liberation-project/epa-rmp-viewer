The only material considered hazardous at this facility is aqua (a 20 wt% solution of ammonia in water).  \n\n\n\nOur facility has three atmospheric-pressure 30,000 gallon tanks for storing aqua, equipment for receiving aqua by truck and equipment for transferring aqua from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  \n\n\n\nIt is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling aqua.  This includes diking our storage facility to contain any spills and thereby prevent soil and water contamination and minimize ammonia release from any spills.
