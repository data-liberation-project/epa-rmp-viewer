The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 133202 SR 26 in Colfax, Washington (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the forms of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure and aqueous ammonia.  There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank into applicators that are immediately removed from the facility for delivery to customers.  The contents of the applicators are sold and delivered to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \n\n\n\nThere is one aqueous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of 35,000 gallons.  The aqueous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank to a tanker with a capacity of 3,000 gallons.  The contents of the tanker are sold to the local farming community for use "

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Colfax Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n"

Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits, hazard reviews, and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site inspection conducted by an outside contractor.  The Branch Manager is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1. Update emergency shutdown section of operating procedures to include specific references to valves and couplings. \n\n2. Modify the daily in season inspection form to include end of day check to ensure valves are locked before site personnel leave for the day. \n\n3. Order a sign that meets requirements and install on side of building or posts. \n\n4. Update written operating procedures or RMP data to reflect site specific information regarding colors. \n\n5. Evaluate the flexible lines serving the system are within  manufacturer specifications for offsets and length. \n\n6. Install a wind sock at facility. \n\n7. Modify the semi-annual nurse tank inspection form to be semi-annual mobile equipment form. \n\n\n\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describes methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficien"
