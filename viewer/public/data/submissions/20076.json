Facility accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n     Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Waterworks (TPCW) District No.1 pledges to protect the environment and the health and safety of employees and the community in which we operate.  As a public body, we recognize the continuing challenge of fulfilling this pledge while accomplishing our goals.  Each of us shares this responsibility to ensure our long-term success.  To achieve our goals, we will:\n     a. Commit to leadership by operating and growing our business in compliance with legal requirements and TPCW District No. 1 environmental, health and safety operating standards, which may be more stringent.\n     b. Safeguard our employees' health by promoting an accident-free workplace, minimizing exposure to hazardous substances, and providing preventive health care systems.\n     c. Promote safe handling, use and disposal of our products by acquiring and communicating information and education to our employees and customers.\n     d. Minimize the environmental impact of our operations by promoting pollution prevention and environmental conservation.\n     e. Anticipate, evaluate and manage risks by maintaining crisis management programs that emphasize prevention and effective emergency preparedness, response and recovery plans.\n     f. Commit to continuous improvement by monitoring compliance with regulations and our internal standards and by striving for performance, which compares favorably with industry leaders.\n     g. Earn the public trust by communicating openly about our policies, programs and performance and advocating sound laws and regulations.\n\n2. Facility description and regulated substances handled:\n     The Schriever Water Treatment Plant provides drinking water to Terrebonne Parish.  The facility has a treatment capacity of 16-million gals/day.  On average, the facility treats approximately 12-million gals/day. \n     At this facility, chlorine is th"

The average inventory includes eight (8) one-ton (2,000 lb.) containers and five (5) 150-lb. cylinders, for a total of 16,750-lbs.  The maximum inventory includes ten (10) one-ton (2,000 lb.) containers and eight (8) 150-lb. cylinders, for a total of 21,200-lbs.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario's:\n     The worst-case release scenario is failure of a one-ton (2,000 lb.) chlorine container resulting in a direct release.  An estimated fifty-five percent (1,100 lbs.) of the contents would be released in 10-minutes (110 lbs./min.).  The resulting radius to the toxic endpoint (ERPG-2) is 2.20 miles, with an estimated population of 2,800 people.\n     The alternative release scenario is based on failure of a 1-inch schedule 80 pipe connected to three (3) one-ton (2,000 lb.) chlorine containers resulting in a release of gas.  It is assumed that the release is limited by the flow of gas through the 5/16-inch valves on each of the 1-ton containers, rather than through a 1-inch pipe, and that 1,053-lbs. is released over 30-minutes (estimated release rate = 35.1 lbs./min.).  The resulting radius to the toxic endpoint (ERPG-2) is 0.20 miles, with an estimated population of 22 people.\n     Passive mitigation, enclosure of chlorine process area, was considered in the release scenario.  No active mitigation measures were considered.  The release scenario is based on location in a rural area.\n     The American Water Works Association (AWWA) Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants manual was used for reference in preparing the RMProgram submittal.  RMP*Comp (Ver. 1.06) was used to perform the offsite consequence analyses.  LandView .III mapping software was used to obtain census data for the release scenario.\n\n4.

Five year accident history:\n     There were no reportable accidents in the last five (5) years.\n\n6. The emergency response program:\n     In the event of an accident or incident involving the facilities chlorine system, the first responder will notify the Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government (TPCG) Office of Emergency Preparedness and request that they respond to the emergency.  The TPCG Office of Emergency Preparedness is the primary response service and will work with Fire and Law Enforcement personnel to minimize effects of a hazardous material (HAZMAT) incident.  Depending on the severity of the incident, additional local, state, federal and private resources may be called upon to assist in HAZMAT response.  \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:   \n     No changes to improve safety have been reviewed at this time."
