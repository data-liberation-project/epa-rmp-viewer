Both scenarios included acetylene as this is the only product that falls under the guidelines.  For both scenarios, the endpoint is within 0.2 mile from the plant.  The public receptors within the 0.2 mile radius of the plant are a lime storage and sales facility and a residential house.  Both are located on Western International property.\r\n\r\nD. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nWestern complies with the OSHA PSM regulations and NFPA 51A guidelines. \r\n\r\nWestern takes pride in having done it right the first time before an accident or incident would require any form of additional safety measures.  This facility has multiple gas monitors throughout the production areas and fire detectors.  The monitors are set to alarm at 10 % of the lower explosive limit (LEL).  If any two alarms reach 20% of the LEL at the same time, it will completely shut down the entire plant.  Our system will also not allow an override of this safety feature requiring the problem to be fixed immediately or the system will not start back up.  \r\n\r\nE.  The five year accident history:\r\nNo accidents to report in the last five years. \r\n \r\nF.  The emergency response program:\r\nCoordination of Emergency Response for this facility consists of tours taken by the Bellville Fire Department and Local EMS system.  Western's Safety and Compliance Director is actively involved in the local LEPC.  Western invites the local Fire Department to our facility as part of their training program to familiarize them with our facility and products.  These tours and training received count as required hours the Fire Department members to remain certified. \r\n\r\nAll Western personnel also receive training on emergency response.  Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually or whenever a change in process"
