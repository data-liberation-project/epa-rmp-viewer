If an accidental release should occure, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and transferd for distribution for crop production nutrients.The maximum quanity stored would be 105,000 pound in our 24,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as  a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 105,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.22 miles. The alternative release scenario based on industry records and most likely to occur is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint   (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\nThe facility is heavily regulated by DOT, EPA, OSHA  and The Kansas Department of Agriculture, who inspects each of our facilities on an annual basis. We are in compliance with the provisions of ANSI K-61 which are the requirements and standards for ammonia facilities. Because of the oversight and the committement to safety our firm has demonstrated we have attained an outstanding safety record. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has an emergency action plan and has participated in the "
