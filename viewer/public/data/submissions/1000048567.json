This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Olathe Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have one extremely hazardous substance present at our facility that is subject to the Process Safety and Risk Management Planning regulations.  That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present at this facility, based upon process and operational requirements is 17,278 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. has taken the following steps as required by 40CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to the EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right To Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. believes that process safety management and accident prevention require a team effort.

The process safety information is documented in the PSM/RMP release prevention program for all refrigeration equipment and ancillary systems.  The information is documentation to assure recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices for this process meets the industry standards.\n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. uses the What-If Checklist method of Process Hazard Analysis to identify and correct any issues that can affect the safety and/or mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A team of personnel representing engineering, construction, operations, safety, management and labor convene at least every 5 years to complete or revise the Process Hazard Analysis.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.
