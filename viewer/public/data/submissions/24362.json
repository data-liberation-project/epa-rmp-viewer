Johanna Foods, Inc. has operated its ammonia\n\nrefrigeration system following its RMP Program. The RMP Program\n\nwas developed in 1991 to comply with New Jersey's Toxic\n\nCatastrophe Prevention Act. The Standard Operating Procedures,\n\nPreventative Maintenance Program, Management of Change Program,\n\nEmergency Response Plan, and other elements of the RMP Program\n\nhave developed over the years to further improve the safety,\n\nreliability, and risk reduction of the ammonia refrigeration\n\nsystem.\n\n\n\n                      Johanna Foods, Inc.\n\n\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has three production plants on one site.\n\nThe Juice Plant packages chilled juice products in half gallon,\n\nquart and pint paper containers that require refrigeration for\n\nprocessing and storage. The Aseptic Plant packages juice products\n\nin Brik Pak containers (drink boxes) in a variety of sizes and\n\nflavors that requires refrigeration for processing but not for\n\nstorage. The Yogurt Plant packages yogurt products in cup\n\ncontainers of various sizes, styles, and flavors that require\n\nrefrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is\n\nthe regulated chemical that is used as the refrigerant. The\n\nquantity of anhydrous ammonia contained in the refrigeration\n\nsystem  on site varies up to 55,000 pounds. The anhydrous ammonia\n\nis not consumed or produced by the refrigeration system. The\n\nrefrigeration system circulates the anhydrous ammonia converting\n\nit from a liquid to a vapor to create cooling, then condensing\n\nthe vapor back to a liquid to be used again.\n\n\n\n                  Worst-case Release Scenario\n\n\n\n     The worst-case release scenario assumed that the largest\n\nvessel in the refrigeration system, the receiver, was 95% full of\n\nanhydrous ammonia.

However, Land View 3 averages the total population of\n\nthe county area and produces the number of people per square\n\nmile.

To the south is woods and farmland.\n\nTo the west is woods and sparse housing. The actual number of\n\npeople effected would be less than 1419.\n\n\n\n                  Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\n     The alternative release scenario is also the refrigeration\n\nsystem receiver. The worst-case release scenario assumed the\n\nreceiver being 95% full. This would be a very abnormal condition\n\nfor the receiver. The normal operating level of the receiver is\n\n15% to 25% full. For the alternative release scenario the normal\n\noperating level of the receiver at 25% full, 10,000 pounds, was\n\nused with a hole or puncture of three square inches. The release\n\nrate would be 362 pounds per minute and would last about 30\n\nminutes. This scenario was also analyzed using RMP*Comp Ver.\n\n1.06. The estimated distance to toxic endpoint of .14 mg/L\n\nreached .2 miles. It was estimated using Land View 3 that this\n\nwould effect 27 people.

The Standard\n\nOperating Procedures are used for every task performed on the\n\nrefrigeration system. All equipment is checked daily using\n\nchecksheets from the S.O.P.'s Steady State Operations section.\n\nThe Preventative Maintenance Program requires checksheets to\n\ninspect all refrigeration equipment in greater detail every six\n\nmonths, yearly testing of all safety interlocks and controls, and\n\na five year schedule to replace safety relief valves. Any repairs\n\nrequired by the inspections are tracked with a PC based Work\n\nOrder System. Any modification to the system is performed\n\nfollowing the Management of Change Program. The M.O.C. requires a\n\ndispersion analysis to determine if the change could cause\n\noffsite impact or not. Offsite impact would result in performing\n\na risk assessment of the change to identify all hazards and items\n\nto further reduce the risk of a release. All EHS operators are\n\ntrained in all aspects of the RMP and annual refresher training\n\nis performed high lighting any changes to procedures or\n\nequipment.\n\n\n\n                   Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\n     There have been no accidents.\n\n\n\n                    Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan that\n\naddresses emergency situations including an anhydrous ammonia\n\nrelease.

There are procedures to follow for\n\nanyone how discovers a potential release to notify the Johanna\n\nFoods, Inc. guard shack.

The ERT members at\n\nthe effected area don SCBAs and perform a search of the effected\n\narea. The ERC radios the EVC by radio for the result of the\n\nheadcount and informs the response team of any missing personnel\n\nto search for.

Once all\n\npersonnel and accounted for the EHS operators of the ERT start to\n\nisolate the release and monitor the area. The ERT is made up of\n\nEHS operators, production operators who have first aid training,\n\nand various maintenance personnel to assist in an emergency. Site\n\npersonnel are trained annually on the evacuation procedures. The\n\nERT is trained annually on the procedures of the Emergency\n\nResponse Plan and the use of Emergency Response Equipment.
