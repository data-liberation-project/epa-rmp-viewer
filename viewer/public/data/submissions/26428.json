Anhydrous ammonia is received,by transport truck and rail, transferred and stored, and distributed as fertilizer to our farmer-customers.  The maximum quantity stored at any time is 300,000 lbs., or a 100 ton rail car filled to 80% capacity connected to a  30,000 gallon bulk storage tank filled to 88% capacity. \n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia  which is considered hazardous by EPA. We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of these products at our facilities.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia is based on the ANSI K-61.1 standard, Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, and the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated response actions with the White Post Township Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training, and has verified that the C"

The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck   transports and rail, and stored in 1  tank.  This   facility has equipment for unloading truck   transports and rail, and equipment to load nurse tanks and truck transports. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, customers, and authorized contractors. \n\n     The regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is  anhydrous ammonia. \n\n       The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 300,000 pounds. The maximum quantity handled would be 300,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nProduct: anhydrous ammonia\n     Worst case Scenario: Release of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank filled to 88% maximum capacity coupled to the rail car containing 160,000 pounds would be released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 300,000  pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.55 miles. Due to the location of the tank there would be a significant impact to surrounding areas.\n      Alternative Release Scenario: Based on a potential incident of the failure of a 2 inch hose during product transfer operations. The distance to the endpoint  (point of 200 ppm dispersion) is 1.18 miles. The amount of anhydrous ammonia released would be 11,908 pounds.\n\n4.

The facility's  anhydrous ammonia plant has  implemented portions of  the ANSI K-61.1 standard, Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, and the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; periodic inspections by the Indiana State Chemists Office are also conducted. Employees involved in anhydrous ammonia activities are trained thoroughly by our Safety Coordinator, contractor and insurance companies, and industry experts; an annual formal refresher course as well as periodic training is also provided.  \n  The major hazards identified with anhydrous ammonia include toxic release, stress corrosion, overfilling, equipment failure, earthquake, and tornado. Process controls, such as relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, alarms and procedures, and excess flow devices are utilized to minimize the potential for release. \n  Mitigation systems available include a deluge or water curtain provided by the responding fire department in the event of a release which would knock down the vapor cloud and neutralize the ammonia. In addition,  passive mitigation systems limiting the filling of tanks to 88% capacity (through tank gauges and onsite personnel) are utilized.\n  Employees are trained on an initial and ongoing basis. Employee Training is provided as well as periodic refresher training available from our Safety Coordinator, industry seminars, and vendor programs. Competency is measured through written and oral testing, demonstration (hands-on), and observation.\n   Maintenance programs are in place. Items are replaced if they fail, present a risk to the user, are required by law or standard, are out-of-date,  or if a system or process is changed or upgraded.
