      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\r\nThe current Risk Management Program (RMP) program for the Southside Plant has proven successful for the 2009-2014 reporting. The implemented programs activities have strongly improved not only the equipment safety components but it also improves the employee safety awareness when working with chemicals. The results of the program's activities implementations exceeded expectations. The training of the personnel have significantly enhanced their chemical uses and safety knowledge. They now have a better understanding of the dangers and the risks involved when working with hazardous chemicals. They can be highly depended on what precautions to take when involved on a chemical spill. We are pleased  to report that no chemical incidents were recorded during this reporting period for this particular plant.\r\n\r\nThe Southside Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored exceeds the threshold limit specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed a RMP contains the following required information:\r\nA\u00bf\tA management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\r\nA\u00bf\tA hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternative release scenarios and their impacts on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B);\r\nA\u00bf\tA prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C); and\r\nA\u00bf\tAn emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\r\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the Plant.\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe plant has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine.

      "SummaryText": "this facility ensure that there will be emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the Laredo Fire Department HAZMAT team, in the event of an emergency.   In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the Laredo Fire Department.  \r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe plant uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  \r\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n The Southside WWTP is located in Laredo, Texas.  Two distinct and independently operated activated sludge process trains are used to treat wastewater.  \r\nThe existing chlorine facilities at the Southside WWTP consist of a general storage and process area.  One-ton chlorine containers are stored in the area, and the nearby process area is comprised of chlorine feed equipment, including chlorinators and rotameters as well as piping, miscellaneous valves, and vacuum regulators.  On treatment plant grounds, the potential to generate a release of chlorine gas exists at the storage and process area. \r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe plant performs consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine equipment, utilizing only fully trained personnel.  The management ensures consistent operation by using disciplinary measures for operational deviations. \r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe accident history for the Southside WWTP was reviewed for the period from December 2004 through December 2009.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine occurred.  \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nManagement of this facility has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees will be trained in the initial response to a release.  The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Plant operators are required to make rounds for inspection and monitoring of the plant processes at least once every two hours.  Once a leak is detected, the Laredo Fire Departmen"

The most notable planned changes include the following: \r\nA\u00bf\tConsider the need for an automatic shutoff switch.  This switch would be useful during an emergency when the chlorine supply has to be shutoff immediately.  A remote switch would eliminate the danger associated with plant personnel having to manually shutdown the chlorine system.  Emergency shutdown procedures should be developed and implemented in the training sessions.\r\nA\u00bf\tWhen the plant facilities are expanded or upgraded in the future management will consider the design and construction of a containment building to isolate the storage areas from the process areas.  Additional consideration will be given to the capability to chemically neutralize any accidental releases of chlorine."
