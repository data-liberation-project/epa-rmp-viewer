Two release scenarios were modeled: a Worst-Case scenario involving the total loss of inventory and an alternative high-pressure gas release (the most common cause of Anhydrous Ammonia releases nationwide).  Each scenario includes population impacts and a map showing the potential sphere of influence.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Management Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\t\r\nGillespie Ag Service has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Standards 29 CFR Part 1910.119 Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals, and California's Accidental Release Prevention requirements set forth by CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.
