      "SummaryText": "\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nA. Introduction\n\nThe Hartsville plant is an ammoniated fertilizer production facility that either unloads 44.8% nitrogen solution (25% aqua ammonia) railcars into storage tanks or uses it directly from the railcar.  The nitrogen solution is then used in the production of granular ammoniated fertilizers.  The facility has been in operation since the 1920's and started as a pulverized fertilizer plant.  The original plant, built by Hartsville Fertilizer Company, was purchased by International Agricultural Corporation (IAC) in 1931.  In 1944 a fire destroyed the plant.  The plant was rebuilt and started production in 1946. The plant has manufactured ROP superphosphate since its inception and still does so today.    \n\nThe plant site consists of 38  acres of land.  The plant currently employs 50 people and maintains three shifts, which work five to seven days per week, depending on production demands. \n \nThe Hartsville Plant has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process.\n\nThe facility safety record is a direct result of much emphasis on safety in the plant on the part of management and employees. \n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\nThe Hartsville, SC EHS administrator furnishes technical assistance and performs safety and environmental audits and training on a regular basis.\n\nThe solution tanks and associated equipment is covered by a mechanical integrity inspection and testing schedule and is constantly monitored. \n\nSafety meetings for all employees are held at the facility.  In addition to safety training classes, each employee has taken numerous computer-based safety training courses. All supervisory positions and Hazmat employees are certified in First Aid and CPR.\n\nManagement personnel are actively involved in promoting safety and environmental awareness in the community through participation with the LEPC and coordination with the Fire Dep"

      "SummaryText": "artment.\n\n\nC. Emergency Response Policies and Program:\n\nThe Hartsville granulation facility employees are trained to be familiar with the Emergency Response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other plant safety meetings.  All plant personnel have received eight hours of awareness level training as directed by 29 CFR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed on an annual basis as part of the employee safety meetings to ensure refresher training.  Safety policies and procedures are also reviewed on an annual basis or more often if required.  These policies and procedures are also revised to stay in compliance with changing government regulations\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is followed in the event of an emergency.  Included in this plan is the testing of the emergency system each month.\n\nLocal LEPC and the Hartsville Fire Department personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Response Plan and invited to tour the facility and participate in response drills on a regular basis.\n\nThe facility Emergency Response Plan covers such things as accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, and emergency response practices and procedures.  The plan is reviewed annually with all employees as well as with the local fire department. \n\nThe Hartsville facility maintains a Hazardous Materials Response Team whose duty is to respond to chemical emergencies at the plant.  The team members are also trained as Confined Space Rescue Personnel. The Hazardous Materials Response Team is a volunteer group and has received an initial forty hour training with eight hours of refresher training annually.  The Hazardous Materials Response Team has coordinated training with the local fire department on several occasions.\n\nD. Five Year Accident History:\n\nHartsville has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its personnel or contractors as a result of the RMP covered process. In addition, there have been no accidents resulting "

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe Hartsville plant continuously looks for ways to enhance the safety of the plant.  Plant personnel inspect the plant monthly, and the environmental, health and safety department conducts an annual Royster-Clark review.\n \nF. Summary:  \n\nThe employees are extremely proud of its safety record and the vast improvements in both safety and environmental efforts made over the last twenty years.  We believe that with the programs and policies in place, and the continued efforts of 100% of our personnel, we will be able to maintain our safety record and a safe plant environment for all concerned in the years ahead."
