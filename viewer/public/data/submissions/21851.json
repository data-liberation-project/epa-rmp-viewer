If an accidental release should \n                     occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,\n                     or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of\n                     the release to people and the environment.\n\n             2.   Facility Information\n\n\n                   The primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage and \n                    blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  The primary activity of our\n                    propane facilities is the storage and resale of propane to our member patrons.\n\n                   Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct\n                   application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production \n                   nutrients.  Propane is stored and delivered to member patrons for use in\n                   in heating and grain drying.\n\n\n                    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in a 30,000 gallon capacity\n                     tank at 85% full is 131,325# at the Blencoe, IA facility.\n\n\n                    The maximum quantity of propane stored in a 28,000 gallon capacity tank at 85%\n                    full is 99,996# at the Blenc"

The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the\n                     release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10\n                     minutes.

The distance to the endpoint (point of 200 PPM)\n                     is 2.4 miles at the location with the largest storage.
