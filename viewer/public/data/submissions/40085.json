The program covers industrial facilities having more than a threshold quantity of certain specified hazardous or flammable chemicals.\n\nThe program focuses on chemical release prevention, detection, and accident response, and requires each facility to develop and implement a site-specific risk management plan including a hazards assessment, an accident prevention program and an emergency response plan.  The program requires facilities to review worst case release scenarios no matter how unlikely those scenarios may be, and identify ways to minimize impacts from such releases.\n\nThe Zeeland Chemicals facility currently has two processes covered under this program.  The covered processes are as follows:\n?    On-site storage and usage of methyl chloride, which is a primary raw material in the manufacture of certain chlorinated quaternary ammonium compounds.\n?    On-site storage and usage of ethylene, a primary raw material in the manufacture of a co-polymer product which has final application in photographic film.\n\nZeeland Chemicals is committed to minimizing the risk of adverse impacts from its operations, and our commitment to responsible operations is built directly into our business objectives.  This commitment is manifested further in our use of sound operating and maintenance practices, use of safety-conscious designs as well as extensive employee training.  In addition, the performance of periodic safety audits and incident investigations are designed to review and minimize risks to employees, the environment, and the community.\n\nZeeland Chemicals continually strives to be an industry leader in environmental stewardship.

We make consistent, measurable progress in implementing this commitment throughout our operations. \n\nOur focus on continuous improvement in the areas of safety, health, and environmental affairs is also demonstrated by our commitment to the Synthetic and Organic Chemical Manufacturers? Association (SOCMA) Responsible Care initiative.  Zeeland Chemicals has voluntarily adopted Responsible Care as its environmental, health and safety code of ethics.  We measure our success by our record of improvement in safety performance, reductions in waste and emissions, and involvement with the community.\n\nCOMPANY HISTORY\n\nIn 1935, a company named Chemical Specialties, Inc. was formed to manufacture the bulk active sedative Carbromal for the US market.  This company operated at the Centennial Avenue location where Zeeland Chemicals, Inc. has now operated.  Chemical Specialties, Inc., a privately held company, owned and operated the plant from 1935 to 1947.  Miles Laboratories, Inc. owned and operated a unit at the same location from 1947 to 1977.  Hexcel Corporation owned and operated a division at the same location from 1977 to 1992.  Cambrex Corporation owned and operated a division (Zeeland Chemicals, Inc.) at the same location from 1992 to 2003.\n\nZeeland Chemicals, a division of Rutherford Chemicals, LLC, has owned and operated the manufacturing plant since 2003 and provides the pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries with the highest quality active ingredients, intermediates, chiral synthons, resolving agents, and services. Our facility is registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and we maintain systems for full compliance with the US FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) guidelines.

It is a chemical industry initiative through which companies commit to a continuous effort to improve their responsible management of chemicals.  The program began in Canada in the late 1980s and has since spread across the globe.  It has rapidly become the single most important performance improvement program within the chemical industry. \n\nIn adopting Responsible Care, Zeeland Chemicals has agreed to conduct its business according to the following principles: \n\n?    To recognize and respond to community concerns about chemicals and our operations.\n?    To develop and produce chemicals that can be manufactured, transported and disposed of safely\n?    To make health, safety and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new products and processes.\n?    To report promptly to officials, employees, customers and the public, information on chemical related health or environmental hazards and to recommend proactive measures.\n?    To counsel customers on the use, transportation and disposal of chemical products.\n?    To operate our plants and facilities in a manner that protects the environment, health and safety of our employees and the public.\n?    To extend knowledge by conducting or supporting research on the health, safety and environmental effects of our products, processes and waste material.\n?

To promote the principles and practices of Responsible Care by sharing experiences and offering assistance to others who produce, handle, use, transport or dispose of chemicals.\n\nWhile these principles give shape to Responsible Care, they require supporting action.  All Responsible Care signatories agree to enact seven codes of management practice.  Zeeland Chemicals is proud of its record of accomplishment in this regard by having implemented all seven codes.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nZeeland Chemicals has worked hard to ensure that our products and manufacturing operations meet or exceed industry standards of excellence for protecting both the community and the environment.  As a socially responsible company, we have set aggressive goals to continue improving our EH&S performance into the next decade.  It is through these efforts that our initiatives have helped us protect and enhance health and safety -- for our employees, neighbors and the public.  As a result, we are proud of our record of accomplishment in not having had an accidental off-site release of any of the 112(r) regulated substances within the last ten (10) years.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAs stated previously, the Zeeland Chemicals facility has two processes covered under the 112(r) program.  The first process utilizes ethylene as a raw material in the production of a copolymer and the second process utilizes methyl chloride that is used as primary raw material in the manufacture of chlorinated quaternary ammonium compounds.\n\nEthylene is being used in the manufacture of an ethylene/maleic anhydride (EMA) co-polymer product that is used in the glass fiber industry.  The ethylene is stored under pressure in one (1) transport tube trailer, capable of holding 14,000 pounds of ethylene.  The ethylene is connected directly from the transport trailer to the manufacturing operation through a piping manifol"
