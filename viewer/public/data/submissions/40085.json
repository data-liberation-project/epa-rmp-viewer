We measure our success by our record of improvement in safety performance, reductions in waste and emissions, and involvement with the community.\n\nCOMPANY HISTORY\n\nIn 1935, a company named Chemical Specialties, Inc. was formed to manufacture the bulk active sedative Carbromal for the US market.  This company operated at the Centennial Avenue location where Zeeland Chemicals, Inc. has now operated.  Chemical Specialties, Inc., a privately held company, owned and operated the plant from 1935 to 1947.  Miles Laboratories, Inc. owned and operated a unit at the same location from 1947 to 1977.  Hexcel Corporation owned and operated a division at the same location from 1977 to 1992.  Cambrex Corporation owned and operated a division (Zeeland Chemicals, Inc.) at the same location from 1992 to 2003.\n\nZeeland Chemicals, a division of Rutherford Chemicals, LLC, has owned and operated the manufacturing plant since 2003 and provides the pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries with the highest quality active ingredients, intermediates, chiral synthons, resolving agents, and services. Our facility is registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and we maintain systems for full compliance with the US FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) guidelines.  Today, Zeeland Chemicals sells approximately half of its products to customers for use as active ingredients or as intermediates and auxiliaries that ar"

The program covers industrial facilities having more than a threshold quantity of certain specified hazardous or flammable chemicals.\n\nThe program focuses on chemical release prevention, detection, and accident response, and requires each facility to develop and implement a site-specific risk management plan including a hazards assessment, an accident prevention program and an emergency response plan.  The program requires facilities to review worst case release scenarios no matter how unlikely those scenarios may be, and identify ways to minimize impacts from such releases.\n\nThe Zeeland Chemicals facility currently has two processes covered under this program.  The covered processes are as follows:\n\u00bf\tOn-site storage and usage of methyl chloride, which is a primary raw material in the manufacture of certain chlorinated quaternary ammonium compounds.\n\u00bf\tOn-site storage and usage of ethylene, a primary raw material in the manufacture of a co-polymer product which has final application in photographic film.\n\nZeeland Chemicals is committed to minimizing the risk of adverse impacts from its operations, and our commitment to responsible operations is built directly into our business objectives.  This commitment is manifested further in our use of sound operating and maintenance practices, use of safety-conscious designs as well as extensive employee training.  In addition, the performance of periodic safety audits and incident investigations are designed to review and minimize risks to employees, the environment, and the community.\n\nZeeland Chemicals continually strives to be an industry leader in environmental stewardship.

All Responsible Care signatories agree to enact seven codes of management practice.  Zeeland Chemicals is proud of its record of accomplishment in this regard by having implemented all seven codes.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nZeeland Chemicals has worked hard to ensure that our products and manufacturing operations meet or exceed industry standards of excellence for protecting both the community and the environment.  As a socially responsible company, we have set aggressive goals to continue improving our EH&S performance into the next decade.  It is through these efforts that our initiatives have helped us protect and enhance health and safety -- for our employees, neighbors and the public.  As a result, we are proud of our record of accomplishment in not having had an accidental off-site release of any of the 112(r) regulated substances within the last ten (10) years.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAs stated previously, the Zeeland Chemicals facility has two processes covered under the 112(r) program.  The first process utilizes ethylene as a raw material in the production of a copolymer and the second process utilizes methyl chloride that is used as primary raw material in the manufacture of chlorinated quaternary ammonium compounds.\n\nEthylene is being used in the manufacture of an ethylene/maleic anhydride (EMA) co-polymer product that is used in the glass fiber industry.  The ethylene is stored under pressure in one (1) transport tube trailer, capable of holding 14,000 pounds of ethylene.  The ethylene is connected directly from the transport trailer to the manufacturing operation through a piping manifol"

The methyl chloride is stored in a bulk storage tank with a maximum capacity of 41,540 pounds.  The methyl chloride is directly connected to the production operations through a piping manifold.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nFor the last several years, Zeeland Chemicals has embraced the use of Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and \u00bfWhat-If\u00bf analyses in support of our periodic safety reviews of our chemical processing operations.  As part of our compliance effort with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and Michigan\u00bfs Department of Labor (R325.18302) regulations, we have completed detailed reviews of our critical plant operations in order to assess their inherent safety readiness.  Similar to 112(r), these programs are specifically aimed at minimizing and/or eliminating the consequences of catastrophic releases.  This is done by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, employee training, and emergency response.\n\nKey to the success of these programs is the active involvement and participation of our employees in the completion of the process hazard analyses.  Our commitment to the use of the latest process hazard analysis techniques, detailed and accurate procedures and regular employee training, ensures that each critical safety component of our chemical processing operations is reviewed in detail.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nZeeland Chemicals is committed to conducting operations at the Zeeland facility in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.

If such an event occurs, these programs are designed to effectively respond to the incident and minimize potential impacts.\n\nZeeland Chemicals\u00bf emergency preparedness program consists of an integrated emergency response plan and procedures.  The plan has been designed for use by managers and emergency responders to assure that timely and proper emergency planning is carried out and to document that the necessary resources are available in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe associated emergency response procedures have been developed to assist plant employees and managers in responding to an emergency to protect employees, the general public, and the environment.

We will continue to assess the environmental impact of each of our processes and propose to design, build, operate and maintain all of our operations so they remain safe and acceptable to local communities and are protective of the environment.\n\nWe will be prepared for emergencies and will provide leadership to assist our local first responders to assist with their emergency preparedness.  We will promote open discussion with our neighbors about the products that we make, use and transport as well as the impacts of our activities on their safety, health and the environment.
