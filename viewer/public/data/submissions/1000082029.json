      "SummaryText": "Suiza Dairy Grou, LLC is proud to inform all interested parties that our company is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68. In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and facility safety.\r\n\r\nSuiza Dairy Group, LLC is located at 400 S. Chambers Drive, Decatur Indiana 46733. The facility produces ice cream and related ice cream novelties. Facility 1 and Facility 2 operate independent anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety performance; and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require. Major equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers, accumulators, purgers, and heat exchangers.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\n\r\nFacility 1 and Facility 2 refrigeration systems required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. Facility 1 refrigeration system contains approximately 27,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Facility 2 refrigeration system contains approximately 36,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\r\n\r\nThe site is approximately"
