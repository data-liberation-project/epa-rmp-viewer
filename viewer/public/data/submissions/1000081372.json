Our company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical production facilities everywhere we do business.  Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  It is the stated policy of SI Group to safely manage our site operations. The policy is signed by top management. In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur.  The facility is a certified Responsible Care facility.  Responsible Care is a technical standard for management of Environmental, Health, Safety and Security risks associated with our operations.  We believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.  If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plans, please contact our Environmental Health, Safety and Security Manager at (304) 284-2380 or Environmental Engineer at 304-284-2214. \n\n\n\nWe are committed to comply with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain a safe operation.  Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.  However, if a major release does occur, our trained on-site emergency response team will be activated.  \n\n\n\n2.0  Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nSI Group currently operates at plant in the Morgantown Industrial Park in Morgantow"

SI Group manufactures antioxidant chemicals marketed under trade names such as ULTRANOX(R), WESTON(R), and others.  Our products are additives used in various plastics, inks, coatings, and adhesives for improved ultraviolet (UV) heat, color, and processing stability. In order to provide top quality products for our customers, the South Plant facility utilizes a certain raw material in its manufacturing processes that is classified as toxic inhalation hazard.  \n\n\n\n\n\n3.0  General Accidental Release Prevention/Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nSI Group has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM is an integral part of working safety.  PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP.\n\n\n\nSome of the many, specific safety features to prevent chemical accidents include:\n\n-Computer controlled safety systems on the storage and transfer systems to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected;\n\n-Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n\n-Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks and tank truck unloading areas to contain a spill;\n\n-Building enclosures around tank truck unloading and storage equipment to contain a leak;\n\n-Both the unloading and storage building enclosures are equipped with a water deluge system that can be readily connected to a water supply to mitigate the release of vapors from the building;\n\n-The chemical is transferred through a double-walled or \"pipe-within-a-"

There were no reportable incidents at the South Plant over the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, the public, and the environment in the event of a major accidental release.  The Emergency Response Team (ERT) is trained in the proper response to an incidents including HazMat Technician Training, Confined Space Training, Emergency Medical Res ponders, and Incident Command System. We also invest in the equipment needed to respond to on-site emergencies.  The EHS Department personnel are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Ongoing training exercises with the ERT and External Response Agencies are important to the company's emergency response organization and help better prepare our partners in the community for emergency response necessary in the unlikely event of a major industrial incident.\n\n\n\nInformation about how to shelter yourself and your family in the event of a chemical emergency can be found in the local telephone directory and on the Monongalia County Office of Emergency Management's web page at http://www.moncooem.org/. \n\n\n\nAs consistent with the Monongalia County Emergency Response Plan, SI Group will work through the Monongalia County Emergency Management Commission to communicate any appropriate actions to be taken by the public in the event of a chemical emergency.\n\n\n\n6.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSI Group is committed to continuously improving the overall safety and environmental performance record at the Morgantown site.
