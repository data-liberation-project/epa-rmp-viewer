The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nAmmonium Polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer is produced by blending anhydrous ammonia with super-phosphoric acid in a reacting chamber and then mixing with water.  The process equipment consists of: (1) a 10,600-gallon commercial transport pressure vessel that is owned and operated by a an anhydrous ammonia transport company; and (2) a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  The MPR ancillary equipment includes transfer hoses, liquid pumps, process piping, reacting chamber, valves, pumps, evaporative cooling tower, flow meters, and pressure and temperature gauges.  The MPR does not have any storage capabilities for anhydrous ammonia. The APP product is not subject to the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThis covered process is subject to the OSHA PSM regulations and the IFRC is responsible for the development and implementation of its PSM.  Contractor Process Operators operate the covered process which includes the: (1) transportation and set up of an anhydrous ammonia  commercial transport pressure vessel; (2) transfer of anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid, and water to the MPR; (3) monitoring of flows, temperatures, and pressures; and (4) transfer of APP to storage.  The IFRC is responsible for training its Operators in accordance with the IFRC PSM.  The Facility requires that the IFRC have in place and demonstrates compliance with its OSHA PSM for the MPR operations.\n\n",

Although the process is not subject to the OSHA PSM rules, the Facility has incorporated this process into its PSM/RMPr combined management plan.  The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nThe MAP/DAP ingredient for O-Phos is produced by blending aqua ammonia with super-phosphoric acid in a stationary pipe reactor and then mixing with water.  The process equipment consists of: (1) the 20,300-gallon AST; and (2) a Stationary Pipe Reactor (SPR).  The SPR ancillary equipment includes transfer hoses, liquid pumps, process piping, reacting chamber, valves, pumps, evaporative cooling tower, flow meters, and pressure and temperature gauges.  The SPR does not have any storage capabilities for aqua ammonia. The MAP/DAP ingredient is not subject to the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nTrained Process Operators operate the covered process which includes the: (1) transfer of aqua ammonia, phosphoric acid, and water to the SPR; (2) monitoring of flows, temperatures, and pressures; and (3) transfer of the MAP/DAP to a mix pot where additional ingredients are added to make O-Phos.  These operations are conducted in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Operating Procedures.  Trained personnel perform maintenance on this covered process in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Mechanical Integrity Procedures.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis EPA RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r), OSHA 29 CFR ? 1910.119, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68. The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC (Helena) is submitting the EPA RMP as a 5-year update.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  Two chemicals (i.e. anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration) are stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\n?    Covered Process 1: NH3 Storage and Handling\n\n?    Covered Process 2: Base Blending\n\n?    Covered Process 3: Ammonium Polyphosphate (APP) Blending\n\n?    Covered Process 4: Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling\n\n?    Covered Process 5: O-Phos Blending\n\n \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for all five (5) covered processes.  The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  For the anhydrous ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 1, 2, and 3), the worst case release was modeled as if a 30,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.  For the aqua ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 4 and 5), the worst case release scenario assumes that the 20,300-gallon aqua amm"

      "SummaryText": "onia AST failed and instantaneously spills the content into secondary containment that has a total containment capacity of 17,625 gallons when considering displacement of the other ASTs within the containment.  Therefore, some of the aqueous ammonia spills over the containment and collects onto the ground.  For purposes of determining the impacted surface area adjacent to the containment, it was assumed that the aqueous ammonia covers the impacted areas to a depth of 1 cm.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia due to (1) rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation associated with Covered Process 1; (2) rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose during transfer and blending at Covered Process 3; and (3) a leaking 2-inch process pipe during transfer and blending at Covered Process 2. The alternative scenario for Covered Process 4 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to the rupture of a transfer hose during a transfer operation and the alternative release scenario for Covered Process 5 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to break in the process piping between the liquid pump and Blender that occurs during a blending operation. Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Fertilizer Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 and 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.
