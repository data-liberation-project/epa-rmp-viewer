They are transported on roads, water, and railways. We at Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District (FSSD) and our Contract Operator (the primary contractor responsible for all plant maintenance and operations in the facility) use chemicals, too. For example, we use chlorine and sulfur dioxide to disinfect our water to provide safe water discharges to the environment or for landscaping or irrigation uses. Storing large qualities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine and sulfur dioxide very seriously. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency. Please feel free to contact Gerald McMackin at (707) 429-3233 or Larry Bahr at (707) 429-8930 if you have any questions.\nFSSD and the Contract Operator's basic commitment to responsible stewardship of the environment, protection of the community, protection of employee health, and assurance of product safety extends to the processes covered by the new EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements. We have developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment. This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\nWe plan to meet or exceed regulatory requirements. In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents. Chlorine"

The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the disinfection of wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment. To meet this requirement, we store chlorine in quantities up to 23 one-ton cylinders. Typically, three chlorine cylinders are connected to a common manifold and liquid is piped from the two cylinders through a chlorine gas evaporator, to the chlorinators and on to chlorine injectors where it is injected into plant process water.\nWe store sulfur dioxide in quantities up to 12 one-ton cylinders. Typically, two sulfur dioxide cylinders are manifolded and liquid is piped from the two cylinders through a sulfur dioxide gas evaporator, to the sulfunators and on to the injectors where sulfur dioxide is injected into plant process water.\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe developed worst-case and alternative case release scenarios for chlorine to determine the effects an accidental chemical release would have on the public. The development of the worst-case scenario is directed by EPA regulation. Namely, the quantity of a substance released is equal to the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipeline. The alternative case release scenario developed is considered to be a more likely release scenario. However, the alternative case release scenario is still considered unlikely to occur. As part of its release prevention program, discussed in detail in the next section, FSSD and the Contract Operator are constantly mo"

In addition to these administrative controls, FSSD and the Contract Operator have the systems enclosed in a building and have automatic release mitigation systems, including a scrubber system in place.\nFor worst-case and alternative case release scenarios, the USEPA's RMP*Comp model was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.\nWorst-Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe largest vessel of chlorine on-site contains 2,000 pounds. If the entire contents of this tank were released over 10 minutes, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 2.2 miles. \nThe largest vessel of sulfur dioxide on-site contains 2,000 pounds. If the entire contents of this tank were released over 10 minutes, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 2.1 miles.\nAlternative Case Scenario\nFor chlorine, a release scenario considered by FSSD and the Contract Operator to be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario would be a pressure regulator failure and leak to the atmosphere. Under this scenario, 2.37 pounds per minute of gaseous chlorine would be released for 60 minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario was calculated at 0.1 miles. \nFor sulfur dioxide, a release scenario considered by FSSD and the Contract Operator to be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario would assume liquid is released from a 5/16-inch pigtail. Under this scenario, 7.95 pounds per minute of gaseous sulfur dioxide would be released over 60 minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario was calculated at 0.2 miles. \n4.
