Nevertheless, Mission Bell Winery continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Mission Bell Winery's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Mission Bell Winery's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nMission Bell Winery has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Mission Bell Winery has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Mission Bell Winery now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Mission Bell Winery employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Mission Bell Winery will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

The liquid transfer vessels receive liquid from the main suction accumulators. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessels reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessels to become subject to high pressure and activating the transfer pumps which moves the liquid to the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessels and transfer pumps can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the chillers to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulators or chillers and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condensers\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the chillers to the atmosphere.

      "SummaryText": "ers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nSafety Systems\r\n\r\nEmergency Control Box\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Control Box (ECB) is installed in the Black Grape system on the south side of the machinery area. The ECB contains three (3) valves:\r\n\r\nValve A: High Side Discharge Valve\r\n\r\nValve B: Low Side Discharge Valve\r\n\r\nValve C: Diffusion Tank Isolation Valve\r\n\r\nIf necessary, these valves can be used to achieve the following results:\r\n\r\nValves A and C are used to relieve the pressure of the high side of the system to the diffusion tank. \r\n\r\nValves B and C are used to relieve the pressure of the low side of the system to the diffusion tank.\r\n\r\nValves A and B are used to equalize the pressure from the high pressure receiver to the low pressure chillers.\r\n\r\nRelief Valves\r\n\r\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing. Details regarding the relief valves are summarized below:\r\n\r\nAll relief valves are connected to a common manifold which terminates into an ammonia diffusion tank; \r\n\r\nMany relief valves are equipped with a rupture disc and non-resetting gauge to assist in recognizing that an overpressure event has occurred. The rupture discs are installed upstream of each relief valve and are designed to break at the relief valve set pressure. Once the rupture disc gauge has been broken, the gauge needle will move to the burst zone, indicating that the relief valve has lifted. The gauges can be manually reset;"

      "SummaryText": "Diffusion Tank\r\n\r\nEach refrigeration system is equipped with an ammonia diffusion tank which mitigates most of the hazards associated with a relief valve lifting. The relief valve discharge piping is terminated at the bottom of each ammonia diffusion tank. The ammonia diffusion tank specifications are listed in the Safety Systems document. Under normal conditions, the ammonia diffusion tanks contain water.\r\n\r\nScrew Compressor Safety Devices\r\n\r\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment. The following list summarizes the safety devices built into each screw compressor package:\r\n\r\nHigh Discharge Pressure Cutout - The high discharge pressure cutout, will shut down the compressor if the discharge pressure equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\n\r\nLow Suction Pressure Cutout - The low suction pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the suction pressure is equal to or less than the setpoint.\r\n\r\nOil Pressure Cutout - The oil pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil pressure equals or deviates below the setpoint.\r\n\r\nHigh Oil Temperature Cutout - The high oil temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil temperature equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\n\r\nLow Oil Temperature Cutout - The low oil temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil temperature equals or falls below the setpoint.\r\n\r\nDischarge Temperature Cutout - The high discharge temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the discharge temperature equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\n\r\nReciprocating Compressor Safety Devices\r\n\r\nEach reciprocating compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment.

This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.\r\n\r\nMain Liquid Feed Shut-Off Valve (King Valve)\r\n\r\nThe high pressure receivers are each equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the systems. \r\n\r\nEmergency Refrigeration Switch (E-Stop)\r\n\r\nSelect machinery areas are equipped with an emergency refrigeration switch (e-stop) that controls power to the refrigeration machinery. The switches can be activated in an emergency using the hammer next to each switch to break the switch glass, or by pressing a push button.\r\n\r\n1.2.3.2 Ion Exchange & Vacuum Pan Neutralization \r\nThe ammonia storage tank located on the north side of the property supplies liquid ammonia to the Ion Exchange Area through piping installed both underground, and overhead. Control valve groups are located near the ammonia storage tank, and near the neutralizing tanks.
