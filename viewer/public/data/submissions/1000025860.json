Five processes in the CRNF Plant contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases. It is this facility's policy to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substance, in particular hazardous and regulated substances, as well as strive to eliminate, to the extent possible, even minor and inconsequential releases of any type. Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of this plant, to the safety of its employees, and to the safety of the general public.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\r\n-- A knowledgeable, highly trained, and motivated employee group\r\n-- A well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\r\n-- Improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention where appropriate\r\n-- A superior safety and accident record as the result of an excellent safety program\r\n-- Preparation and training for emergency response and mitigation\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Selexol unit, ammonia synthesis unit, urea unit, refrigerated atmospheric ammonia storage tank, and pressurized ammonia bullet tanks constitute the processes covered by the USEPA RMP rule. Regulated substances in covered processes above the threshold quantity include anhydrous ammonia and a flammable gas mixture. \r\n\r\nThe CRNF Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex producing anhydrous ammonia and UAN solutions for use as agricultural fertilizers.

The facility consists of an air separation unit, a gasification unit, a Selexol unit, a hydrogen purification unit, an ammonia synthesis unit, a urea unit, a nitric acid unit, an ammonium nitrate-UAN unit, and storage and loading units for ammonia and UAN. \r\n\r\nThe gasification unit produces hydrogen gas and carbon oxides by the partial oxidation of petroleum coke with oxygen in the presence of water. The hydrogen is purified by shift conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, the removal of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide in the Selexol unit, and removal of trace contaminants using pressure swing adsorption in the hydrogen purification unit.\r\n\r\nIn the ammonia synthesis unit the hydrogen reacts with nitrogen to make anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia along with by-product carbon dioxide is used to produce liquid urea in the urea unit. In the nitric acid unit, ammonia and air are also used to produce a weak nitric acid solution that is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate. The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product in the UAN unit. On-site storage tanks have been constructed to safely hold the ammonia and UAN products based on seasonal demand requirements.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nCovered processes at the CRNF Plant are subject to the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule codified in Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1910 Subpart H (29 CFR 1910.119), because these covered processes contain more than the threshold quantity of a highly hazardous chemical. The covered processes at the CRNF Plant adhere to the requirements of PSM and have written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and applicable USEPA RMP Prevention Programs.

Employees participate in process reviews, assist with development of procedures, and all other aspects of the program.\r\n-- Process Safety Information (PSI) - All necessary process information and records are accessible to employees including information on the hazards of the chemicals, process technology with safe operating limits, and equipment records and design requirements.\r\n-- Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Process hazard analysis and review has been conducted by employee teams to identify and correct any perceived hazards. These reviews are updated every five years or more often if changes indicate the necessity of additional review.\r\n-- Operating Procedures - Operating procedures are prepared for all aspects of operation including emergency operation and shutdown, operating limits and methods to correct or avoid deviations from specified limits, safety and health considerations for process operations and the chemicals involved, and safety system operation and function.\r\n-- Training - All operators receive initial training in the process and its operating procedures and continue to receive refresher training at least every three years. In reality, operator training is a continual and ongoing process. Operator training includes on-the-job training (OJT) with experienced operators and also classroom-type instruction.\r\n-- Contractors - Contractor selection includes review of the Contractor's safety performance and programs.

Additional pre-startup safety reviews are made for any significant modification to a covered process that requires a change in PSI prior to startup to ensure that construction and equipment is installed in accordance with design; all necessary procedures including safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; training is completed; and that hazard analysis and requirements of management of change are completed.\r\n-- Mechanical Integrity (MI) - Procedures for inspection, testing and correction of equipment deficiencies have been prepared. A quality assurance procedure assures equipment, parts, materials, and installations are suitable for the applications intended. Maintenance employees are trained in the process hazards and in safety procedures applicable to their work.\r\n-- Hot Work Permit - Procedures and policies for hot work permits and maintenance and operating actions are in place for accident prevention.\r\n-- Management of Change (MOC) - No changes are allowed to the process or procedures without review and authorization. Safety impacts, technical basis, required procedure modification, and training are all considered in the review. The MOC process is used to verify the safety of the change and to prevent unintended consequences as a result of change.\r\n-- Incident Investigation - Any incident which results in a significant chemical release, or could have reasonably resulted in such a release, is promptly investigated by a facility team. Findings of the investigation and recommendations for corrective action are documented as are the resolution of the recommendations and corrective actions.\r\n-- Compliance Audit - An audit is conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance. Findings of the audit, if any, are documented and any deficiencies are corrected and documented. The audit is conducted by persons knowledgeable of the facility processes.  The two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChem"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a releases occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant processes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the CRNF Plant interfaces with plans developed by other local emergency response organizations.  This coordination includes periodic meetings that include local emergency response officials, local government officials, industry representatives and the local media.  The CRNF Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, police, media).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) meetings, the CRNF Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.
