Facility Information\n\n  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous\n\n  ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop\n\n  production nutrients. The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 130,000 lbs. in our 30,000 gal.\n\n  storage tank and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a truck tank\n\n  holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n  3.  \"Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and\n\n        alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security\n\n        sensitive information as requested by EPA.\"\n\n\n\n  4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\n\n  Anhydrous Ammonia, K-6.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute Inc. and the\n\n  Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\n\n  \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
