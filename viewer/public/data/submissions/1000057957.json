(WPX) at the Emma Owner Pad.  This report provides the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the recovery skid system, pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. EPA RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe system is designed to remove liquids from gas at the wellhead.  The refrigeration system can operate at subzero temperatures.  BFX Energy Solutions uses this system to remove liquids from produced gas prior to flaring. \n\n\n\nThree LPG portable storage tanks will be used for liquid products storage. Each has a maximum capacity of 18,000 gallons. BFX Energy Solutions limits the maximum fill to 80% of the tank volume or 14,400 gallons each. \n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this assessment, the LPG storage tanks will be filled to 14,400 gallons, which is equivalent 82,224 lbs. of flammable liquids. The worst case scenario would be is both tanks exploded and the total pounds of flammable liquids used for the analysis is 246,672 lbs. \n\n\n\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004. This facility is regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMP plans must be prepared for processes that store in excess of the thresholds set forth by 40 CFR 68.130. For flam"

BFX Energy Solutions can store approximately 246,672 lbs of LPG and exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold, thus the facility is subject to the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule and must prepare a RMP.\n\n\n\nLOCATION\n\n\n\nAddress:  9637 25th Street NW\n\nMandaree, ND 58757\n\nNE ? of Section 26, T150N, R94W, McKenzie County, North Dakota\n\nLatitude: 47.785886, Longitude: -102.671036\n\nDriving Directions: Proceed westerly from Mandaree, North Dakota along 22nd Street Northwest. Follow this route for approximately 1.2 miles to the intersection of Highway 22. Turn right onto Highway 22 and continue northerly for approximately 2.8 miles to the intersection of BIA 28. Turn right onto BIA 28 and continue easterly for approximately 3.4 miles to the access road to the Emma Owner 23-14H pad site.

The survey showed that no population is within the 0.5 mile impact radius for the worst case release. The impact area on a map is demonstrated in appendix A. The types of public receptors and environmental receptors identified within the impact area are listed in Table 2-2.  Google Earth was used to find the public receptors within the impact radius.  The distance to the nearest public receptor from the facility is approximately 1.5 miles, which is beyond the 0.5 mile distance to the level of concern. Additionally, no environmental receptors are impacted by the worst-case release scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
