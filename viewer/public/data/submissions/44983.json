The transfer subsystem consists of 7 \r\ntransfer pumps and piping used to transfer propellant from the storage tanks to \r\nthe gashouses producing the aerosol cans.  The charging subsystem consists of 4 \r\ngassers in 2 gashouses along with the associated charge pumps, hydro pumps, \r\nvacuum pumps and piping.  The gassers charge and seal the propellant into the \r\naerosol cans.\r\n\r\nThe propellant filling system is protected by specific safety systems and \r\nhardware which include safety relief valves, excess flow valves, and safety \r\ninterlocks and alarms.  Safety relief valves protect the storage tanks and the \r\npiping to the gassers.  Excess flow valves are located at all inlet and outlet \r\nconnections to the storage tanks.  The excess flow valves would close if a \r\nlarger-than-normal flow of propellant from the vessel were to occur.  Gas \r\ndetectors and alarms within the gashouses monitor the ambient air to ensure \r\nproper operation of the system.  Abnormally high concentrations of propellant \r\nwithin a gashouse will actuate special exhaust equipment and, if levels continue \r\nto rise, shut down the process.\r\n\r\nPropellant filling is accomplished in a closed system.  Historical releases of \r\npropellant have included only small volumes infrequently released from \r\nthe gassers inside the gashouses.

To help minimize the probability and severity of a propellant \r\nrelease, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health \r\nAdministration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous \r\nChemicals standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented at the Rossville, \r\nIllinois, facility.  The major objective of this prevention program is to \r\nimplement a management system that prevents releases of propellant, especially \r\nin situations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards.  The \r\nprogram employs a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process including \r\nprocess design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance \r\nactivities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency \r\npreparedness and procedures, training programs, and other interrelated elements \r\nthat effect the propellant system.\r\n\r\nThe key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n  Process safety information regarding the propellant system has been \r\ndeveloped, documented, and made available to facility operators.

The PHA resulted in multiple procedural and/or \r\nhardware recommendations to improve the safety and operation of the propellant \r\nsystem.  The PHA will be updated and revalidated every 5 years.\r\n\r\n    Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the \r\nbasis for proper and safe operation of the propellant system.  The \r\nSOPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, \r\nemergency operation, and emergency shutdown.\r\n\r\n    Formal authorization systems are in place to ensure that system \r\nchanges or expansions are as safe as the original design, and that an \r\nindependent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the \r\nengineering design and can be safely operated prior to startup.\r\n\r\n    Operators and mechanics working in the propellant fill building or \r\nwho are responsible for unloading propellant from tank cars receive \r\ntraining on the process hazards, process safety information, SOPs and \r\nemergency response actions related to the propellant system.  The \r\ntraining program ensures that the operators understand the nature \r\nand causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to \r\nincrease awareness of the hazards particular to the propellant system.\r\n\r\n    A mechanical integrity program has been implemented and includes:  \r\n(1) routine system inspections to identify unusual or increasing \r\nvibration, incipient leaks, or other indications of potential upsets or \r\nfailures; (2) replacement or testing of pressure relief valves on the \r\nstorage tank every 10 years; and (3) periodic testing of gauges, \r\nmonitoring devices, and safety interlocks.\r\n\r\n    Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame \r\nproducing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), the \r\nwork must be approved by executing a written hot work permit to \r\nverify precautions have been implemented"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n \r\nWe at ConAgra Store Brands are strongly committed to employee, public and \r\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive \r\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, \r\ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training \r\nassociated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement \r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.0    SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\n1.1    SOURCE\r\n\r\nThe ConAgra Store Brands (ConAgra) facility located in Rossville, \r\nIllinois, is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agencys \r\n(USEPAs) Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release \r\nregulation (40 CFR 68) because it has two independent processes that \r\ncontain mixtures of propane (Chemical Abstract System [CAS] number 74-\r\n98-6) and isobutane (CAS number 75-28-5) exceeding 10,000 pounds.  The \r\nmixtures are used as propellant for aerosol cooking oil cans.  The two processes \r\nare: (1) propellant injection into aerosol cans (the propellant process), and \r\n(2) finished goods warehousing.\r\n\r\nPropellant is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure and is stored in \r\nseven storage tanks at varying pressures.  Administrative controls in place at \r\nthe facility, including written loading procedures, limit the tank fill volume \r\nto 80 percent of capacity.  The storage tanks and transfer pumps and piping are \r\nlocated outdoors.\r\n\r\nFinished goods are transferred to the on-site warehouse for storage and \r\ndistribution.  Mixtures of propellant and food-grade oil are stored in 8- to 16-\r\nounce (net weight) cans.\r\n \r\nPropellant is a flammable and potentially explosive gas.  The propellant is \r\nnot inherently toxic.\r\n\r\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe ConAgra propellant filling system is comprised of three subsystems: storage, \r\ntransfer and charging.  The storage subsystem consists of 7 above ground storage \r\nta"
