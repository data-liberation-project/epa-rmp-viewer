      "SummaryText": "Vandenberg Air Force Base (AFB) is the third largest Air Force installation in the nation encompassing over 99,100 acres in Santa Barbara County, California.  Its unique geography provides America with its primary means to launch polar orbiting satellites without over flying populated areas.  This mission?which is crucial to national security as well as the burgeoning interest in communications, land resources surveillance, and space research?is dependent on the continued launching of an array of space boosters.  Additionally, the Air Force conducts operational testing of Minuteman and Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at Vandenberg AFB; these ICBMs are launched into broad ocean area targets or toward instrumented target sites on the Marshall Islands.  Vandenberg AFB also manages the Western Range?a vast network of radar, telemetry, and optical sensors stretching across the Pacific Ocean?in which all three services conduct a variety of aeronautical and missile flight activities.\nWhile Vandenberg AFB comprises some 2,000 buildings and 2,000 residences for military personnel, only 15 percent of its total area is developed.  The remainder provides the buffer needed to preclude encroachment by local development and to protect outlying communities from launch anomalies and associated operational hazards.  Restrictive easements affecting development on adjacent private land further limit potential risk to the public.  Significantly, over the last 45 years, more than 1,800 launches of space boosters and ICBMs have been conducted at Vandenberg AFB, and there is no known instance of serious injury or death to anyone in the surrounding communities as a result of a chemical release due to the launches themselves or to supporting operations.\nWith this submittal, Vandenberg AFB is making a conscientious effort to fully comply with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, as implemented by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (40"

The format developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for this submittal is generally oriented toward accommodating commercial or government operated stationary sources that differ significantly from Vandenberg AFB in terms of physical size, complexity, emergency response capability, and organizational make-up.  Accordingly, additional detail and clarification are incorporated in this Executive Summary to provide the public clearer, more complete insight into the scope and effectiveness of Vandenberg AFB's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nScope of the Vandenberg AFB Risk Management Plan\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) includes all covered process within the borders of Vandenberg AFB that are subject to Department of the Air Force oversight and control.  Under the Commercial Space Act, excess facilities on the base may be leased by private entities to conduct commercial activities that are not under the purview of the Department of the Air Force.  Compliance with EPA RMP and CalARP requirements for covered processes that solely support such commercial activities is the responsibility of the respective commercial owner and operator; such covered processes are not included in this RMP.\nThis RMP includes three processes in which the EPA threshold of a regulated toxic or flammable substance is exceeded.  Two of these processes?the Hypergolic Storage Facility and Space Launch Complex No. 4 East (SLC-4E)?involve the regulated toxic liquids 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and Hydrazine, collectively referred to as hypergolic propellants.  The third process at SLC-3E involves liquid Hydrogen, a flammable substance.  \nEmergency Response Program\nVandenberg AFB possesses significant emergency response capabilities that include its own Fire Department, Disaster Control Group, and "

In coordination with the Environmental Management Flight, 30 CES/CEV, the Readiness Flight also develops and updates Vandenberg?s 30 SW Plan 32-4002-A, ?Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan.?  Additionally, the Readiness Flight chairs the Hazardous Materials Planning Team, ensures that follow-on elements of the Disaster Control Group are assembled as required by the On-Scene Commander in the event of a release response, and maintains training certificates for spill response team members.\nThe Vandenberg AFB Fire Department, 30 CES/CEF, is the \"local agency\" that responds as First Responder at the Technician Level to an accidental release of hazardous materials on the base.  This Fire Department comprises over 100 firefighters who staff five fire stations strategically positioned across the base.  One fire station is located within a three-minute response time of both Program 3 processes described in this submittal.  This Fire Department is also seasonally augmented by a 20-person \"Hot-Shot\" crew that is specially trained to respond to wildland fires.\nThe Vandenberg AFB Fire Department is fully compliant with National Fire Protection Agency standards and has mutual aid agreements with Santa Barbara County, the City of Lompoc, the City of Santa Maria, the California Forestry Department, and the Los Padres National Forest.

It should be noted that the Vandenberg AFB Fire Department is advised of all operations involving the transfer of hypergolic propellants, which comprise the regulated substances in the Program 3 processes on the base.  During launch operations, Fire Department response elements are pre-positioned to expedite response in the event of an anomaly.\nVandenberg AFB also contracts for a Hypergolic Emergency Response Team (HERT) that can respond within 60 minutes of notification with scapesuit-qualified technicians; this emergency response team is capable of handling the hypergolic propellants described in this submittal.  It should be noted that scapesuit-qualified technicians are pre-positioned on location for hypergolic propellant transfer operations.\nThe Vandenberg AFB Command Post is staffed 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and provides a central point of contact in the event of an emergency on the base.  Its extensive suite of communications equipment includes hotlines to both the Santa Barbara County Emergency Services and the Lompoc Fire Dispatch Control Center.\nThe Disaster Control Group (DCG) comprises experienced, senior personnel who represent a cross-section of technical, logistical, medical, and communications expertise.

Accordingly, Vandenberg AFB identifies Nitrogen Tetroxide as a highly toxic substance that is stored on the installation in quantities that could pose a risk to the general public.  Nitrogen Tetroxide is used primarily as the oxidizer component of the hypergolic propellants employed by various space boosters launched from Vandenberg AFB; it is also occasionally used in smaller quantities as a propellant for satellites launched from Vandenberg AFB and in the PSRE of certain ICBMs tested at the base.\nAll aspects of Vandenberg AFB's RMP and CalARP programs?to include OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards and emergency response program planning and training?encompass Nitrogen Tetroxide storage and operations to the same extent that they apply to the regulated hydrazines as described in this submittal.  It should be noted that a review of the base's five-year accident history reveals that there have been no reportable accidents involving base employees, contractors and/or anyone in the general public as a result of exposure to a release of Nitrogen Tetroxide.  Vandenberg AFB fully intends to maintain every aspect of its current accidental release prevention program as it applies to Nitrogen Tetroxide as long as substantive quantities of this substance are stored or used at the base."
