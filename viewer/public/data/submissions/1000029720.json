Prior to entering the evaporator coils, the ammonia expands and flashes to saturation temperature as the pressure is reduced through the respective expansion valves.  The resulting low-pressure liquid ammonia absorbs heat from the space as the liquid ammonia evaporates in the coils.\n\n\n\nThe HPR also provides high pressure liquid ammonia to the chiller plate and frame heat exchanger surge drums, the milk and crystallizing tanks surge drums, and the air dehumidifier in the Whey Building.  Liquid injection cooling (LIC) is also provided by the HPR for screw compressor oil cooling.\n\n\n\nHigh temperature saturated ammonia vapor (HTRS) is returned from the cold room evaporator coils and the brine and glycol chillers to the Recirculator Package vessel.  Medium temperature suction (MTS) returns saturated ammonia vapor from the air handling units, milk and crystallizing tanks, and the air dehumidifier to the Suction Accumulator (SA1), where the vapor is separated from the liquid.\n\n\n\nAs liquid ammonia accumulates in the Suction Accumulator, the liquid is transferred to the Recirculator Package (RP1) via the HTRS line and a pressure differential.  Ammonia vapor (MTS) is provided to the high temperature reciprocating compressors from the Suction Accumulator (SA1) and to the medium temperature screw compressors from the Recirculator Package (RP1).  If configured as a swing compressor, RC5 is provided suction vapor for compression from the Suction Accumulator or the Recirculator Package, depending on the operation configuration.  Currently, the system is configured and operated as a single stage system.\n\n\n\nExcess accumulation of liquid ammonia in the Recirculator Package (R"

Once the LTU liquid level rises to a setpoint, a level sensor opens the three-way solenoid valve, allowing hot gas from the high side discharge of the compressors to drain the liquid in the LTU to the High Pressure Receiver (HPR).   As the liquid level in the LTU drops, the three-way valve changes position and transfers ammonia vapor through the MTS line back to the Recirculator Package.\n\n\n\nHigh-pressure, high-temperature ammonia vapor discharge from the compressors provides hot gas defrost for the evaporator coils, brine chillers, and operation of the automatic liquid transfer system.  The heat of compression in the compressor discharge is removed in the Evaporative Condensers.  An equalizer line between the condenser discharge and the High Pressure Receiver ensures that equal pressure is maintained between the two points to ensure proper liquid draining.\n\n\n\nAn Autopurger periodically removes noncondensibles from the system.  The Ammonia Diffusion Tank is maintained full of water to absorb a system overpressure release from the vessel pressure relief valves.  Emergency E-stop switches are located at the perimeter of the Compressor Area for emergency shutdown.  Ammonia sensors in the Compressor Area, HPR Area, and production areas trigger audible/visual notifications.\n\n\n\nThe operation staff consists of the Maintenance Manager and Refrigeration Operator/Mechanics.
