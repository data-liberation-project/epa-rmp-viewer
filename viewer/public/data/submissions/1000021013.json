      "SummaryText": "The Northampton Wastewater Treatment Plant at 33 Hockanum Rd. in Northampton, MA is a publicly owned facility. Gaseous chlorine is used to disinfect wastewater prior to discharge. The Northampton WWTP stores more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine at its Northampton facility. Therefore, the plant is required to address the requirements of 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe Northampton Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) currently stores up to 16,000 pounds of chlorine in eight, one-ton containers.  The chlorine is stored in a dedicated building located at the waste water treatment plant site.  The goal of 40 CFR 68 is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) require EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. Part 68 is that rule. \nThe phrase \"Risk Management Program\" refers to all of the requirements of Part 68, which must be implemented on an on-going basis. The phrase \"Risk Management Plan (RMP)\" refers to this document as well as the registration information submitted to EPA.\n\nThe Plan contains the Policies and Procedures used at the Northampton WWTP to assure continued compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program.  All employees are strongly encouraged to review these Policies and Procedures.  The manual is available for review by any employee at any time.  Any recommendation to improve a document's accuracy or effectiveness in assuring employee, visitor and contractor safety can be directed to management.\n\nThe implementation and management responsibilities for the Plan have to be clearly defined.  The Management Systems section discusses various duties that must be addressed in order to fulfill the intent of the Pl"

This section also describes the employee responsibilities associated with each duty.\n\nA major component of the Plan is the assessment of impact associated with the accidental release of the hazardous material(s) in question.  The relevant plan section evaluates both the worst-case release as well as alternative releases that are specific to the site.\nOur analysis focuses on the impact to neighboring areas called receptors. \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is a repository for information related to the safety of a process.  Three major subjects addressed in this Section are: \nA?    The hazards of the chemicals and the process (physical properties, toxicity and exposure limits, fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability, corrosivity data).\nA?    The process technology (process chemistry, process flow diagrams, safe operating limits, maximum intended inventories, consequences of deviation).\nA?    Equipment information (piping and instrumentation diagrams, material and energy balances, safety systems involved, materials of construction, electrical classification, relief system design and design basis, ventilation system design and design basis, design codes and standards employed).  This information is used as a reference during Process Hazards Analyses.\nDocumentation is found primarily in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  The MSDS are filed alphabetically at the Northampton WWTP along with any evidence of employee participation in the development of PSI.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) is a systematic approach toward evaluating the safety of a process.  PHA's must address the hazards of a process, previous incidents having potential for serious consequences, engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors and an evaluation of the range of exposures if controls fail. Employees must have input into the prioritization of PHA's and this schedule must be fully communicated to all employees.  PHA's must fol"

These PHA files should include the pertinent process safety information.\nThe first PHA performed under the RMP program was conducted on November 17, 2000. The results of the PHA were reviewed by the RMPC prior to final approval and incorporation into this plan.  The PHA was subsequently updated in April 2008 by Tighe & Bond personnel, and again in the current document dated February 2011.  The 2011 revised PHA was completed by a team from Kleinfelder/S E A Consultants in collaboration with Northampton operations personnel.  For consistency, the checklist approach developed in the original PHA, and continued in the 2008 revision, has been employed in this PHA as well.\n\nOperating procedures are instructions that outline how to safely operate a process consistent with Process Safety Information.  They must be appropriate, clear, consistent and well communicated.  Procedures must address steps for each operating phase (initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operation, normal shutdown, startup after a turnaround), operating limits (consequences of deviation, steps to correct or avoid), and safety and health considerations (properties/hazards of chemicals, precautions to avoid exposure, control measures in the event contact occurs, quality control, inventory control, special or unique hazards, safety systems & their function).
