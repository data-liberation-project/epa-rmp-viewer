      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The facility policy for accidental release prevention:\n\n     This facility handles anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  Anhydrous \n     ammonia is a valuable tool used in production agriculture as cost effective fertilizer.  The management  \n     and  employees of SEK GRAIN, INC.  are committed to the safe handling and prevention of any\n     accidental  release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is\n     prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and\n     minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:\n\n     The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for retail sale to area farmers.\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for, direct application to area fields as fertilizer\n     The maximum stored quantity would be 51000 lbs. in our 12,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum\n     quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport tanker holding 40,000 lbs.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\n          released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 51,000 lbs., which\n          represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  \n     b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a break\n          in a transfer hose.\n     c.  The distance to the endpoint has been calculated using the RMP Comp model and is on file in the site \n          office.\n\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of  \n     Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published "

The facility has also complied with the Kansas\n     Department of Agriculture?s Anhydrous Ammonia Safety Program titled, ?Kansas Anhydrous Ammonia\n     regulations pertaining to handling, storage and transportation of anhydrous ammonia.?\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n\n     There has been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6.  The Emergency Action Program:\n\n     The Facility has:\n\n     a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38:\n\n     b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n          information as required under SARA Title II (EPCRA). \n\n     c.  A Written Emergency Action Program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120.\n          Including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n     d.  Discussed program with local fire department.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed by\n     employees and the Kansas Department of Agriculture to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. \n     There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this\n     time."
