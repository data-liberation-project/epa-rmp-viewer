While the design of the facility incorporates multiple safety devices, safe handling procedures, maintaining mechanical integrity, and appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to safety at our facility.\r\n\r\nPenske has implemented a process safety management (PSM) program that complies with the regulations stipulated by 29 CFR 1910.119, which requires Penske to implement integrated safeguards to prevent an ammonia release. A crucial component of this plan is the emergency action plan, developed in compliance with the emergency planning provisions of 29 CFR 1910.38. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties to enable coordinated action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\n2.2\tFacility Description and Substances Handled\r\nPenske is a cold storage facility that stores and distributes produce and other perishable products. Cold storage requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of foods, and Penske uses ammonia as the refrigerant. Access to the facility is limited to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\r\n\r\n2.3\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nPenske's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually, audited every three years, and updated as necessary by Penske"

Only qualified maintenance personnel operate the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n2.4\tFive-Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the Penske facility in the past five years. \r\n\r\n2.5\tEmergency Planning and Response\r\nPenske has a written emergency action plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It complies with the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.38. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been provided to and reviewed with Fort Worth Fire Department.\r\n\r\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Penske and to establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, Penske has trained personnel to immediately notify Forth Worth Fire Department and take defensive actions to mitigate the release. Automatic alarms, shutdown systems, and controls have been designed to minimize the potential for an uncontrolled release.\r\n\r\nAll Penske personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock emergency drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\r\n\r\nThis plan shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\r\n\r\n2.6\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will"

Higher priority items are scheduled for completion in 2019, including development of a policy to use spotters while operators use mobile equipment in the engine room and updating procedures for adding ammonia to the system. Lower priority items are scheduled for completion by 2020 including improvements to the standard operating procedures and estimating the necessary time and budget to implement maintenance tasks. Penske will track assigned target dates and the completion status of all PHA recommendations to ensure items are addressed promptly."
