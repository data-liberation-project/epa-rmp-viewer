The WGS stores and uses aqueous ammonia (29-percent aqueous ammonia solution) in a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to control nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Using and storing aqueous ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. WGS personnel take their safety obligations very seriously and ensure that operators involved in the use of aqueous ammonia are trained and knowledgeable in the chemical hazards associated with their jobs. The following Risk Management Plan (RMP) describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, some of the steps taken to ensure a safely operating power plant, and how chemical emergencies are handled. This RMP complies with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 2, Chapter 4.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe WGS accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. Applicable federal procedures and state of California procedures are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \n\n\n\nWGS facility management recognizes the responsibility to make the environment, community, and employee safety a primary part of daily concerns. The WGS is committed to being a responsible member within the community by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. The WGS is dedicated to developing an environmentally responsible energy resource compatible with community need"

The prevention of accidents and protection of its employees, property, and the general public are essential to the efficient and successful completion of every project undertaken by the WGS. The WGS requires active injury and illness prevention as an important element of production on a daily basis.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the WGS that every employee is entitled to a safe and healthful place in which to work and live. The WGS incorporates the concepts of environmental responsibility and productivity with safety resulting in efficiency and productivity. \n\n\n\nAs part of the WGS's obligation to protect the integrity of human, environmental, physical, and financial resources, and to conserve and efficiently utilize those resources, the WGS will:\n\n- Comply fully with laws regulating environmental protection and employee health and safety.\n\n- Furnish work places free of recognized hazards likely to cause injury to employees, the public, or the environment.\n\n- Train employees in safe and environmentally conscious practices and require compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations, policies, and procedures.\n\n- Provide a professional staff to maintain and support environmental, health, and safety programs.\n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\n\n\nThe WGS is a 185-megawatt (MW) electrical generation facility equipped with two gas turbine engine powered generators, referred to as WGS Units 1 and 2; six internal combustion reciprocating engine powered electrical generators, referred to as WGS Unit 3; and associated equipment. All eight engines are fueled by natural gas. Power generated by the WGS is transmitted to the grid at 69 kilovolts (kV) through subtransmission lines connected to the Modesto Irrigation District (MID) Enslen Substation.\n\n\n\nThe WGS stores 29 percent aqueous ammonia solution in a single 14,000-gallon aboveground storage tank.

This quantity exceeds the EPA Risk Management Program threshold of 20,000 pounds for concentrations 20 percent or greater and the CalARP Program threshold of 500 pounds of ammonia in solution; therefore, this process is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and CalARP Program regulations. The aqueous ammonia process at the WGS qualifies for Program Level 2.\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia is used at the WGS in an SCR system to control emissions of NOx from natural gas combustion. Aqueous ammonia is vaporized and injected into the exhaust gas stream from WGS Units 1 and 2 and then passed through a catalyst bed. At WGS Unit 3, however, aqueous ammonia is sprayed into the exhaust stream in liquid form and is vaporized and mixed directly in the exhaust before entering the SCR grid. In the presence of the catalyst, the ammonia and NOx react to form nitrogen and water vapor, thereby reducing NOx emissions. Aqueous ammonia is a regulated toxic substance under the EPA Risk Management Program and CalARP Program. This RMP addresses the aqueous ammonia process at the WGS.\n\n\n\nSummary of the Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past 5 years, the WGS has had no accidents involving aqueous ammonia that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nSummary of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe WGS has developed an Emergency Action Plan, which establishes emergency response procedures designed to protect personnel, limit damage to the environment, and ensure that proper notifications go to the appropriate government agencies. The Emergency Action Plan details the response procedures, protective measures, levels of training, regulatory notification requirements, and post-incident investigation procedures.

If the release is controllable, trained WGS personnel will perform the tasks necessary to accomplish containment and mitigation of the release. If the release is uncontrollable, the MID Control Center will notify the Modesto Fire Department. The Modesto Fire Department will handle spill/release response and mitigation. \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan is shared with and periodically reviewed by the Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources. The facility will work closely with the Modesto Fire Department to coordinate response actions by submitting updated Hazardous Materials Business Plans to the Modesto Fire Department, inviting Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources staff to attend hazard reviews of the aqueous ammonia system, and inviting Modesto Fire Department staff to tour the WGS and the aqueous ammonia system. Additionally, employees will be trained on the Emergency Action Plan when initially hired, and all employees will receive annual refresher training on emergency response.\n\n\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nThe prevention program for the aqueous ammonia process is briefly summarized below. \n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\n\n\nThe WGS will compile and maintain up-to-date safety information related to the regulated substances, processes, and equipment.

The hazard review team developed a list of risk-reduction measures to improve safety at the WGS. Details of the recommendations from the hazard review can be found in the Prevention Program document in Section 3 of this RMP. Some of the risk reduction measures considered include implementing routine maintenance procedures for pressure-relief valves, installing bollards near the ammonia storage tank and associated piping, confirming vendor inspection procedures, and providing contractors with project-specific safety tailgate meetings. The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the aqueous ammonia system."
