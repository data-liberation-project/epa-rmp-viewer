The hazard review will be revalidated or updated at least once every 5 years.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe WGS will maintain up-to-date, accurate, and written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for the aqueous ammonia process. Operating procedures are required for applicable stages of system operation, including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown operations, normal shutdown, startup following normal and emergency shutdown, consequences of deviations, steps required to correct or avoid deviations, and equipment inspections.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nWGS staff will complete and maintain all training requirements for his or her position and ensure that all supporting documentation is filed in the control room. Employees must be trained on aqueous ammonia operating or maintenance procedures, safety and health hazards, and safe work practices before they can operate or maintain the covered process. The WGS will develop and maintain the written employee training program and associated training materials and training records. The training program includes initial training, refresher training, and documentation. Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.\r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\r\nThe WGS will implement the maintenance program to ensure the continued integrity of the equipment in the aqueous ammonia process.

This quantity exceeds the EPA Risk Management Program threshold of 20,000 pounds for concentrations 20 percent or greater and the CalARP Program threshold of 500 pounds of ammonia in solution; therefore, this process is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and CalARP Program regulations. The aqueous ammonia process at the WGS qualifies for Program Level 2.\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia is used at the WGS in an SCR system to control emissions of NOx from natural gas combustion. Aqueous ammonia is vaporized and injected into the exhaust gas stream from WGS Units 1 and 2 and then passed through a catalyst bed. At WGS Unit 3, however, aqueous ammonia is sprayed into the exhaust stream in liquid form and is vaporized and mixed directly in the exhaust before entering the SCR grid. In the presence of the catalyst, the ammonia and NOx react to form nitrogen and water vapor, thereby reducing NOx emissions. Aqueous ammonia is a regulated toxic substance under the EPA Risk Management Program and CalARP Program. This RMP addresses the aqueous ammonia process at the WGS.\r\n\r\nSummary of the Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the past 5 years, the WGS has had no accidents involving aqueous ammonia that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nSummary of the Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe WGS has developed an Emergency Action Plan, which establishes emergency response procedures designed to protect personnel, limit damage to the environment, and ensure that proper notifications go to the appropriate government agencies.

The WGS stores and uses aqueous ammonia (29-percent aqueous ammonia solution) in a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to control nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Using and storing aqueous ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. WGS personnel take their safety obligations very seriously and ensure that operators involved in the use of aqueous ammonia are trained and knowledgeable in the chemical hazards associated with their jobs. The following Risk Management Plan (RMP) describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, some of the steps taken to ensure a safely operating power plant, and how chemical emergencies are handled. This RMP complies with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 2, Chapter 4.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe WGS accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. Applicable federal procedures and state of California procedures are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \r\n\r\nWGS facility management recognizes the responsibility to make the environment, community, and employee safety a primary part of daily concerns.

If the release is controllable, trained WGS personnel will perform the tasks necessary to accomplish containment and mitigation of the release. If the release is uncontrollable, the MID Control Center will notify the Modesto Fire Department. The Modesto Fire Department will handle spill/release response and mitigation. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan is shared with and periodically reviewed by the Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources. The facility will work closely with the Modesto Fire Department to coordinate response actions by submitting updated Hazardous Materials Business Plans to the Modesto Fire Department, inviting Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources staff to attend hazard reviews of the aqueous ammonia system, and inviting Modesto Fire Department staff to tour the WGS and the aqueous ammonia system. Additionally, employees will be trained on the Emergency Action Plan when initially hired, and all employees will receive annual refresher training on emergency response.\r\n\r\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\n\r\nThe prevention program for the aqueous ammonia process is briefly summarized below. \r\n\r\nSafety Information\r\n\r\nThe WGS will compile and maintain up-to-date safety information related to the regulated substances, processes, and equipment.

The compliance audits evaluate the prevention program elements and their implementation for compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program and CalARP Program regulations.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nFollowing an incident that resulted in or could have reasonably resulted in a release of aqueous ammonia, WGS staff will initiate incident investigation procedures and ensure that any resulting corrective actions are addressed and documented. The investigation will begin as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours after the incident.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nThe WGS conducted an initial aqueous ammonia hazard review prior to increasing the quantity of aqueous ammonia stored onsite to assess the safety of the process and identify causes of potential aqueous ammonia releases. The hazard review team developed a list of risk-reduction measures to improve safety at the WGS. Details of the recommendations from the hazard review can be found in the Prevention Program document in Section 3 of this RMP. Some of the risk reduction measures considered include implementing routine maintenance procedures for pressure-relief valves, installing bollards near the ammonia storage tank and associated piping, confirming vendor inspection procedures, and providing contractors with project-specific safety tailgate meetings. The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the aqueous ammonia system."
