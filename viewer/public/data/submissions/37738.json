The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Vertex has implemented and maintains the elements of the Vertex Risk Management Program for all operating facilities.  Vertex senior management leadership implements through policy, participation, communications and resource commitments in achieving continuous improvement of performance to control risks of any sort to the community that could be controlled by Vertex.  Additionally, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Vertex is committed to a secure and safe environment, which depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nVertex emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute\u00bfs Pamphlet 64, \u00bfEmergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities\u00bf, the American Chemistry Council\u00bfs Responsible Care(R) Management Systems, and applicable regulations.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  Vertex facility and regulated substances handled\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture sodium hypochlorite for bi-state area customers.  Sodium hypochlorite bleaches for household, commercial and industrial uses are the sole products made by Vertex.  This site is remote from neighbors and protected with natural obstacles.  Access to the site is restricted to au"

      "SummaryText": "thorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine, although no chlorine is shipped out of this facility.  Inventory is maintained at lowest amounts practical to insure continued supply to the water purification and commercial needs of customers.\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Although not subject to OSHA PSM at this time, nonetheless Vertex is in compliance with this rule.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute and is an American Chemistry Council Responsible Care(R) participant.  Many redundant safety and security systems are in place, and every employee involved in Vertex bleach manufacture is trained to Incident Command level in case of an emergency.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history\nVertex Chemical Corporation has three facilities which manufacture sodium hypochlorite using chlorine.  None of these facilities has experienced a reportable spill of chlorine nor any off-site consequences.\n\n5.  The Emergency Response Program\nProcedures have been developed over the fifty-year history of Vertex in bleach manufacture to minimize the possibility of accidental chlorine release.  Multiple safety and security measures have also been implemented/installed.  Vertex emergency response is coordinated with Dupo and East Carondelet Fire and Police Departments as well as the St. Clair County Emergency Management.  Vertex personnel receive annual training, participate in regular safety and security meetings and multiple drills and exercises annually.  This facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute\u00bfs Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  We have hosted meetings at our facility annually,"

This was the second cooperative drill in 2003.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety\nThis facility was constructed in 1967, with the most recent upgrade in 2003.  It is in compliance with Chlorine Institute guidelines.  We continue to participate in the Chlorine Institute programs, and continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Care(R) Management System guidelines and all applicable regulations."
