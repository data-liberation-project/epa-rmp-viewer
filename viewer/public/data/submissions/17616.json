Therefore, analysis of regulated flammable substances are not required.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nOne alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for the toxic substance above threshold quantity.\n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen by the facility was a 1/8 inch pump seal leak for a duration of 5 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoints for the alternative-case releases is presented in Table 3.  The alternative-case release resulted in an 0.02-mile distance to the 0.14 mg/L ERPG-2 endpoint for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nTable 3\nDistance to Endpoint for Toxic Alternative Release Scenario\n\nChemical Name                                  Ammonia (anhydrous)\nAmount Released (lbs)                                7.9\nRelease Rate (lbs/min)                                1.586\nToxic Endpoint ERPG-2  (mg/L)                    0.14\nDistance to Endpoint ERPG-2 (miles)           0.02\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Coffeyville Facility.

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include, regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Coffeyville Facility actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and failure mode and effect or the deductive fault tree technique.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria: \n\n7 age of process; \n7 extent of process hazards; \n7 number of affected employees; and \n7 operating history of the process.  \n\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both operations and management personnel participate as audit team members with at least one person knowledgeable in the audit techniques.  The audit team develops findings in a report that is forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked and documented until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are retained.\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Coffeyville Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Coffeyville Facility.

      "SummaryText": "Safety Features\n\nThe Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrogen Sulfide sensors with audible alarms.\n2. High pressure and low pressure sensors.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Pressure relief valves on railcars designed to relieve at 75 psi.\n2. Key manual valves are chained and padlocked in their critical (open/closed) position.\n3. Excess flow check valves designed to plug the outlet if outflow reaches equivalent of 90 lbs/min.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Standard operating procedures that control, isolate, and terminate leaks.\n2. Personnel trained in emergency procedures.\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., escape respirator, self-contained breathing apparatus, and supplied air breathing apparatus).\n4. Ventilate contaminated areas.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Coffeyville Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. There have been no incidents involving a release of anhydrous ammonia that caused offsite impacts.\n\nEmergency Procedure Information\n\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures account for the possibility of a toxic substance being accidentally released, as well as for the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures. The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Facility.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nTh"

      "SummaryText": "Coffeyville Facility Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Coffeyville Facility (Facility) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (Tessenderlo Kerley) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tessenderlo Kerley Facility is located in Montgomery County on N. Laurel St. in Coffeyville, Kansas.  The Facility is outside of the Coffeyville city limits located next to the Farmland Refinery.\n\nThe Facility produces and distributes chemicals, which are used in agricultural and industrial applications.  Production at the Facility consists of ammonium thiosulfate, ammonium bisulfite, potassium thiosulfate,  and molten sulfur.  \n\nThese chemicals utilize several regulated and non-regulated substances as raw materials.  The covered substances used is anhydrous ammonia.  The products and raw materials require loading/unloading operations at the Facility, as well as the associated process and storage equipment\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Tessenderlo Kerley identified no listed flammable substances and one toxic regulated substance kept on site.  The chemicals, largest quantity on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1\nLargest Quantity of Regulated Substances\n\nRegulated Substances         Largest Quantity On Site (lbs)      Threshold Quantity (lbs)\nAmmonia (anhydrous)                 1448"

Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Facility is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the Coffeyville Facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances at the Coffeyville Facility.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe endpoint for a worst-case release of a toxic substance is based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association. The ARP Program requirement for toxics, in a worst-case scenario, assumes total quantity released in ten minutes. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release of the above threshold quantity toxic substance using the EPA equations is presented in Table 2. Anhydrous ammonia has a worst-case toxic release of a 6.62-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nTABLE 2\nDistance to Endpoint for Toxic Worst-Case Scenario\n\nChemical Name                              Ammonia (anhydrous)\nStorage Capacity (gallons)                   25,500\nWeight (lbs)                                        144,840\nToxic Endpoint ERPG-2 (mg/L)              0.14\nDistance to ERPG-2 (miles)                   4.13\n\n\nAlternative Releases Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario. Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including onsite damage. Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  The alternative release scenarios may also represent cases included in either the five-"
