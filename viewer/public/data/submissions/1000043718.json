The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in St. Joseph are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the St. Joseph Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry, liquid fertilizers, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The facility also handles liquid and dry pesticides, seed and feed.\n\n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1999\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". \n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nAn accident occurred on March 24, 2014 when an employee was in the process of disconnecting the hose end valve on a transfer hose after filling a nurse tank. In the process of bleeding the connection, the employee failed to allow the pressure to bleed completely at the transfer connection point.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.

Local\n\n           emergency responders will be notified to control any release.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. Currently the facility is evaluating the requirements of CGA 2.1, 2014 and Process Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and will make the required upgrades needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n12/9/16\n\n\n\n"
