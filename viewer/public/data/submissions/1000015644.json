The City of Maitland population is approximately 16,150.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nNeel-Schafer, Inc. was retained to assist with our Compliance Audit.  This began on Dec 15, 2009 and was completed Jan 13, 2010.  Their report for the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) show although the population may have changed, the origional Worst Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario information still apply.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nChanges here include an upgrade in the training program from every three years to an annual program and now include a written exam to test the employees knowledge and understanding of our chlorine process and safety equipment.  We have also installed security cameras to monitor for unauthorized entry to our Water Treatment Plants.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n \nWTP 6 has had no reportable accidental releases within the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe City of Maitland's Emergency Responder is the Fire Department.  The Utilities employees will not be responding directly to non-incidental releases of chlorine gas."
