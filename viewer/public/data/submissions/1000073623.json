Dystar manufactures auxiliary chemicals for the textile industry and the leather industry as well as custom chemical manufacturing.\r\n\r\nDystar's manufacturing plant operates batch reactors that synthe chemicals to support the textile and leather industry.

The acetone is charged into the reactor utilizing a vacuum process the same as Formaldehyde. The acetone is transferred from a storage tank via jumper hose that is not permanently connected. For safety purposes, the headspace in the acetone storage tank is blanketed with Nitrogen thus removing all oxygen and preventing possibility of ignition\r\n6.\tAdditional constituents are added per operating procedures.

Through a formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) minor action items were identified for review and possible corrective action. Each action item was assigned to a responsible individual(s).  \r\n\r\nDystar committed to continuous improvement especially as it relates to EH&S systems and processes."

Any group of vessels that are interconnected and separate vessels that are located such that a highly hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\r\nOur PSM / RMP prevents accidents because it focuses on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all persons at the facility.\r\nAt the same time, our PSM / RMP covers not only highly hazardous chemicals, but also those that may be harmless in terms of flammability, explosiveness, or toxicity, but, when mixed with another substance, can produce a highly hazardous substance or situation. The accidental mixing of some reactive chemicals can cause explosions or the release of toxic vapors - situations that are clearly a threat to the life and health of workers at the site.\r\nLike all PSM / RMP written programs, Dystar's contains at a minimum the following major elements:\r\n\u00bf\tPurpose statement, \r\n\u00bf\tEmployee participation plan, \r\n\u00bf\tProcess safety information, \r\n\u00bf\tProcess hazard analysis records, \r\n\u00bf\tOperating procedures, \r\n\u00bf\tTraining, \r\n\u00bf\tContracting, \r\n\u00bf\tProcess equipment integrity maintenance procedures, \r\n\u00bf\tNon-routine work, \r\n\u00bf\tManagement of change procedures, \r\n\u00bf\tIncident investigation reports, \r\n\u00bf\tCompliance audit reports, and \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nAdditional Prevention Program Practices\r\n \r\n\u00bf\tA formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is performed using Hazard Review Leader software and a diverse team of subject matter experts\r\n\u00bf\tCorrective action is taken as needed based on r"
