      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and staff of the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant are committed to operating the Plant with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment, the Plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Plant's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nDescription of Processes, and Regulated Substances Handled at the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant\n\nThe Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant produces fluid milk and ice cream products.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages:  Liquid storage; Expansion; Evaporation; Compression; and Condensation.\n\nMechanical refrigeration is a physical process, rather than a chemical process:  the ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the refrigeration cycle.  Heat is removed from the product being refrigerated or frozen as ammonia changes phase from liquid to vapor.  By reliquefying the ammonia vapor, the ammonia can be used continuously in the refrigeration cycle.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant which is subject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nAt ambient temperature and pressure, ammonia is a colorless gas with a characteristic, irritating odor.  Ammonia is highly soluble in water.  Ammonia i"

      "SummaryText": "s the third highest-volume chemical produced in the United States.  The chemical formula of ammonia is NH3.  Anhydrous ammonia is handled both as a pressurized liquid at ambient temperature and as a refrigerated liquid at or below ambient pressure within the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant refrigeration system.\n\nThe toxic endpoint to which the consequences of ammonia releases must be analyzed is 0.14 mg/L.  This is approximately equal to 200 ppmv, which corresponds to the American Industrial Hygiene Association's Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2) for ammonia.  ERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario, and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Plant's worst-case release scenario consists of a total release of the maximum allowable inventory of the High Pressure Receiver over a duration of ten minutes.  The maximum allowable inventory is approximately 30,000 pounds.  The maximum allowable inventory is the largest quantity of ammonia that could be contained in the High Pressure Receiver without allowing the vessel to become liquid-full at 115 degrees Fahrenheit, which corresponds to the vessel's pressure relief set point of 250 psig.\n\nEPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" was used to evaluate the worst-case release scenario.  The following inputs were applied:  wind speed, 1.5 m/s; stability class, F; topography, urban; release duration, 10 minutes; release rate, 3000 lbs/min.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint was evaluated as 2.0 miles.\n\nUsing Landview III, the population within 2.0 miles of the release point was estimated as 42,000.  The following types of public receptors lie within 2.0 miles of the release point:  schools, res"

There are no environmental receptors, as defined in the RMP rule, within 2.0 miles of the release point.\n\nEPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" was used to evaluate the alternative release scenario.  The Plant's alternative release scenario consists of a pressurized liquid ammonia release through a <\" diameter hole in outdoor piping downstream from the evaporative condenser.  The release is assumed to persist for 10 minutes prior to isolation (which can safely and rapidly be accomplished remotely).  The pressure in the piping is assumed to be 130 psig, at a temperature of 25 degrees C.  Under these conditions, the release rate was found to be 110 lbs/min, and the total quantity released was 1100 lbs.\n\nThe following inputs were assumed:  wind speed, 3 m/s; stability class, D; topography, urban.  Combining these inputs with the release rate described above, the distance to 200 ppmv ammonia was found to be 0.1 mi.  Note that the EPA guidance conservatively assumes that the release occurs at ground level.  A release from the elevation of the evaporative condenser would actually be accompanied by dilution due to vertical dispersion, resulting in a somewhat shorter distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe population within 0.1 is estimated to be 100.  The following types of public receptors lie within the distances to the endpoints described above: residences, and major commercial/office/industrial areas. There are no environmental receptors, as defined in the RMP rule, within 0.1 miles of the release point.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Plant's accidental release prevention program consists of the following elements:  Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; Compliance Audits; and Em"
