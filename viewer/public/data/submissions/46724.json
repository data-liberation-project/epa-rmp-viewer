The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features. \n\nChlorine Processes:   Chlorine is fed through a short length of piping to an eductor, where it is safely absorbed into process water.  This vacuum operated system provides a high degree of reliability and safety. Our chlorine systems are located indoors within isolated room areas, which further reduces the potential for a chlorine release impacting the surrounding area.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in areas where chlorine could be present if a release occurs.   These alarms sound at the chlorine room areas, and also on operator control displays, which are constantly monitored to help ensure quick response. \n\nChlorine Dioxide System: Chlorine dioxide gas is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to a water absorption column, where a 1.2 wt % chlorine dioxide solution is generated. Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Quinnesec Mill and stored as a dilute water solution to minimize the potential for serious incident or off-site impact.  The process is located almost entirely indoors, which further reduces the hazard.  Storage tanks are engineered specifically for chlorine dioxide service.  The process uses an advanced control system, with emergency shutdowns, to ensure safe operation.  Containment sewers and curbing are provided to minimize the extent of potential leaks. Detectors and alarms provide continuous monitoring for chlorine dioxide in the event of a release, providing early detection and helping to ensure quick response if an incident were to occur.\n\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\n\nDuring the five year period prior to September 2006 there were no reportable incidents.

Executive Summary \n\nVerso Paper owns and operates the Quinnesec Mill, an integrated pulp and paper facility located approximately 2 miles east of Quinnesec, Michigan. The Quinnesec Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for employees, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, Verso Paper has developed and implemented Environmental, Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all of it's employees and operations. Following these policies is the responsibility of every employee. \n\nAs part of this commitment, a system has been established to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Quinnesec Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Quinnesec Mill.\n\nThe risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n\t1. A hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases including a history of accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\t2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\t3.

In fact, a comprehensive safety program is in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance. \n\nHazardous substance uses are limited at the Quinnesec Mill.  Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered. Part of the RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, considerations are made for the potential for this substance to adversely affect mill employees, the public, and the environment and steps are taken to prevent any such effects.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Quinnesec Mill is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes, and programs to evaluate hazards.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release emergency procedures are enacted to control and contain the release in a manner that will minimize potential injury to employees, the public or the environment.  The mill provides response training to employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.

Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, a management system lead by the Mill Manager has been implemented to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 Regulated Substances\n\nThe Quinnesec Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related finished paper products.  As part of this manufacturing process, regulated substances are handled in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  The RMP-covered substances are Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide.  \n\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \n\nThe Quinnesec Mill has always focused on ways to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the mill formally implemented the 14 elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996 the EPA RMP rule established Program 3 prevention requirements which were subsequently implemented by the mill.\n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  Program 3 requires 12 of the 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulation and is the most rigorous prevention program. It has been established for the Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide Systems.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements. \n\n1.3.1  Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Quinnesec Mill Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\t1.\tProcess Safety Information: The mill maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the covered processes.  These documents address (1) the physical properties of hazardous substances handled in these processes, (2) the operating parameters of the eq"

Information on the technology and engineering design aspects include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the process equipment.\n\t\tMany of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used to train employees, to perform process hazards analyses, and to help maintain the equipment.\n\n\t2. \tProcess Hazard Analysis:  The Quinnesec Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique is used primarily, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to area personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n\n\t3.\tOperating Procedures: Mill operators, process engineers and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n\t\tOperating procedures have been developed and are maintained.

The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the process operation prior to job assignment.\n\n\t\tThe operators are consulted annually during operating procedure reviews to evaluate the effectiveness and need for additional training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented, as appropriate.\n\n\t5.\tMechanical Integrity:  Mechanical integrity of process equipment is maintained to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger employees, the public, or the environment.  This is accomplished by: (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes and (3) utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.  \n\n\t6.\tManagement of Change:  The management of change program requires evaluation and approval of all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.
