The procedures include all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and other medical procedures, the use of emergency equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, evacuation plans, and community emergency response notification procedures.\n\nProcedures for maintaining emergency response equipment are also contained in the emergency response plan.

Our hazard assessment focuses on preventing injuries to plant personnel and the community, and preventing adverse impacts to the environment.\n\nA hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) or a What if?/Checklist is typically used for a process hazard analysis.  A team comprised of personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making recommendations for improvement when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are reviewed by management and are tracked until they are resolved.\n\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every 5 years.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\nVI.\tOperating Procedures\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as: 1) unit start up; 2) normal operations; 3) temporary operations; 4) emergency shutdown; 5) normal shutdown; and 6) initial start-up of a new or improved process.  Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are updated following process changes and are annually certified to ensure their accuracy.\n \nVII.\tTraining\nERCO trains workers to safe"

After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\n\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  Both classroom and on-the-job training is provided.  In addition to training in specific job functions, training is also provided on safe work practices.  The frequency of refresher training is decided upon with input from our employees and is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training was understood.\n\nVIII.\tMechanical Integrity\nERCO maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program is intended to help identify equipment damage or deterioration before equipment fails.  Predictive maintenance technologies employed include vibration analysis, thermography, and ultrasonic analysis.  Vibration analysis is used for early detection of bearing problems on pumps and motors.  Thermography is used to locate problems on electrical equipment.  And ultrasonic technology is used to determine the thickness of tank walls and piping.  When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem and try to identify the root causes of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided.

This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted.  A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that:\n1)\tConstruction and equipment are consistent with design standards;\n2)\tAdequate operating, safety, and maintenance procedures are in place;\n3)\tTraining for all affected employees is complete;\n4)\tA process hazard analysis has been performed;\n5)\tProcess hazard analysis recommendations have been addressed; and\n6)\tActions required for start-up have been completed.\n\nXI.\tInc"
