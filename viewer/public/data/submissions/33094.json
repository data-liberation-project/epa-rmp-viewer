A 500 pound release resulted in the evacuation of approximately 50 people.  \n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which addresses accidental releases of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Washington County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Springdale fire department.  The facility is included in the LEPC's community emergency response plan.  The facility has an inhouse hazmat team which trains regularly and maintains compliance with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation 1910.120.    \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThe most recent proces hazard analysis was performed on10/03/03.  The facility continues to monitor and maintain it's PSM/RMP program through an organized PSM team chartered to ensure all elements of the PSM/RMP rpogram are in place."

Written policies exist to address written policy requirements from OSHA (i.e., chemical hazard communication, lockout tagout, confined space entry, emergency action plans, hot work, line breaking, and PSM) in addition a written contractor safety program is in place.\n\nSenior management has appointed a PSM Coordinator to monitor and maintain overall compliance with both OSAHA's PSM and EPA's RMP regualtions.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances:\nThe stationary source subect to this RMP is Cargill's turkey processing facility locted in Springdale, Arkansas.  The regulated substance that is the subject of this RMP is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facilitey's ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety informaiton, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and is periodically audited for compliance as required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineerin"
