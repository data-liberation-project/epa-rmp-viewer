      "SummaryText": "Purnell Sausage slaughters hogs and manufactures sausage and related food products.  Ammonia, a potentially hazardous chemical, is stored and used on-site as a refrigerant.  It is an environmentally safe chemical for maintaining safe storage temperatures for food products, but could pose a hazard if large quantities were released.  However, ammonia is a non-ozone depleting, environmentally safe refrigerant if used safely and responsibly.  We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment by training all employees in safe work practices.  Our maintenance staff is also trained in safe handling and control procedures.  Our on-site maintenance staff is assisted by our external contractor, Ohio Valley Mechanical.  Ohio Valley Mechanical was selected for its licensed professional staff, which includes professional engineers, certified welders, and licensed refrigeration and HVAC technicians.\n        Purnell Sausage is committed to operating in an environmentally responsible and safe manner.  We are dedicated to following OSHA and EPA guidelines to maintain employee and community safety. Our accident prevention program includes active employee participation and precautions, maintenance, monitoring, and employee training that focuses on accident prevention.  This facility maintains open communication with the local emergency response team to ensure preparedness of emergency responders.  Our LEPC is aware of the materials at our site and includes our plant risk analysis in local planning efforts."
