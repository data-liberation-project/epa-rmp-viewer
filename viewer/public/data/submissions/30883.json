      "SummaryText": "Release prevention and emergency response policies\nPersonnel at this Marshall Municipal Utilities (MMU) facility are active in maintaining and improving chemical safety.  This facility complies with industry-standard requirements for water treatment plants that use chlorine in ton containers.  MMU's policy is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, our policy is to notify the City of Marshall Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility and regulated substance   \nThis facility is a water treatment plant located northwest of Marshall, Missouri.  The facility employs a series of physical and chemical treatment operations that include aeration, primary and secondary clarification, disinfection, and final filtration.  The water is then transferred to one of several reservoirs and is pumped into the distribution system.  The covered process is chlorine storage and feed.  The chlorine is delivered by truck in one-ton containers and the maximum intended inventory at the facility is 28,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program complies with the corresponding sections of EPA's 40 CFR part 68 accident prevention program rule for program level 2 processes and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorine system was designed, installed, and is maintained in accordance with state and local laws and industry codes.  To achieve and maintain this compliance, MMU has safeguards in place.  These include operating and maintenance procedures, employee training, frequent checks for leaks, and a vacuum system where the chlorine pressure is cut to vacuum at the container.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of chlorine and, failing that, to minimize the effects of a release.\n\nFive-year accident history\nIn the last five years, this facility has not had an accident, involving chlorine, that caused deaths, injuries, property or environme"

The Marshall Fire Department is the primary responder.  MMU employees handle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so.  Larger releases of chlorine are handled by the Fire Department.\n\nThe emergency action plan includes emergency situation identification, procedures for reporting emergencies internally, evacuation, and responder notification.  The plan also addresses the interaction with the City Fire Department.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nThe maintenance and improvement of safety is an ongoing job at this facility.  Safety training takes place throughout the year.  Safety-related recommendations from employees, whether made during formal sessions like the hazard review or made upon observation of a potential hazard, are always considered carefully for implementation.  This feedback process is continuous and, even at times when no major process changes are anticipated, existing safety systems and procedures are fine-tuned as a matter of course.  MMU will be revising the emergency response/operations plan for the water treatment plant the last half of 2004."
