Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt this distribution facility, we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility is to repackage and distribute chlorine and  sulfur dioxide to water treatment facilities and general industry.  We also manufacture sodium hypochlorite (bleach) as a byproduct of the chlorine repackaging operation and  manufacture sodium bisulfite as a byproduct of sulfur dioxide repackaging.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received by rail car.  Chlorine is also received in 150 pound cylinders and ton containers which are filled at other facilities.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide from rail cars is used to fill DOT approved containers.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The maximum total inventory of chlorine at this facility is 650,000 pounds.  The maximum total inventory of sulfur dioxide stored at this facility is 360,000 pounds.  Average inventories are much less.\n\n\n3. The general accidental r"

      "SummaryText": "elease prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nIn the past 5 years, this facility has had two accidents that meet the criteria for reporting in this section:\n\nOn June 13, 2002, a small chlorine leak of approximately 2 pounds slightly injured 2 employees.  The 2 employees were treated by a physician and returned to work the next day.  The leak was caused by employees not following procedure and putting too much pressure on a chlorine rail car.  The over-pressure caused a small leak at a process vessel before the system was shut down.  The employees were re-instructed on the proper procedure.\n\nOn October 6, 2003, a chlorine release of 700 pounds was caused when an operator inadvertently opened a valve too far and fed more chlorine into the process than it could handle.  There were no known injuries but public responders asked about 50 people downwind of the release to ?shelter-in-place? for a short time as a precaution.  As a result of this release, all operators were retrained in the applicable procedure.  Also, an additional automatic shutdown valve was installed which should prevent a similar human error from causing a release or at least minimize the size of the release.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required.  All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment on simulated leaks.  We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The "

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThis distribution facility was constructed in 1977.  We continue to participate in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  In the past year, this facility has greatly improved its maintenance capabilities which will allow us to implement safety improvements much more efficiently.\n\nIn 2003, we developed a new security plan to help guard against intentional misuse of hazardous chemicals.  We are continuing to evaluate and implement new security measures by sharing knowledge with other Harcros facilities and general industry."
