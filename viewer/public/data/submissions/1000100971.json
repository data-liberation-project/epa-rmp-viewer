The plant's written emergency plan is integrated with Dow's plan, and all external communications are coordinated in accordance with our written plan; Dow manages alerts to the community through the Care hotline.\r\nDetailed Seadrift Site emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the local emergency planning committee  and the community.  A Mutual Aid Network has been established with the local emergency planning committee and other local chemical plants to further enhance the ability to respond to an emergency.    \r\nThe facility updates its emergency response program, as appropriate, in response to modifications to facility processes or regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nBraskem believes in the philosophy of continuous improvement.  Programs are in place to monitor the status of ongoing efforts and identify opportunities to improve.  The Seadrift plant maintains a structured safety process, as well as employee safety teams that meet regularly.\r\n\r\nThe Plant has not identified any changes to safety practices necessary to achieve or maintain compliance with any applicable regulatory standard since our last submission.  However, as part of our efforts to continually improve safety at the plant, several projects are currently in-progress to further enhance safety including the following: Pressure Safety Valves (PSVs) documentation Project, Piping labeling in the field Project, and Modicon Software & CPU Upgrade Project."

Braskem's programs satisfy or exceed all applicable requirements under both the   Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).  To ensure that our programs remain fully compliant, we periodically re-validate our Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) for covered processes to ensure that process hazards remain properly identified, understood, and adequately mitigated. We also utilize these PHA revalidations to identify opportunities for further safety enhancements as needed.  Braskem also conducts periodic compliance audits to ensure maintenance of administrative policies and mitigation controls to help prevent accidents and releases. The facility manager retains primary responsibility for safe operation of the facility.
