No products are manufactured at this location.  The facility consists of a single building which contains warehouse operations, a quality laboratory, shipping/receiving docks, and office and meeting areas. \n\nIn addition to various BiC finished consumer products, the facility handles several types of BiC lighters, all of which contain less than 5 grams of liquified isobutane gas per lighter. Isobutane is a regulated substance under the US EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) with flammability similar to propane. The facility receives pallets of cartons of packaged lighters by truck/trailer and unloads them using forklifts. The lighters are already packaged, ready for shipment to retailers and consumers.  The number of lighters in each carton or pallet depends on the type of lighter, and the customers' demands for the size and ap"

      "SummaryText": "pearance of the consumer packaging. Each carton style has been designed, tested and approved to meet US DOT requirements to protect lighters from damage and prevent activation or release of gas during shipping and handling. The incoming pallets are placed into rack storage. As customer orders are received, individual pallets of lighters are transferred to the sorting area of the facility via forklift. From this location, individual cartons of lighters are placed by hand onto a conveyor system which labels each carton and collates the products required to fill each order. At the end of the conveyor, the individual cartons of products are recombined together by hand on to pallets and loaded onto trucks/trailers via forklift for shipment to the customer. \n\nThe facility is regulated under the Program 1 requirements under the applicability criteria of 40 CFR \u00a768.10, which means that there are no off-site consequences from the handling and storage of isobutane.  \n\nThe lighter itself is the gas container. The lighter device is made of engineering-grade plastics and metal, designed to withstand high pressures and physical damage. The gas is in the form of a liquified isobutane gas, or LPG. There are several sizes of lighters and the largest contains less than 5 grams of gas.  In this facility, the vast majority of lighters remain inside of multiple layers of packaging - the individual lighters are not handled so there is no release of the gas.  The only reasonable scenario for a gas release is the physical crushing of a lighter during handling.  Because the lighters remain in protective packaging, breakage is exceptionally rare. If a lighter is crushed, the LPG isobutane rapidly escapes from the lighter, expands quickly and typically dissipates to non-flammable levels a few feet from the release point.  Because of the small amount of gas in each container, nearly 95 lighters would have to be crushed simultaneously to produce one pound of gas - the minimum amount of gas nece"

In any case, there is absolutely no reasonable scenario that could result in an explosive impact that extends off site.\n\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at This Facility\n\nBIC Group maintains an overall Environmental, Health, and Safety policy which commits BIC to pollution prevention; risk prevention; regulatory compliance; continuous improvement; and awareness and involvement. The facility develops and implements programs in support of these Group commitments, including programs for accidental release prevention and emergency response.  Environmental and Safety programs are managed by a full time Manager, Environment and Safety who directly serves the BIC Charlotte, NC facilities. The Manager, Environment and Safety works with facility staff to administer several programs which contribute to release prevention including safe work practices, employee training, preventative maintenance and administrative controls designed to ensure that hazards are identified and that safety issues are identified and addressed.\n\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPrevention of accidental releases at the facility is accomplished through compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention provisions; compliance with federal and state environmental, safety, packaging and shipping regulations; and, the application of longstanding corporate philosophies and initiatives which help support safe operations. The following are a few of the examples of the prevention measures which are relevant to this facility:\n\na.\tBIC Group performs extensive in-line quality testing of every individual lighter produced which not only guarantees safe and reliable operation of the product by the consumer, but also provides an additional measure of safety for all storage and war"
