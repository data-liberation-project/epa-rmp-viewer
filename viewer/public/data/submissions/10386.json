Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at SERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Bellflower Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facilitys primary activities encompass RETAIL FERTILIZER, AG CHEMICAL AND PROPANE SALES.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Propane and Ammonia.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Propane is used for heating and grain drying.  Ammonia is used for Agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Propane at our facility is 128000 lb. while Ammonia is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 102,000 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenariosand alternative cases we have used  the EPA's RMP Guidance for Propane facilities and The Fertilizer Institutes'  DEGADIS model for Worst-Case Ammonia Release.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Anhydrous Ammon"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 200ppm.\n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from Nh3 Bellflower in the Anhydrous Ammonia Bulk Plant process.  The scenario involves the release of 11908 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 2 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include excess flow valve(s) and neutralization.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200ppm of Ammonia is 1.2 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Bulk LP Plant in the Bulk Propane Plant process.  The scenario involves the release of 107500 lb. of Propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.4 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Bulk LP Plant in the Bulk Propane Plant.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 107500 lb. of Propane in 10 minutes.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include excess flow valve(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.3 miles.\n\n\n\n4.
