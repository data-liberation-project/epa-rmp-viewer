Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at SERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Bellflower Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facilitys primary activities encompass RETAIL FERTILIZER, AG CHEMICAL AND PROPANE SALES.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Propane and Ammonia.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Propane is used for heating and grain drying.  Ammonia is used for Agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Propane at our facility is 128000 lb. while Ammonia is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 102,000 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenariosand alternative cases we have used  the EPA's RMP Guidance for Propane facilities and The Fertilizer Institutes'  DEGADIS model for Worst-Case Ammonia Release.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Anhydrous Ammon"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 200ppm.\n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from Nh3 Bellflower in the Anhydrous Ammonia Bulk Plant process.  The scenario involves the release of 11908 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 2 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include excess flow valve(s) and neutralization.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200ppm of Ammonia is 1.2 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Bulk LP Plant in the Bulk Propane Plant process.  The scenario involves the release of 107500 lb. of Propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.4 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Bulk LP Plant in the Bulk Propane Plant.

A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility rountinely conducts facility inspections to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The inpections are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and are revalidated.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, SERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nSERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least yearly and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nSERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at SERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at SERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC..  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nSERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nSERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
