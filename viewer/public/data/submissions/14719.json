In addition, public receptors are present in the toxic endpoint zone for the regulated chemicals present.  For these reasons, the \"Rutile Production Process\" at this plant is deemed to be subject to Program 3 requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n2.\tOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS PARAMETERS\n\nThe following parameters were used in determining offsite consequences for the Rutile Production Process at the plant handling the regulated toxic chemicals chlorine and titanium tetrachloride. Worst case and alternate case release scenarios were examined using the RMPCompTM Version 1.06 software developed by EPA for this purpose. The calculations performed by the software are equivalent to those in the EPA RMP Offsite Consequences Analysis Guidance. \n\nEndpoints\n\nAs required by EPA, the toxic endpoint of chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L and the toxic endpoint of titanium tetrachloride is 0.020 mg/L. These endpoints were used in defining offsite consequences in worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.\n\n\nWind Speed, Atmospheric Stability Class\n\nAs required by EPA, a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s) and an atmospheric stability class F were used in performing the offsite consequence analysis for the worst case release scenario for each regulated substance present. For alternative release scenarios, the EPA default parameters were used. They are a wind speed of 3.0 m/s and an atmospheric stability class of D. \n\nAmbient Temperature/Humidity\n\nDefault values for ambient temperature and humidity are incorporated in the RMPCompTM software developed by EPA. The default temperature of 25 degrees C (77 degrees F) and default humidity value of 50 percent were used as inputs for all scenarios. \n\nHeight of Release\n\nThe RMP regulation requires that, for the worst case release analysis, the release should be assumed to occur at ground level (0 feet).

Our worst case and alternate release scenarios were performed for this level.\n\nSurface Roughness\n\nRMP regulations require that either urban or rural topography should be used in performing air dispersion analysis for unidentified release scenarios.  These topographies are characterized in air dispersion models in terms of surface roughness.  A rural condition, defined by EPA (68.22(e)) as \"no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed in the immediate area\", whereas an urban condition is characterized by \"many obstacles in the immediate area (EPA RMP Comp Guidance). Urban conditions were used in both the worst case release and alternative case release scenarios. \n\nDense or Neutrally Buoyant Gases\n\nRMP regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis should appropriately account for the density of the released gas. Default values for gas density are incorporated in the RMP CompTM software developed by EPA for chlorine and titanium tetrachloride.  The default values were used in all release scenarios. \n\n\nTemperature of Released Substance\n\nThe chlorine storage temperature coincides with the ambient temperature.  Therefore, the temperature for a chlorine release is the same as the ambient temperature. For titanium tetrachloride, the process storage temperature of 85 degrees F was used.\n\n\n3.\t\tWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS  \n\nRMP regulations require that a worst case release scenario be performed in compliance with specified conditions, as detailed below.\n\nNumber of Release Scenarios\n\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require performing a consequence analysis for one worst case release scenario, estimated to present the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint.  \n\n\n\nDispersion Modeling Results\n\nThe dispersion modeling results of the worst case analysis are presented in the Hawkins Point Plant's submission of RMP Submit.\n\n4.\t\tALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYS"

The regulations require that a scenario that is more realistic than the worst case scenario is selected as the alternative release. The rationale for the selected scenarios, which are more credible than the worst case scenario discussed above, was the identification of possible failure scenarios.\n\n\n\nIn performing these analyses, alternative scenarios were considered for each of the two regulated substances present, chlorine and titanium tetrachloride. The scenarios selected for chlorine, involves the release from a transfer line on a chlorine railcar. The scenario selected for titanium tetrachloride involved a storage vessel overflow due to overfilling the vessel. Summaries of the scenarios and the modeled output are included as Appendix A.\n\nThe chlorine transfer line rupture is assumed to release 2500 pounds of chlorine during a 5 minute period at a rate of 500 pounds per minute.  The release quantity is assumed not to be limited by the excess flow valves located on the railcar.  The 5 minute duration is based on known operator response times needed to control the release established through previous incidents and training drills.
