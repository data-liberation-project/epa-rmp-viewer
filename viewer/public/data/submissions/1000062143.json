In addition we are committed to developing and maintaining the manpower, the equipment and the emergency response procedures necessary to mitigate a release quickly and effectively if it does occur. Employees and management meet regularly to discuss ongoing operations, potential problems, and continuous improvements to prevent releases from occurring. Trained emergency response personnel will respond immediately to any release or potential release, evaluate the situation, and determine the need to call outside emergency responders.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas facility is located at 6775 Central Avenue in Newark, California, which is approximately 1.1 miles southwest of Interstate 880.  The facility stores cylinders of compressed specialty/industrial gas in both large and small quantities. The cylinders vary from 2000 pounds to less than 1 pound of gas, depending on the size of the cylinder and the type of chemical packaged.\n\n\n\nThere are 10 chemicals in 15 processes at the Matheson Tri-Gas Newark facility that are regulated under the Federal RMP Program.  All regulated processes consist of cylinder storage only.  The detailed applicability of all chemicals, including inventory levels, is listed in the on-site California RMP (Cal-ARP) documentation. The processes regulated by Federal RMP regulations can be summarized as follows:\n\n  \n\nChemical ------ Process\n\n\n\nAmmonia ------ Bldg 7 NH3 Storage\n\nAmmonia ------ Bldg 5 NH3 Storage\n\nArsine ----- Bldg 7 AsH3 Cylinder Storage\n\nArsine ----- Bldg 5 AsH3 Cylinder Sto"

A state-of-the-art life safety system was installed in late 1999 and early 2000.  This system monitors the presence of various toxic and flammable gases in areas where those gases are stored or processed.  Two-stage alarms are set for each sensor.  The low-level alarm alerts the facility that a problem may be developing.  The high-level alarm provides notification to the Fire Department as well as to the facility.  The system provides real time readouts of gas concentrations and records information that assists in both preventing and mitigating gas releases as well as information that can assist in improving the process.  \n\n\n\nAdherence to objective equipment standards.  One of the most significant contributors to the prevention of accidental releases at this site is the high standards to which all gas cylinders must be manufactured.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) has detailed requirements for manufacturing and testing cylinders. Cylinders must be manufactured according to a particular metallurgical standard and be able to withstand overfilling; an increase in pressure; an increase in temperature and the possibility that they will be hit or fall over.     \n\n\n\nProcess hazard analysis.

There is a system established for creating, reviewing, and maintaining operating procedures.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive training program that includes classroom and on-the-job training. Training has been established for new and existing employees such that safety in operations is maintained.\n\n\n\nA systematic preventive maintenance program.  All relevant equipment is on a schedule for inspection; inspections are documented and certain equipment is replaced on a regular schedule. \n\n\n\nA thorough accident reporting and investigation program.  The accident/incident reporting and investigation procedure requires the reporting and investigation not only of incidents resulting in injuries, but also incidents that had the potential to result in an injury to an employee or a significant impact on the company's business. \n\n\n\nRestricted access. There are a series of internal and external electronic gates that restrict access into the facility. There are personnel on-site 24/7/365 to inspect and safeguard all equipment and storage. Motion detectors and facility cameras are available for recording activity through the plant.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.  The release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n1) On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n2) Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no releases of regulated substances from the covered processes that meet above criteria.

A cylinder storage procedure maintains consistent locations for each material.  Any changes in chemical storage locations are documented annually with the County of Alameda Department of Environmental Health in the facility's Hazardous Materials Business Plan.\n\n\n\nERT members must go through refresher training every year. At least four responders are always available at all times. Appropriate personal protective equipment is maintained at the site for response actions. \n\n\n\nEvacuation routes and procedures have been developed and all personnel are trained in the procedures. The Emergency Response Contact List is maintained and all personnel are trained on the portions relevant to their job.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas has made enhancements to improve safety at the facility.  For example, the facility has discontinued the use of the boron trichloride and chlorine purification processes, which were previously regulated under CalARP. The systems involved the processing of toxic and corrosive gases.  The chemicals have been removed from the systems, and the equipment has been shut down and properly isolated.  With the systems no longer in service, the likelihood of an accidental release as a result of equipment failure or human factor issues is significantly reduced, thereby improving the safety of the facility and the surrounding community.  \n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas performs annual internal audits to ensure the site is following the procedures and policies delineated in the facility's PSM/RMP/CalARP programs and there is documentation to support program implementation.  These audits have resulted in recommendations to improve safety at the facility, and the facility has proceeded with addressing and implementing these recommendations.  The f"

      "SummaryText": "acility utilizes a tracking system to ensure the recommendations are addressed in a timely manner.  Below is a sample of action items identified from previous audits that have been completed to improve safety at the facility:\n\n\n\n1) Develop a method to ensure that the annual SOP review is documented using the SOP Review Certification Form.  Consider incorporating the form into Master Control.\n\nActions Taken: Matheson has begun utilizing a tracking system (Intelex) to ensure the annual SOP reviews are tracked/performed and documented.  Intelex sends a notification email to the Site Manager when the annual review is due.  The SOP review form has been incorporated into the corporate document control system (Master Control).  \n\n\n\n2) Develop a mechanism to ensure that refresher training on the work instructions is completed at least once every three years.\n\nActions Taken: Employee training records are reviewed during the annual CalARP audit.  The review is used to determine if the facility is soon due for the three-year refresher training and a recommendation is made to ensure training is completed.\n\n\n\n3) Revise the Incident Investigation program to include procedures for conducting investigations on chemical releases.  Ensure the program includes: 1) incident investigation team requirements, 2) definition of an RMP reportable incident, 3) ensuring the results of incident investigations are communicated to affected employees, and 4) retaining reports for at least five years.\n\nActions Taken: Included in the Incident Investigation section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP - Volume I binder are additional incident investigation requirements that need to be followed in conjunction with the corporate program.  These items have been incorporated into the requirements.\n\n\n\nAll recommendations from past audits and PHA studies, as well as their implementation status, are included in Intelex or the PSM/RMP/CalARP - Forms / Records Volume.\n\n"
