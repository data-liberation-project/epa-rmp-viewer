This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes and the fact that the Maysville Natural Gas Complex is currently an OSHA VPP Star Facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\t \n\nThe Texaco Maysville Natural Gas Complex, located in Maysville Oklahoma, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce Propane, Normal Butane, Isobutane, Ethane, Methane, and Gasoline Condensate petroleum products from natural gas. The Texaco Maysville Natural Gas Complex has regulated flammables, including:\nPropane\nNormal Butane\nIsobutane\nEthane\nMethane\nPentane\nIsoPentane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substance(s) at the Texaco Maysville Natural Gas Complex is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest inventory of Butane contained in a single storage tank. The maximum inventory in this storage tank is 2,100,000 pounds. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 1.0 mile. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Texaco Maysville natural Gas Complex is a vapor cloud e"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\nThe Texaco Maysville Natural Gas Complex uses hazard and operability studies (HAZOP's) which are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings are based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \nOperating Procedures\n \nThe Texaco Maysville Natural Gas Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n(1) Initial startup\n(2) normal startup\n(3) normal operations\n(4) temporary operations\n(5) consequences of deviation\n(6) normal shutdown\n(7) emergency shutdown\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \nTraining\n \nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Texaco Maysville Natural Gas Complex has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify/demonstrate (e.g., via performance review, skill demonstrations and written tests) that the operator understood the training.\n \nContractors\n \nThe Texaco Maysville Natural Gas Complex uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
