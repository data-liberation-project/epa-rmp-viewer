We operate our business in a manner that consciously safeguards our employees, customers and the communities in which we do business.  In striving for responsible environmental, health & safety (EH&S) stewardship, COP is committed to:\n*  Diligently develop, construct and operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes pollution prevention and places the highest priority on health and safety.\n*  Operate facilities that meet or exceed all applicable federal, state and local EH&S rules, regulations, ordinances and statues as well as recognized industry guidelines and standards.\n*  Continually measure, evaluate and improve our EH&S performance.\n*  Promote EH&S awareness that fosters a caring, ownership-driven culture among employees, contractors and vendors.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\nThe Sweeny Cogeneration Facility, located in Old Ocean, TX, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity and steam.  As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the four gas-fired combustion turbines, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in one dedicated, specially designed storage tank.  The storage tank is supplied with anhydrous ammonia on demand.  The storage capacity of the tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.  \n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis (OCA):\nPlease refer to OCA data located onsite at the Sweeny Cogeneration Facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility is subject to OSHA's PSM standard and Program 3 of EPA's RMP rule.

Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs.  Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis.  Sweeny Cogeneration employees are represented on the ConocoPhillips Refinery Employee Excellence Team which is involved in areas such as: employee behavior based safety process, safety standards and procedures review and updating, waste minimization programs, etc.  Employees have access to all information required under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI):\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  These documents include information concerning the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process technology, and process equipment.  PSI data is updated when changes in the process occur.  Information concerning the hazards of ammonia includes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical, reactivity, corrosivity, and thermal and stability data.\n\nInformation concerning the process technology includes process flow information, maximum intended inventory information, safe upper and lower process limits, and consequences of deviating from safe limits.\n\nInformation concerning the process equipment includes the materials of construction, piping specifications, piping and instrument diagrams, relief design calculations and design basis, design codes and standards employed, safety systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility conducts PHAs to help ensure that potential process hazards, including the ammonia process, are systematically identified and controlled.

The PHA process is managed by the ConocoPhillips Refinery PSM group, which has a formal system in place to ensure that any PHA recommendations are tracked and resolved in a timely manner.   \n\nOperating Procedures:\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal operations and temporary operations. The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations. Operating procedures are readily available to operations personnel.  Formal processes are established and maintained by the ConocoPhillips Refinery Training Team to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date.  In addition, safe work practices such as hot work, lockout/tagout and line breaking, are established and provided to help control potential hazards pertaining to this type of work.\n\nTraining:\nAll operations personnel of Sweeny Cogeneration Facility are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia process and the procedures required to safely operate the Cogen process. Operations personnel receive periodic refresher training to verify skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\nContractors:\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors will work on or near the ammonia process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are pre-qualified before performing work, aware of the hazards of the process, understand what to do in the event of an emer"

ConocoPhillips Refinery also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR):\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or significant facility modification. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental release prevention programs are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and emergency shutdown systems, in a safe operating condition. The program includes: (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identified equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.\n\nHot Work Permits:\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility utilizes a hot work permit program in place to ensure worker and process safety. The hot work permit program is designed to control heat and spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are\nin place before work begins in the process area.

The system requires that process safety information and operating procedures are updated and that operations and maintenance personnel are trained before the change is implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the release of ammonia. The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, are reviewed with all affected personnel (including contractors).\n\nCompliance Audits:\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, compliance audits are conducted every three years. A report of any findings from the compliance audits are documented by the audit team, and deficiencies are formally tracked to completion. The facility promptly addresses and resolves any deficiencies noted by the audit team. \n\nAdditional Safety Systems:\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, as well as systems to lessen the impact of accidental releases.  These systems include:\n*  Redundant instrumentation to monitor critical process parameters\n*  Redundant critical equipment\n*  Automated shutdown systems\n*  Pressure relief valves\n*  Water fogging system and manually operated water canon to wash ammonia vapors out of the air\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the plant in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nSweeny Cogeneration Facility utili"
