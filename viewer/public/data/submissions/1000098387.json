Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to Mustang Gas Products (MGP).  Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all MGP facilities.  Mustang Gas facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes/standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  MGP facilities are equipped with many engineering safeguards (i.e.: pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response.  This plan is provided to applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (i.e.:  police department, fire department, etc.).\n\n\n\n(b)    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.  The MGP liquids terminal is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.  The regulated substances at the facility include flammable chemical mixtures and individual chemicals.  Chemicals include natural gas liquids (NGL), an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture consisting of N-pentane, isopentane, N-butane, isobutane, propane, butane, methane and ethane.   The chemicals on site have an RMP regulated flammable mixture threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds or greater. \n\n\n\n(c)    Offsite Consequences Analysis.  MGP has performed offsite consequences analysis (OCA) including worst case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS) ranging from the catastrophic to more likely events.  Based on the results of these analyses, the number of potential receptors, if any, were identified.  To minimize offsite consequences, various administrative and mitigative (engineering) controls have been implemented/installed as safeguards to prevent deviations outside safe operating limits. "

    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 1000098387,
      "SummaryText": " Administrative controls include utilizing a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspect the facility.  Mitigative (engineering) safeguards include such things as high pressure/overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\n\n\n\n(d)    Hazard Communication Program.  MGP has developed and implemented a Hazard Communication Program that ensures:  1) an SDS is on file for all hazardous chemicals used or stored in the facility; 2) all applicable containers of hazardous chemicals are properly labeled/marked; and 3) employees receive annual training on the Company's Hazard Communication Program.\n\n\n\n(e)    Five Year Accident History.   This MGP facility has not had a regulated flammable chemical release in the previous five years.\n\n\n\n(f)    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  MGP is always looking for ways to improve their safety program.  The company believes the effectiveness of the safety program is directly proportional to employee involvement and senior management support.  Two tasks are being performed:  1) current training programs are being evaluated and 2) monthly safety inspection performed by the people who operate and maintain the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
