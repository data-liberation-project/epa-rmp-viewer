Members of management regularly attend and participate in the Pueblo County Local Emergency Planning Committee meetings.  We maintain written emergency preparedness plans that are regularly reviewed and updated as needed.  \n\nOur facility typically hosts open house every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  KMG makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation on many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility provides high purity chemicals to the semi-conductor industry.  The regulated substances handled are anhydrous ammonia, hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with written operating and maintenance procedures for the covered processes.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorou"

This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.  \n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThis facility began operation in 1998.  Since that time, we have not had a release of anhydrous ammonia, hydrochloric acid or ammonium hydroxide that resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact from our facility.  \n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees are trained and equipped to respond and neutralize releases of hazardous materials. Our employees regularly undergo extensive training in emergency response actions and methods.

This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews and process hazard analyses.  We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.
