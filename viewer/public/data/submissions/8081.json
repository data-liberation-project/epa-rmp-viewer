The general public would most likely encounter products made from these wafers in integrated circuits found in automobiles, pace makers, telecommunication equipment, and endless forms of electrical switches and controls, both consumer and industrial.   \n\nIn brief and greatly simplified, silicon wafers are made by a process in which crystal silicon ingots are polished to create a defect-free surface.  Then hydrogen chloride is introduced in the Epitaxail Silicon process as a wafer-cleaning agent, followed by trichlorosilane, which deposits another layer of silicon onto the wafer.\n\nIn response to the regulations enumerated by the Clean Air Act (CAA), as specified in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules on May 24, 1996, Sumitomo Sitix Silicon, Inc. submits its Risk Management Plan (RMP).  This RMP complies with the requirement to publish its plans to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to reduce the severity of the releases that do occur.  \n\nThe Process Safety Management team at Sumitomo Sitix Silicon (SSAC) has determined that the following chemicals and processes are subject to compliance with the EPA Risk Management Plan:\n\n7 Hydrogen chloride (HCl), bulk storage and delivery\n7 Trichlorosilane (TCS), bulk storage, delivery, and reclaim\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe prevention of accidental release of hazardous substances is of major concern for Sumitomo employees.  The objectives of SSAC's training programs are the preparation of employees to operate equipment properly and safely and to be alert to evidence of accidental chemical leaks and releases. \n\nEvery person working at Sumitomo Sitix Silicon, Inc.

As stated in Standard Operating Procedures 7501P, PSM-Process Safety Management Employee Participation Plan, \"Process safety is the responsibility of all employees that are involved with processes and systems that affect highly hazardous chemicals.\"  SSAC complies with all preventative safety programs as defined by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations.\n\nManagement is committed to employee safety and the implementation of safe procedures.  This is further demonstrated by the approval and support of various Standard Operating Procedures that proscribe specific safety practices, such as \"Hot Work,\" \"Evacuation Plans,\" and \"Lockout/Tagout of Hazardous Energies.\"\n\nManagement strongly supports the selection and training of the Employee Response Team (ERT), whose members are the first responders to any emergency incident.  First established in 1991, the ERT has been at the center of SSAC's emergency response programs.  \n\nSumitomo's Facility and On-site Regulated Substances\n\nThe EPA has designated hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane as regulated substances.  Regulated substances are defined as \"toxic and reactive highly hazardous chemicals that present a potential for a catastrophic event at or above a specified threshold quantity.\" \n\nSSAC maintains between 100,000 and 180,000 pounds of trichlorosilane on-site; 5,000 pounds is the threshold quantity.   This is distributed between two bulk tanks, two bubbler vessels, two condenser vessels, one reclaim TCS tank, and associated piping.  SSAC maintains between 20,000 to 42,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride on-site; 5,000 pounds is the threshold quantity. \n\nAs a consequence of these amounts of hazardous chemicals at its Maineville facility, SSAC has, over the past three years, conducted extensive process hazard assessment studies.  These ensure that rigorous safety standards are observed in all phases of its manufacturing oper"

The toxic cloud formed by the release of hydrogen chloride would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors. \n\n(1) Alternate-case release scenario for hydrogen chloride (anhydrous-Hydrochloric acid): If the transfer hose that connects the bulk HCl trailer manifold to the in-house HCl system were to fail, 940 pounds of hydrogen chloride vapor would be released.  Because of our rural location and the limited endpoint, the impact of such a release would affect only near-by offsite residences.  \n\nSSAC has taken these steps to make this alternate-case release unlikely: \n\n7 The transfer line is inspected and leak checked by the process chemical operator during daily rounds.\n7 The transfer line is replaced by a new line every six months.\n7 Chocks are placed under the HCl bulk trailer wheels to prevent accidental trailer movement.\n7 A process chemical operator is present to supervise the hook up of a new HCl bulk trailer and the release of a trailer after being emptied.\n\n(2) Alternate-case release scenario for hydrogen chloride (anhydrous-Hydrochloric acid): If there would be a leak in the HCl piping system, 164 pounds of hydrogen chloride vapor would be released.  Since this release is relatively small, this alternate-case scenario would not affect anyone outside our property.\n\nSSAC has taken these steps to make this alternate-case release unlikely: \n\n7 The HCl piping system is inspected and leak checked by the process chemical operator during daily rounds.\n7 The mechanical integrity of the HCl piping system is checked annually.\n7 The piping system is inspected for "

The Preventive Maintenance program, in conjunction with SSAC's Mechanical Integrity procedures, provides for continuous, regular inspection of the plant's physical equipment, and for replacement of equipment as necessary.\n\nFuture enhancements include improvements in engineering controls to limit the maximum flow of HCl that can flow through the HCl piping manifold.\n\nThe computer-based Preventive Maintenance (PM) program triggers the routine inspection of all regulated systems' equipment, including systems valves, gauges, flanges, piping supports, connectors, etc.  The PM program also schedules the replacement of specified components as determined by the life-expectancy of the particular component.  \n\nSSAC maintains a c"
