Foods, utilize anhydrous ammonia in a closed-circuit refrigeration system. O.K. Foods established; programs, procedures and safety devices to prevent exposure to personnel, community and surrounding environment also protect property assets. Policies have been created to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations. O.K. Foods strives to prevent potential releases through continual, training and evaluation of policies, programs and procedures.  \n\n\n\nEmergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies. Working in conjunction with the Fort Smith Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is the processing of poultry products. Utilizing one regulated substance above the threshold level:  anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing. An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units. Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\n\n\nO.K. Foods has three independent systems at this site. The largest and only 'covered' process contains 81,078 pounds of ammonia.  The total amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 92,761 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3.

O.K. Foods has determined that the Plant 2 receiver to be the source of the worst-case release.  The actual largest vessel is the 34,000-lb intercooler.  However, this vessel is liquid by refrigeration under vacuum and is located indoors.
