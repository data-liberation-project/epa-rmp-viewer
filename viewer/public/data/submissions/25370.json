The Cinergy East Bend Plant is a coal-fired, electric power generating facility located in Rabbit Hash, Kentucky.  The Plant uses anhydrous ammonia in its SCR system to control nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, an air pollutant.  The SCR system is designed to inject ammonia gas into the Plant flue gas and then pass the ammonia/flue gas mixture over a catalyst.  The catalyst causes a reaction that reduces NOx (pollutant) emissions in the flue gas, converting NOx into nitrogen gas and water.  The East Bend Plant stores the anhydrous ammonia in a 40,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  ANSI Code requires that this tank be filled to 87.5% capacity (35,000 gallons) or less.  The anhydrous ammonia in the storage tank is liquefied under pressure.  The ammonia storage and handling system was designed to current engineering standards and codes to ensure safety.  The design includes safety features such as a dike designed to contain 110% of the inventory of the tank, emergency shutdown systems, excess flow valves and process area ammonia detectors.  .\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies and programs:  The East Bend Plant has established an Accidental Release Prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with the regulatory requirements of both OSHA (Process Safety Management, PSM, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA (Risk Management Program, RMP, 40 CFR 68).  In addition, for responding to potential emergencies the Plant has coordinated with the local emergency responder -  Boone County Emergency Management - and established an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for evacuation of employees.   The EAP complies with OSHA  requirements (29 CFR 1910.38).  The Station's plans have also been coordinated with the Local Emergen"

      "SummaryText": "cy Planning Committee (LEPC). \n\nAccident history and recent changes to improve safety: Since the process is newly constructed, there is no accident history.  However, to ensure a safe process, a HAZOP was conducted.  The HAZOP identified several minor design and operating changes that enhanced process safety.  The changes were implemented prior to arrival of ammonia.\n\nThe worst-case (and alternative) release scenarios: One worst-case release scenario and an alternate scenario were developed and modeled in accordance with EPA's RMP regulations.  The Process Hazard Analysis Software Tools (PHAST) program - an EPA approved model -  was used to conduct the dispersion modeling.  The worst-case scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The scenario used for this analysis was a tank rupture in which the total quantity in the tank is completely released over a 10-minute period.  The model predicted a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.5 miles, which is based on a number of conservative assumptions set forth by the EPA such as F-class stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and the highest recorded temperature over the past three years (105 degrees F).  Population information obtained through the \"EPA Geographic Query Information System (Version 97.1.8)\" show that approximately 220 people live within 1.5 miles of the storage tanks.                                                                                                                \n\nThe alternate scenario involved an ammonia release from a drain valve that is left open on a forwarding pump.   For this scenario the PHAST model predicts a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.29 miles.  Population information obtained indicates there is an estimated population of 0 located within 0.29 miles of the storage tanks.  No environmental receptors were identified within 0.29 miles of the sto"
