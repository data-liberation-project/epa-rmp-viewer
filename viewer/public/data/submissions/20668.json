If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\nThe primary activity at the facility is storage and sales to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed.  The maximum quantity stored would be 140,200 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.  The Worst-case and Alternative Release scenario.\n\na.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over a 10 minute period. The maximum quantity release would be 140,200 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 87 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a relief valve.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .1 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  The Five year Accident history\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program \n\nAtkinson Farm Service has:\n\na.  an"

We conduct yearly safety meetings, safety equipment checks, and check emergency spill equipment procedures.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time."
