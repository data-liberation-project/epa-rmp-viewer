The required elements of the RMP prevention program are listed below:\r\n\r\n- Employee Participation\r\n- Process Safety Information\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\n- Training\r\n- Contractors\r\n- Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n- Mechanical Integrity\r\n- Hot Work Permit\r\n- Management of Change (MOC)\r\n- Incident Investigation\r\n- Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nIn addition, the facility meets the requirements of the RMP Emergency Planning and Response element as detailed below. These items, their specific requirements, and how the Engie - University of Iowa Water Plant complies with the requirements are addressed in the individual procedural documents. \r\n\r\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\r\n\r\nDue to stringent release prevention policies at the facility, the ENGIE - University of Iowa Water Plant has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\r\n\r\nThe ENGIE - University of Iowa Water Plant is included in the written community emergency response plan. The agency coordinating the community emergency response plan is the Iowa City Fire Department, which has the phone number 319-356-5260.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\r\nThe ENGIE - University of Iowa Water Plant utilizes PHAs, PSSRs, MOCs, Incident Investigations, and Compliance Audits as part of the ongoing RMP. Recommendations from these RMP program elements are used to identify and implement changes to improve safety at the site."

The ENGIE - University of Iowa Water Plant is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.  \r\n\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\r\nStationary Source:\r\n\r\nThe ENGIE - University of Iowa Water Plant functions as both a water source for the University of Iowa campus, hospitals and clinics, dorms and student/staff housing and as a research facility for advanced study in Environmental Engineering. ENGIE - University of Iowa is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by their comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. ENGIE - University of Iowa implements appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\r\n\r\nThe ENGIE - University of Iowa Water Plant uses one chemical that is subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This chemical is chlorine.  It is a necessary material used in water treatment.\r\n \r\nThe chlorine process includes unloading and storage of chlorine cylinder"
