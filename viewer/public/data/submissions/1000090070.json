The ENGIE - University of Iowa Water Plant is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nStationary Source:\n\n\n\nThe ENGIE - University of Iowa Water Plant functions as both a water source for the University of Iowa campus, hospitals and clinics, dorms and student/staff housing and as a research facility for advanced study in Environmental Engineering. ENGIE - University of Iowa is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by their comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. ENGIE - University of Iowa implements appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\n\n\n\nThe ENGIE - University of Iowa Water Plant uses one chemical that is subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This chemical is chlorine.  It is a necessary material used in water treatment.\n\n \n\nThe chlorine process includes unloading and storage of chlorine cylinder"
