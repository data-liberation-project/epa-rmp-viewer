R. Simplot Company to manufacture, handle, transport, store and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state and local environmental laws while reducing the risks to human health, safety and the environment.\u00bf \n\nThe J.R. Simplot Company, Helm, California, is committed to being a responsible community partner. Training in emergency procedures is current and ongoing.  Every effort is made to prevent accidental releases and, in the very unlikely event of a release, to be prepared to keep offsite consequences to a minimum.  The Mid-Valley Fire District and the Fresno County Health Department are informed of all substances manufactured, stored, and handled at this facility and we fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from the regulatory community. \n\nb)\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe J. R. Simplot Company, Helm facility produces fertilizer and industrial chemicals. Three of the chemicals listed in 40 CFR 68.130, anhydrous ammonia, 98 % nitric acid and butane, are processed, stored, and handled in quantities exceeding threshold limits for this report.\n\nc)\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTwo dispersion scenarios were modeled for all three chemicals under the regulation: one to show the EPA-required scenario called the \u00bfworst-case,\u00bf and one \u00bfalternate-case\u00bf scenario that depicts a more credible possible incident and how it could affect the surrounding area.  \n\nThe \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario for anhydrous ammonia is based on a 10-minute gas"

      "SummaryText": "release of 85 tons from the largest vessel and allows for no active mitigation. This EPA-required scenario is comparable to an airplane falling out of the sky and landing directly on an ammonia storage tank.  Administrative controls limit storage to 85 % of maximum capacity.  Air dispersion modeling suggests off-site consequences for this scenario.  \n\nA more credible release could occur if a hose ruptured or came uncoupled while unloading a truck of anhydrous ammonia.  This scenario is used for the \u00bfalternate scenario\u00bf for anhydrous ammonia as required by section 112(r).  Administrative controls are in place to prevent this occurrence.  In addition, active mitigation measures consisting of check valves, excess flow valves, and emergency shut-off valves are in place to mitigate consequences.  Air dispersion modeling suggests that this scenario could potentially release 35,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia if active mitigation measures fail.  An unmitigated release has the potential for off-site consequences.  With the wind coming from the north-west which is common for the area, the vapor would disperse over an empty field before reaching a populated area.\n\nThe \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario for 98 % nitric acid assumes that 100 tons (the entire contents of one rail car) are spilled forming a pool 1 cm deep.  No passive mitigation systems are in place.  Air dispersion modeling indicates that 67,000 lbs could be released to the air over 40 minutes.  The \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario has off-site consequences.\n\nThe \u00bfalternate-case\u00bf for 98 % nitric acid considers a scenario where an operator tries to pull the 98 % rail car from the loadout rack while it is being unloaded.  Although administrative controls are in place to prevent such an occurrence, it is the most probable scenario for a large scale 98 % nitric acid release.  Air dispersion modeling indicates 3,100 lbs of nitric acid could be released to the air (if active mitigation measures fail) over 34 minutes resulting in no off-site co"

An event that could cause this type of incident would be on the order of a meteor falling directly onto the tank.  Administrative controls limit the storage to 90 % of maximum capacity.  No passive mitigation systems are in place. The \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario has no off-site receptors as a result of the vapor cloud explosion.  However, a release similar to that of the worst case for 98 % nitric acid could occur since the 98 % nitric acid rail car is unloaded in the vulnerable zone for this type of vapor cloud explosion.\n\nThe \u00bfalternate case\u00bf for butane considers a scenario where a truck driver pulls away from the unloading rack while the hoses are still connected.  Although administrative controls, check valves, excess flow valves, and break-away nipples are in place to prevent and mitigate this kind of occurrence, it is still the most likely scenario that a large scale release could occur.  No passive mitigation systems are in place.  Modeling results show that if active mitigation measures fail, 35,000 lbs of butane could be released resulting in a potential fireball.  This scenario has no off-site receptors.\n\nd)\tThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nAll employees assigned to work in the areas where ammonia, 98 % nitric acid, and butane are handled are trained in the safe handling of these materials. Employees receive initial training appropriate to the job when hired or when re-assigned.  Periodic training is conducted for such things as operating procedures, emergency procedures, chemical hazards, lock-out/tag-out, mechanical integrity, methods to avoid accidental releases, etc. \n\n \nIn addition to training, the following precautions are taken in areas where ammonia, butane, and 98 % nitric acid are handled:"
