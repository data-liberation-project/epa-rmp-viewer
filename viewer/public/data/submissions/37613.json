In this way we promote plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nAtlas Cold Storage provides refrigerated warehouse storage to the public.  Anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) is used as the refrigerant fluid.  Atlas Cold Storage is subject to the EPA RM program because its refrigeration system contains more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nAtlas Cold Storage's accidental release prevention program includes a process hazards analysis for the ammonia refrigeration system, development and implementation of standard"
