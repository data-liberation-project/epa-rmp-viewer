FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n   A. THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n   B. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR APPLICATION ON CROPS AS FERTILIZER NUTRIENT.\n\n   C. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE WOULD BE 204,528 POUNDS. NURSE TANKS WOULD CONTAIN 125,528 POUNDS AND 79,000 POUNDS IN AN 18,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. *NOTE: MAXIMUM QUANTITY ALLOWED TO BE STORED IS 85% OF STORAGE TANK SIZE.\n\nIII. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n   A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF THE STORAGE TANK OVER A 10 MINUTE TIME SPAN. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 79,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE TOXIC ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.83 MILES. \n\n   B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE TOXIC ENDPOINT IS 0.59 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE, PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n   A. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE INC.\n\n   B.
