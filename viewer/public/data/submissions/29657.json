American Gypsum stores more than the threshold quantity of propane (10,000 pounds) for use as fuel at an industrial facility.  Therefore, American Gypsum is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in 40 CFR 68.150.\n\nAmerican Gypsum is committed to operating in a safe and compliant manner. Employees involved in operating the propane storage facility are thoroughly trained to identify and understand the hazards posed by this the transfer process.  Process safety and emergency response materials are kept on site and periodically reviewed.  Information includes information pertaining to the hazards of propane, process technology, process equipment, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe stationary source is the propane storage facility.  The largest propane process group (e.g., storage tank or group of interconnected tanks) has a storage capacity of 30,000 water gallons (110,000 pounds).  The total propane \nstationary storage capacity is 220,000 pounds.\n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario \nper hazardous substance handled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program \napplicability.  American Gypsum has chosen to use the Vapor Cloud Explosion (TNT) model to determine offsite impacts.  For this facility, a worst-case \nrelease would occur in the event that the largest propane storage \ntank(s) would rupture and the entire contents would be released to the \natmosphere in 10 minutes.\n\nResults of Worst-Case Pr"

The rule \ndefines the explosive endpoint of propane to be 1 psi overpressure.  \nThe residential population within a 0.39 mile radius of the facility is \n6 based on the 2000 US Census data.\n\nThe facility is required to complete one alternate release scenario per \nregulated chemical per 40 CFR Part 68.165(a)(2).  The alternative \nrelease scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines \nprovided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\n\nThe alternative scenarios chosen for this facility involves a release \nbecause of a sudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this \nscenario is still unlikely because the transfer hoses used have \nmultiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless steel wire \nunderneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it \nis more likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  \nThis scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor \nline to the tank truck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture \narea is assumed at 0.5 square inches.  Because personnel are always \npresent at the facility during transfer, Battle Creek Co-op personnel \nwill respond within 10 minutes.  Release rate was calculated using the \nOCAG tank release equation (Section 8.1.1).\n\nResults of Propane Alternative Release Scenario\n\nInput of the preceding data into the RMP Comp program, the results \nindicate an alternate case impact of 0.08 miles for the facility.  The \nresidential population within this radius is 0.\n \nThe facility maintains written process safety information to enable \nemployees involved in handling propane to identify and understand the \nhazards posed by this process.
