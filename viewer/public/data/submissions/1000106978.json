      "SummaryText": "Energy Transfer LP\nRed Lake Gas Plant\nStanton, Texas\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR \nTHE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMPlan)\n\nIntroduction and Policies\nEnergy Transfer LP is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  Energy Transfer\u0092s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency planning and response activities in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and continuous improvement efforts to improve safety at the facility.\nThis submission is being sent to EPA as required by 40 CFR 68.190(b)(5), which requires an RMP update due to a revised hazard review.  The revised hazard review incorporates Train 2 into the Train 1 hazard review.\nNon-Responding Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nEnergy Transfer owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located near Stanton, Texas.  The Red Lake Gas Plant treats and dehydrates natural gas to produce residue gas (methane) and natural gas liquids (NGL).  After processing, the residue gas and NGL exit the plant via product pipelines. \nThe incoming raw field gas/hydrocarbon liquids mixture enters the facility and flows into a slug catcher.  Gas exits the slug catcher and is routed to a three-phase separator.  The gas is then treated to remove hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), water, and excess nitrogen before being sent to the cryogenic processing unit.  In the cryogenic unit, sub-zero temperatures separate the natu"

The chilled dehydrated gas is then sent to a demethanizer tower where it is separated into the residue gas product stream and the NGL product stream.  Both products leave the facility via pipeline.\nHydrocarbon liquids from the slug catcher and the three-phase separator are routed to a stabilizer.  In the stabilizer, water, light-end vapors, and other impurities are removed.  Natural gas liquids are then routed to the liquid amine treater where H2S and CO2 are removed.  The treated NGL leaves the facility via pipeline.\nWaste gas (H2S and CO2) are routed to a thermal oxidizer.  Condensate and wastewater (slop) from the various process separators, dehydration unit, cryogenic unit, and scrubbers are routed to storage tanks.  Condensate and slop are periodically loaded into tank trucks for outside sales and/or disposal.\nThe RMP flammable substances and mixtures stored or processed at the facility are the flammable mixture comprised of methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane, and pentane, which is being processed through the plant; as well as propane, which is used as refrigerant in the cryogenic process. There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  Hydrogen sulfide, the only RMP toxic substance found in the process, is stored in quantities far below the RMP threshold quantity (documentation of amounts stored is found in the documentation section of the RMP binder).  \nEnergy Transfer has determined that the gas plant should be considered one process under the RMP rule.  This facility has one process (as defined by the regulation) consisting of a flammable mixture and propane.  Although the systems containing the flammable mixture and the propane are not interconnected, an incident in one of the systems could trigger a release in the other system, therefore, the two systems should be considered one proces"

As required by the RMP rule for Program Level 1 facilities, response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies.  \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency planning and response programs in place at the facility include:\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility, operator training, and intervention.\nPrevention Program\nThe Red Lake Gas Plant is operating under a prevention program that involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this Program Level 1 facility include:\n-\tProviding overpressure relief valves on pressurized vessels.\n-\tProviding level transmitters and alarms on vessels to help prevent overfilling.\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a continuous flare.\n-\tProviding automated and manual valves to isolate portions of the process.\n-\tInstalling hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the gas plant to alarm personnel of a possible explosive environment.\n-\tInstalling fire eye detectors throughout the gas plant to alarm personnel of a possible fire.\n-\tInstalling security"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility will be the Martin County Sheriff\u0092s Department.  The Plant Management is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions when an incident occurs within the facility.  An emergency response program is in place at the facility and that program has been coordinated with local officials.  The Red Lake Gas Plant is designated as a non-responding stationary source.

This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance safe work practices are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent recurrence of the incident.\n-\tInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements with any action items tracked to completion.\n-\tAn ongoing dialogue with the Martin County LEPC and the Martin County Volunteer Fire Department will ensure a readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well to implement improvements as the need develops."
