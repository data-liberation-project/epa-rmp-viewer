      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChemron, a Lubrizol Company, is a manufacturing company for surfactants, with facilities in Bowling Green, Ohio and Paso Robles, California.  Gene Iaquinta is president of Chemron and Michael McCluskey is the Director of Operations.  Dennis Callan is plant manager of the Bowling Green plant,. \n\nThe Bowling Green site consists of approximately 14 acres of land located at 1142 N Main Street in the city of Bowling Green, Wood County, Ohio.  The site is occupied by and office and manufacturing facility under one roof, several smaller buildings which house equipment, and a warehouse building.  There are several outside storage tanks.  A water retention pond at the front of the property on Main Street contains storm water runoff.  Paved parking areas and drives serve the structures.  Surrounding land use is primarily commercial and industrial, with limited residential properties located directly on the southern border of the subject site.  \n\nChemron produces a variety of surfactants and related products, including organic sulfates, organic amides, and betaines.  Many of the products are blends of various surfactants and additives.  Byproducts include muriatic acid and methanol.  The products from Chemron are used in blends for commercial detergents, shampoos, and cosmetic products.  Products are shipped by tanker truck or by drum.  Most products are liquid with a very few being solid.  \n\nEpichlorohydrin will be stored inside the plant in the Hazardous Materials storage area, Building 5d.  This area is located in the main building housing the production and office areas of the facility.  The  Hazardous Materials  storage area is equipped with a sprinkler system as is all of the building area within the main facility.  Primary containment systems within the interior of the building include a floor drain system.\n\nChemicals used in the plant are managed carefully by all personnel to avoid releases.  Both the production and maintenance teams consider process"

      "SummaryText": "safety and personnel protection with the highest priority.  .  The Maintenance Manager also serves as the Safety Manager at the Chemron Bowling Green Plant.  The Safety Manager directs the activities of the Safety Lead who has the day to day safety responsibilities.  Assistance in safety planning is available from both the Lubrizol (Wickliffe, Ohio) corporate headquarters and the Chemron (Paso Robles, California) subsidiary headquarters.  Hazardous operations review and planning is performed by a plant team consisting of plant management, environmental management, and plant operations and maintenance personnel for chemicals of concern such as flammables, toxics or otherwise dangerous chemicals.  The plant does not currently fall under the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations.  \n\nThe Plant Manager, Mr. Dennis Callan, is an active participant in local government organizations and industry associations dealing with safe chemical use, including the following member affiliations:\n\nWood County Local Emergency Planning Committee (voting member)  \nBowling Green Community Economic \nDevelopment Foundation\nBowling Green Chamber of Commerce\nNorthwest Ohio Chemical and Allied Industries Group\n\nChemron personnel in leadership roles receive Technician-Level Emergency Response training designed to meet OSHA Hazard Communication Standard training requirements promulgated in 29 CFR 1910.120.  Personnel also receive Hazardous Materials training specific to the chemicals being stored and used on site. . \n\n\nSpill response equipment, including absorbents, protective equipment, and empty recovery/salvage drums, is stored in various areas of the plant.  Upon the receipt of EHS and selected hazardous materials in packages, emergency response equipment is relocated to the receiving area.  Additional spill response reclamation drums are stored in the building 5a.  Materials Safety Data Sheets are located in the employee lunch room, filed in several ways for easy use.

      "SummaryText": "rgency response plan is also in this location. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is assigned to each employee with additional PPE available in the lunchroom located in building 5b.\n\nThe process to manufacture sulfobetaine (Tradename Chembetaine CAS) is covered by Program Level 1 due to the raw material, epichlorohydrin, used in its manufacture.  Epichlorohydrin is stored in 55-gallon drums, four drums to a pallet stacked single high.  Warehousing quantities are not anticipated to exceed 120 drums, or 60,840 pounds at any given time. Product shipments are delivered in 80-unit lots.  A member of the plant management team, the Hazardous Materials Supervisor, oversees the receipt of epichlorohydrin as well as other hazardous materials.  The unloading area has containment and a trench drain large enough to capture the contents of at least one full drum. During unloading operations, the emergency spill mitigation cart is re-located to the receiving area.  An external drum sealing device is part of the contents of this cart.  \n\nThe worst case scenario was considered to be damage to a drum by a forklift resulting in the complete loss of the contents of the drum to the surroundings. If the event occurs in the truck unloading area, which is the most probable case, all the epichlorohydrin is contained within a trench designed to mitigate such a spill. The trench system was considered as passive mitigation in the modeling release scenario.  A commercial program was used to model this spill, and the heavy gas model Degadis was used to predict the worst case offsite consequence.  In this case, there was no off-site consequence and the toxic endpoint limit of 76 mg/m3 epichlorohydrin was not reached on site.  No alternate scenario was considered.  \n\nThere is a plant emergency response plan.  The MSDS requirements are met, and the SARA 312 Tier II hazardous communications regulations are followed.  The plant also falls under the SARA 313 Toxic Release Inventory regulations.  Th"

There are no existing risk management covered chemicals at this time.  Epichlorohydrin will be the first chemical to exceed the threshold,  requiring a Risk Management Plan. \n\nEmergency response procedures are discussed in the Emergency Response Plan for the site."
