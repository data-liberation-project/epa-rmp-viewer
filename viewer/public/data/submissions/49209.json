      "SummaryText": "Ameren Energy Newton Plant\n\nThe Ameren Energy Generating Newton Plant is located on Newton Lake in Jasper County, Illinois, approximately 8 miles southwest of the city of Newton.  Newton Plant began producing electricity in 1977.\n\nOne-ton cylinders connected to a common header feed system have been safely used at the Newton Plant for the past 27 years.   There have been no significant injuries or releases of chlorine during the entire operating period.\n\nThe plant typically uses 12 tons of chlorine each year to prevent biofouling of equipment associated with the water treatment plant.  Chlorine is continuously added to the feed water for the water treatment plant which produces ultra pure water for boiler makeup.  The system is equpped with chlorine leak detection monitors, and leak checks are performed during routine maintenance.  The chlorine cylinders are located on the east side of the water treatment plant which is along a frequently traveled plant road.  This location enables both Operations and Maintenance personnel to quickly detect any abnormal conditions.  The water treatment plant chlorine injection system is a vacuum-induced flow through a regulator and v-notch flow controller.  If the vacuum is lost, the regulator will close, and the feed for the injection system will be shut off.  Additionally, there is a chlorine gas detector located near the chlorine cylinders to detect any leakage from the cylinders or associated piping.  If this sensor detects the presence of chlorine gas, an alarm will sound in the Water Treatment Plant and in the main control room of the generating plant.\n\nThe plant did also use chlorine in the Screen House to chlorinate non-contact cooling water to prevent biofouling of the plant condensers and heat exchangers.  This system was removed from service in January 2007 which is the reason for submitting this RMP Submit update.\n\nThe importance of preventing any releases is stressed through on-the-job training for employees entering job"
