The Terra Donaldsonville manufacturing plant is temporarily idled due to market conditions and is operating as an ammonia terminal for purposes of the RMP.  When the manufacturing status of the facility changes, the RMP will be revised accordingly.\n\nTerra and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety, and the environment.  In order to document that commitment, Terra's Management has authorized a Health, Safety and Environmental Statement of Policy.  This policy is summarized below.\n\nLaws, rules and regulations in the area of health, safety, and the environment impose responsibilities on the Company and its employees.  An additional purpose of this policy is to set forth the principles under which those responsibilities are to be fulfilled, thereby providing appropriate protection for employees, as well as the Company.\n\nEmployee Health and Safety\nWorkplace health and safety are paramount concern.  The Company and its employees are expected to be aware of and adhere to laws, regulations, Company policy and procedures designed to ensure safe and healthy workplace conditions and practices.\n\nContractors and Visitor Health and Safety\nAll contractors working in the Company's facilities or visitors to Company's facilities are expected to be aware of and adhere to all Company health, safety, and environmental policies and procedures.

In the production of ammonia, Terra uses natural gas, air and water as feedstocks.  The feedstocks are heated to a point that they are broken down into nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide.  This is in the gas state.  The carbon dioxide is then removed from the gas stream as a by-product, and only nitrogen and hydrogen remain in the gas stream.  The hydrogen and nitrogen is then bonded together to form ammonia (NH3).  The ammonia is then cooled to form a liquid at -28 degrees F.  The ammonia is sent to two 30,000 ton storage tanks.  \n\nAs previously discussed, Terra's commitment to safety and the environment takes priority.  Terra's safety and environmental record reflects this commitment.  The following is a summary of the multiple layers of safety and environmental protection that Terra has in place at our plants to protect our employees and the community.\n\n*Managing risks is something we do on a daily basis.\n\n*We have worked for many years to reduce risks to our site and to be prepared for emergencies.\n\n*Our employees ar"

The releases that Terra has had in the past five years are typically very small in nature to the air and do not meet the criteria that is stipulated in the regulations.\n\nTerra has an extensive emergency response program both within the facility and within the community.  Within the facility there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with.  The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance.  The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, civil strife, area risks from outside the facility, personnel injury or fatality, and equipment failures.  The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that each person is required to have depending on their responsibilities.

All these plans are reviewed with representatives of the LEPC, State Police, Sheriff's Department, Fire Departments, regulatory agencies and industry.\n\nTerra is striving on a daily basis to try and make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  Terra literally has safety and/or environmental training going on almost daily; every employee and contractor will attend several safety and/or environmental training meetings annually.  Terra and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety, and the environmental, and our success is accomplished by research, innovation and the use of good common sense."
