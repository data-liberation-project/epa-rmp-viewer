The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 2452 N Bader Road, is the storage \nof fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 1-12,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, \nassociated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 210,000 \npounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse \ntanks.\n\nAqua ammonia is stored, and distributed for application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of storage tanks, mixers, loading riser and associated plumbing.  Acess to the site is restricted to authoried employees, authorized management personnl and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quanity of aqua ammonia that can be stored would be 190,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage \ntank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released \nwould be 56,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank \nas limited by design standards.  \n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for th"
