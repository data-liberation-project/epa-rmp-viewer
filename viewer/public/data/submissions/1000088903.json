Lengths of lines and volumes of certain vessels\n\nwere assumed based on good engineering practices. A table of inventory is shown in Appendix\n\n1. Only administrative controls can be credited when limiting volumes in vessels per the General\n\nGuidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68)\n\nchapter 4.2. In order to establish the safest possible environment for EnLink's employees and the\n\npublic, there are no regulated toxic substances above threshold quantities present at the Riptide\n\nGas Plant.\n\nApplicability of Program Levels\n\nLocation of facility\n\nEnLink Midstream Partners operates the Riptide Gas Plant in Martin County, Texas. The facility\n\nis located approximately 4.51 miles southwest of Lenorah, Texas. Its coordinates are\n\n32.24305?N, -101.90355?W. The address for the facility is 3014 FM 829 Lenorah, TX 79749.\n\nThe facility is surrounded by undeveloped land. Tarzan is approximately 6.03 miles northwest of\n\nthe facility and Stanton is approximately 10.34 miles southeast of the facility.

The following worst-case scenarios were analyzed:\n\n&#10146; Flammable Mixture - Slug Catcher, SC-100 failure - 784,000 lbs.\n\n&#10146; Propane - Refrigerant Accumulator, V-463 failure - 18,600 lbs.\n\nEPA's program yielded the following endpoint for each regulated substance:\n\n&#10146; Flammable Mixture - 0.7 miles\n\n&#10146; Propane - 0.2 miles\n\nThe closest public receptor is approximately 3,827 ft. (0.72 miles) from the vessels in the\n\nanalysis.\n\nAccording to EnLink personnel, the Riptide Gas Plant has had no accidents in the last five years;\n\ntherefore the accident history has no bearing on the program determination.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-case Case Scenarios\n\nThe EPA program \"RMP*COMP\" ver. 2.01 was used to determine the vapor cloud explosion\n\nendpoints to 1 psi overpressure for the \"worst-case\" scenario.

A\n\nworst-case scenario considers the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a\n\nvessel or process line failure that results in the greatest affected distance. Since the Riptide Gas\n\nPlant is considered a Program 1 facility, a worst-case scenario for each regulated substance, i.e.\n\nFlammable Mixture and Propane must be considered. The specifics of each worst-case scenario\n\ncan be seen in Appendix 4.\n\nSince this facility was determined to be a Program 1 process, no alternative scenarios were\n\nconsidered.\n\nThe selected worst-case scenario for the Riptide Gas Plant is a release from the Slug Catcher,\n\nSC-100 releasing approximately 784,000 lbs. of a Flammable Mixture. The endpoint to 1 psi of\n\noverpressure for this scenario is 0.7 miles and is the greatest endpoint of all worst-case scenarios\n\nconsidered for each regulated substance at the facility.

The plant consists of the following: inlet\n\ngas separation and filtration, condensate stabilization, inlet compression, amine treatment unit,\n\ndehydration, cryogenic processing unit, refrigeration system, residue compression, flare system,\n\nand all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in\n\nseven 750-barrel atmospheric tanks located within secondary containment areas and loaded into\n\ntanker trucks for shipment.

The Ripley Compressor\n\nStation is currently being built and will be installed within the facility boundary of the Riptide\n\nGas Plant. The station will be receiving approximately 20 MMSCFD of natural gas from Pioneer\n\nNatural Resources.
