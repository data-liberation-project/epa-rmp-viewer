              "Description": "VWR has compiled information that is necessary for safe handling and storage of regulate chemical products.  This information includes:\n\n\n?    Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) for each regulated chemical.  This information is available electronically. \n?    Maximum intended inventory of equipment in which regulated chemicals are stored.  The maximum intended container size for chloroform is 55 gallons.  The estimated maximum inventory of chloroform is estimated at 35,000 lbs;\n?    Acceptable storage temperatures and conditions. ;\n?    Equipment use and maintenance specifications (Use and maintenance specifications for forklifts, storage rack, and other equipment are maintained on file at the facility.)  VWR uses internal SOPs and scedules to cover  the preventative maintenance procedures for equipment involved in the receipt, warehousing, transport and storage of regulated chemical materials;\n?     Codes and standards used to design and build the facility. National Fire Protection Association [NFPA] 30 A? Flammable and Combustible Liquids; NFPA231 A? Standard for General Storage; and NFPA 231[c] Standard for Rack Storage of Materials.\n\n\nHazard Review\n\nThe hazard associated with the regulated chemicals is:\n\n?    Toxicity\n\nVWR periodically reviews and audits its operations to identify and control potential hazards.  The original hazard review was completed June 21, 1999.  On Feb 8, 2008, the hazard review was updated as a result of NJ DEP recommendations and the predictive filing of chloroform .  The review updated upon the 1993 What-If Analysis conducted in a prior TCPA submission, and utilized the Chemical Manufacturer AssociationA?s Warehouse Assessment Protocol as an additional guide for further hazard review.  The Warehouse Assessment Protocol document is cited, in EPAA?s guidance document Risk Management Program for Warehouses (40 CFR Part 68, as providing a suitable framework for conducting a hazard review.  Additionally, facility personnel and other persons familiar with warehouse operations provided input to the hazard review process.\n\nCurrent facility management practices were deemed appropriate to prevent a toxic release.  For example, the existence of standard operating procedures and training programs help minimize the risk of human error associated with facility operations.  Similarly, daily inspection of forklifts and the use of a standard checklist, help ensure that forklifts do not fail while in use.  \n\nIf a chemical release were to occur, it would first be detected by an operator, either visually or by odor.  Once detected, the facility has direct-reading colorimetric detection equipment that can determine the concentration of the chemical in air (measured in parts per million, or percent).\n\nMitigation systems and equipment are available for use by trained VWR emergency response personnel, in the event of a release.  Toxic substances can be absorbed and containerized for later disposal.  Mitigation systems for a fire or explosion include a system of sprinklers, dikes, fire walls, and blast walls.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nVWR maintains written procedures for most operations.  Refer to Appendix C for procedures relating to normal start-up and routine operations.  Refer to section 2 for procedures relating to emergency shut-down, evacuation and emergency operations, and start-up following an emergency shut-down.  The issuance or revision date is shown on procedures to indicate the date of last review.\n\n\nTraining\n\nVWR provides employee training for routine operations and emergency situations.  The training process can include one or more instructional formats, such as: lecture; videotape; interactive computer-based training, hands-on exercises, demonstrations and on the job training.  Training is conducted by a qualified instructor or other competent person.  Employee proficiency may be evaluated using one or more techniques, including classroom quiz, actual demonstration, or verbal assessment.\n\nNew employees and employees who are transferred to new responsibilities receive training prior to starting the job.  This ensures that all employees understand and can perform their duties in accordance with operating procedures.\n\nEmployees will be re-trained whenever operating procedures are revised, and at least once every three years, even if procedures have not changed.  \n\nFor administrative efficiency, training under this section may be combined with any other employee training provided by VWR.\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nVWR maintains a list of process equipment that requires routine inspection and maintenance.  There are written procedures relating to inspection and maintenance requirements.  Personnel responsible for inspection and maintenance are trained on these procedures.  The procedures are typically developed by VWR or are obtained from equipment manufacturers.   A list of Standard Operating Procedures and Preventative Maintenance Procedures relevant to this plan are maintained onsite in the company intranet.\n\nIn order to prevent overdue preventative maintenance inspections, the facility manager maintains an electronic documentation which list recurring maintenance schedule which is reviewed at least monthly.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nVWR will conduct an audit at least once every three (3) years to evaluate compliance with Prevention Program requirements.  An  audit was completed and a Triennial Report submitted on February 6-8 2008.  Findings and recommended corrective actions were put in writing, and corrective actions were addressed .  Upon completion of corrective actions VWR provided a written certification that the compliance evaluations have been completed.  All written records relating to compliance audits will be retained for at least (5) five years.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nVWRA?s emergency procedures include a provision for conducting an investigation and analysis of each incident in which the emergency plan is activated.  Because VWR investigates all incidents, this procedure satisfies the requirement that VWR investigate each incident that A?resulted in, or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.A?  \n\nEach EHS accident or potential catastrophic event will be investigated promptly, and in no case later than 48 hours following the incident.  The incident investigation report and reports of corrective actions will be put in writing.  At a minimum, a summary shall be prepared including the following elements:\n?    A description of the event\n?    Date of the accident or potential event\n?    Date the investigation was begun\n?    Factors contributing to the accident or event\n?    Any recommendations resulting from the investigation\nCorrective actions will be implemented promptly.  The results of the investigation will be reviewed with affected workers (VWR and vendors) whose job tasks are relevant to the incident.  The incident investigation report and all supporting documentation will be retained for minimum of five (5) years.\n",

The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers (typically ranging from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single A?covered processA? for regulatory purposes.  The VWR facility is considered to be covered under the Program 2 eligibility requirements (per 68.10A?) because VWR is not covered by one of the SIC codes listed under Program 3 nor OSHAA?s Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nAt the present time, chloroform in stock and anticipates that it may exceed the Threshold Quantity (TQ) for that substance under the revised New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJ TCPA).  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a hypothetical incident in which the single largest container stored at the site, a 200 liter (55 gallon)  drum, is pierced by a forklift and the contents are otherwise spilled on the floor of the distribution center.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Guidance For Chemical Distributors was used to determine the farthest distance from the facility "
