      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nChinchiolo Stemilt California (CSC) located in Stockton, California handles ammonia (anhydrous), which is considered an extremely hazardous substance (EHS). CSC follows to applicable Federal and State rules and regulations for the operation of the ammonia refrigeration processes. Procedures for the operation, maintenance and emergency actions have been developed and training is provided to pertinent personnel on the procedures. The facility is a non-responding facility and has implemented an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The EAP includes procedures for the evacuation of employees to designated assembly areas and notifying emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nCSC processes cherries for domestic sale and export during the April to June harvest season. The fruit is preserved from deterioration by refrigeration throughout the cleaning, sorting, fumigation and packaging process. CSC stores other fruits and bare root trees in their cold storage rooms the remainder of the year. Anhydrous ammonia at CSC is contained within two separate closed loop refrigeration systems. The CSC-North refrigeration system has an estimated inventory of 20,000 pounds and the CSC-South refrigeration has an estimated inventory of 18,000 pounds. The inventory of each system exceeds the 10,000-pound threshold quantity and are therefore subject to California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and Federal Risk Management Program (RMP) Level 3 and State and Federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. Each CSC system includes mechanical rooms, hydrocoolers, air cooling evaporators in the cold storage and the controlled atmosphere (CA) rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility complies with applicable federal and state codes and regulat"

      "SummaryText": "ions. Safety meetings and safety training is provided to authorized and affected employees. The general accidental release prevention program incorporates requirements of CalARP, federal RMP and state and federal PSM programs. The facility incorporates equipment manufacturers' recommendations, industry standards such as those developed by International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and other refrigeration industry recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP) in the release prevention programs and management of the processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving the release of ammonia within the past five years at the facility.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nCSC is a non-responding facility and has implemented an EAP. The EAP requires the evacuation of facility personnel to designated assembly areas, if required, and assistance from the Linden Peters Fire Department and other emergency response agencies. Roll call will be taken at the assembly areas to account for employees. CSC is included in the Local Emergency Planning Committee Region IV Community Response Plan, is included in the Hazardous Materials Business Plan program and annually coordinates their EAP with local emergency response agencies. \r\n\r\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nApplicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the CalARP/RMP/PSM program to indicate if improvements may improve safety. Planned changes to improve safety developed under the CalARP/RMP/PSM program are implemented as scheduled by the company. Planned changes include extending the condenser catwalks for better access to isolation valves and service points, improvement of pipe and equipment marking and labelling, installing additional eyewash showers and increasing eyewash/shower visibility."
