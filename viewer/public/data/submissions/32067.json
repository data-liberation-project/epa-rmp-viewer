      "SummaryText": "Superior Deshler receives, stores and distributes Anhydrous Ammounia at the facility located on HWY 136 west of Deshler, Nebraska. The maximum storage quanity of Anhydrous is 403,520 lbs. The facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III.\nWorst Case Scenario - A maximum of 403,520 lbs of Anydrous Ammonia could be released in a gaseous state over a duration of 10 minutes at 14,020 lbs/minute into the rural area surrounding the plant up to 1.10 miles radius. The offsite consequences could include approximately 9000 people, including residential, schools and commercial industrial personnel.\nAlternative Release Scenario - A transfer hose failure of Anhydrous Ammonia has the potenial to relase 26,638 lbs of product in a gaseous state over 2 minutes at a rate of 13,319 lbs/min in the rural rea surrounding the plant up to .59 miles. The offsite consequences could include approximately 600 people. The effected population would include residential, school and commerical industrial individuals.\nThe owners, management and employees at the facility are prepared to work with local fire department and other authorities to minimize the impact of any release to the community and the environment.The facility has had no such release in the past 5 years. Complying with safety standards for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and competing regular maintenance on the equipment at the factility will continue to prvent any accidental releases at the Sueprior Deshler plant at Deshler."
