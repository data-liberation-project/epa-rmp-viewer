The scrubber will activate automatically when the concentration of chlorine in the chlorine storage or feed room reaches 3 ppm.  When activated, it must be manually shut off unless chlorine is detected at the exhaust, in which case it will automatically shut down to contain the release.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have had no reportable accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe written emergency response program as mentioned in the opening paragraph incorporates an ongoing training program.  Fire Department inspections/tours are conducted annually, verifying on-site chemicals, storage locations, chemical hazards, special instructions and requirements.  Drills at the company are coordinated with the local fire department.  Public notification is handled in accordance with our Emergency Action Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAlthough there are no immediate plans for changes to improve safety at this facility, we constantly review advancements in safety and process technology in the continuing pursuit to provide a safer workplace and community. This is evidenced by the recent installation of the chlorine scrubber."

The hazards of chlorine make it necessary to employ certain safety precautions in its use and handling to reduce the likelihood of human and environmental exposure in both the workplace and community.  \nIt is Illinois-American Water Company's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety is inherent on the manner that covered process chemicals are handled and used, the safety devices employed in the design of the feed system, as well as operating procedures and training of employees.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan is based on OSHA Standards 29CFR1910.38,  29CFR1910.120, and on experience gained from community drills.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nChlorine: Greenish-yellow gas with a pungent irritating odor.  Chlorine is liquified under pressure but is used as a gas at ambient temperature.  Illinois-American Water Company uses chlorine gas for water disinfection.\nThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at the Dodge Street facility is 6,000 pounds.  The chlorine is delivered by truck in 1-ton cylinders. Liquid chlorine is evaporated into gas in the cylinder.  The gas is fed by vacuum into the flow stream and metered through a chlorinator. \n\nSenior management is committed to the safe operation of our facilities and cognizent of the impact any deviation in processes might have on the surrounding communities.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility and process uses design codes and standards from the Chlorine Institute, Wallace and Tiernan Manuals, American National Standards Institute, American Society for Testing and Materials, and applicable state codes and regulations.  \nThe vacuum system by which chlorine is fed is designed to close the reg"
