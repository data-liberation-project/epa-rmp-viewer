      "SummaryText": "\nButte-Silver Bow Basin Creek Reservior, Basin creek Road\n\nThe Basin Creek Reservoir Process is an unfiltered water source that uses approximately 70  pounds of Chlorine each day as a disinfection agent process that provides the community with safe drinking water and effective sanitation in compliance with State regulations.  Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant and it has been safely used to disinfect drinking water for nearly 100 years.  Chlorine reduces or eliminates the risk of such waterborn diseases as Cholera, Typhoid, and Dysentery.\n\nBSB has long understood the hazards of handling Chlorine, which if not handled properly can pose a risk to the community.  Chlorine is listed by the EPA's Risk Management Rule (RMPR).  Since BSB has more than 2,500 pounds of Chlorine on its site it is required by the EPA to submit a Risk Management Plan.  The RMPR has helped enhance the exsisting safety programs such, as the repirator protection plan, a regular maintence program and an annual safety training program to address changes in the system and chemicals used at the facility. It has also ensured that in the unlikely event of a release, local emergency responders and other authorities are fully trained and ready to engage specific plans to remediate the situation quickly and safely.\n\nThe Basin Creek Reservoir has been used by Butte-Silver Bow as a water source since 1893.  In the past 5 years, it has not expereinced an accident involving Chlorine or the storage of Chlorine.\n\nThe Basin Creek Process is owned by the City and County of Butte-Silver Bow and is a separte process from our Bighole Water Treatment facility.  The Basin Creek Process is operated and controled by the Bighole Water Treatment facility and is contiuntally monitored for compliance and safe delivery of water to the community.  The facility treats on average approximately about 3.5 million gallons of water per day.  The facility was upgraded in 1990 and meets all requirements for a water distribu"

The Basin Creek Water Process has had no reportable accidents within the past 5 years and is a modern facility with many safety requirments built into it including telementry leak detectors and warning systems.  \n\nThe U.S. EPA had developed the Risk Management Plan regulations to prevent and minimize the impacts of an accidental release from the Basin Creek Water Process.  These rules are applicalble to the Basin Creek Process and are designed to prevent or address the impacts of a release from the site.  In an effort to comply with the regulations BSB has determined the worst case scenario and how to address a chemical release from the site.  BSB has developed an emergency plan to deal with the possibility of a release.  The plan includes first responders, such as the BSB Fire Department, BSB Sheriff's Department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the residences surrounding the plant.\n\nThe Butte-Silver Bow has performed the necessary Hazard Assessments, Prevention Programs, and Emergency Response Plans for Basin Creek Reservoir system.  The employee of the Basin Creek/Bighole Water Treatment Facility have been trained on the use of Chlorine and other chemicals throughout both facilities.  They poses the necessary knowledge of the use of these chemicals and how to maintain the equipment to minimize an exposure to themselves and others.\n\nBSB is confident that the added protection of the Risk Management Plan will ensure that its personnel, the environment and the community will contiune to remain safe and healthy.\n\n\nPatrick T.  McCarthy\nRisk Manager, Butte-Silver Bow"
