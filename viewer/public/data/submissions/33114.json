Port Arthur is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC.  The two members of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC are ChevronTexaco Corporation and ConocoPhillips Petroleum Company.   Both ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips are international petroleum and chemical companies.\n\nOne of the feedstocks to the Chevron Phillips manufacturing plant is a propylene/propane mixture and is received by barge and stored in bullets.  The unloading facility and bullets are remotely located from the manufacturing plant.  The feedstock is transferred via pipeline from the bullets to the manufacturing plant.  This RMP only covers the unloading & storage facility for the propylene/propane mixture.  There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Dock unloading facility.  \n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal employs approximately 4 full time equivalent employees.  This facility is managed by Mr. Richard Cuneo, Plant Manager.   Mr. Bill Andes, Compliance Manager, is responsible for RMP implementation for this site.  \n\nJefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-722-4371) is the primary organization responsible for coordinating emergency response operations for this area.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is an active member of this organization.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is also a member of Sabine Neches Chiefs Association, a mutual assistance emergency response organization dedicated to providing fire protection and safety management resources to the petrochemical industry of Jefferson County.  In the event of a major release of any hazardous substance or a fire, Chevron Phillips Chemical would coordinate emergency response with these groups as well as the appropriate governmental agencies.
