The scope of the work was upgrades to equipment.  The contractor was responsible for the purging of tank and lines so new valves and appurtances could be installed on the tank and a new solenoid valve, for remote shutoff, could be installed.  The contractor had partially purged the tank and lines on the first day of the project. On the second day of the project the contractor failed to open a valve on the process line to purge the line.  When the contractor attempted to unbolt a flange residual ammonia in the line released for an estimated 10-15 seconds. The contractor was in close proximity to the flange and experienced second degree burns of the face, left arm, chest.  Corrective action focused on the need for contractor to have a written checklist for working on equipment at customer locations \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nEast Penn's Hazardous Materials Team is trained to the Operations Level.

East Penn provides jobs for over 5000 employees and is one of the regions largest employers.  In conjunction with lead storage battery manufacture at the Lyon Station, PA site, East Penn owns and operates a secondary lead smelter for the purpose of reclaiming lead and other materials from spent batteries.  East Penn recycles nearly 100% of materials from used, spent lead-acid batteries.  The smelter utilizes an ammonia scrubber to remove Sulfur Dioxide from the process gas streams of both the reverbatory and blast furnaces and maintains onsite a 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank and piped delivery system to the scrubber headers.   The ammonia scrubber and ammonia tank and piping was designed and built according to generally accepted good engineering practices in accordance with the requirements of the ASME code for pressure vessels and 29 CFR 1910.111 - Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nAs stated in our written EHS policy, East Penn is committed to complying with all applicable government regulations and producing batteries in a way that does not jeopardize the health and safety of employees, community and the environment.  This includes taking reasonable precautions and establishing systems to ensure that a release of anhydrous ammonia at hazardous concentrations does not occur.   \n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Release Prevention Program has been established and implemented according to the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.119 and consists of the following elements:  1.  Visual and  documented  inspection of tank, valves, gauges and piping by Smelter management.  2.  Visual inspection of tank and components by anhydrous ammonia supplier.  3.  Triannual compliance audit of process safety management plan and update of process hazard analysis .  4.  Initial training and refresher training f"
