This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety and environmental consequences in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant, located in Geismar, Louisiana, operates a cracking and fractionation process to produce ethylene, propylene, crude butadiene and debutanized aromatic concentrate from ethane and propane feedstocks. The Geismar Ethylene Plant is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 \u00bf Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  The Geismar Ethylene Plant has regulated flammable substances including, propane, 1,3-butadiene, propylene, ethylene and ethane.  Additionally, the plant uses chlorine, which is also a regulated toxic substance.\n\nThe coordinates of the Geismar Ethylene Plant is, 30o, 14\u00bf, 09\u00bf N Latitude and 91 o, 03\u00bf, 02\u00bf Longitude measured at the center of the facility. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant has had an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  Every incident is investigated very carefully to determine ways to prevent the incident or similar incidents from recurring.  Table 1 below is a summary of the RMP-reportable incident(s) that have occurred during the last 5 years.\n \nTable 1. Five-year Release History of the Geismar Ethylene Plant.\nRegulated Substance\tDate, T"

Because the process at the Geismar Ethylene Plant is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, the elements of these programs are listed below.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requir"

      "SummaryText": "ements.  In addition, the Geismar Ethylene Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency control program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Geismar Ethylene Plant processes or other Geismar Ethylene Plant facilities. \n\nThe overall emergency control program for the Geismar Ethylene Plant is coordinated with the Ascension and Iberville Parishes Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committees, which include local emergency state officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Geismar Ethylene Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., sheriff\u00bfs office, Geismar Area Mutual Aid, complex emergency brigade, etc.).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Geismar \nEthylene Plant conducts periodic emergency drills. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant is committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective."
