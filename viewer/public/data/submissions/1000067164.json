As part of the production process, Electronic Fluorocarbons uses propylene.  The propylene process invovles liquid transfill of high purity propylene from a mobile bulk tank using a liquid pump. The transfill is monitored on a highly accurate cylinder fill scale calibrated with NIST weights.\n\n\n\nElectronic Fluorocarbons is committed to safe operations.  Appropriate accidental release prevention and emergency response documentation outlines the appropriate policies.\n\n\n\nElectronic Fluorocarbons'prevention program account for the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of 40 CFR Part 68.  The Program Level 3 Program maintains policies and documentation as needed for process safety information process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, complaince auditing, inciendt investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractors.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents with the propylene covered process at this facility.\n\n\n\nElectronic Fluorocarbons works with emergency response personnel in implementing its emergency response program.\n\n\n\nElectronic Fluorocarbons continues to review its RMP Program for improvements and work in developing and implementing such improvements.\n\n"
