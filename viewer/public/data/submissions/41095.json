(FTC&H) has been retained by Grand Haven/Spring Lake Wastewater Treatment Plant (GH/SL) to revise and resubmit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility located at 1525 Washington, Grand Haven, Michigan. GH/SL is a municipal wastewater treatment plant. A site location map and site plan are shown as Figures 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nAs required in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act Risk Management Program rules listed in 40 CFR Part 68, this document contains information intended to analyze the impacts of an accidental release of an extremely hazardous substance and to highlight the steps the facility is taking to prevent a release from occurring. The intent of the rule is to reduce the likelihood of a chemical release and the consequences of a release if one were to occur. The process utilizes chlorine and sulfur dioxide which are both regulated substances under the Risk Management Program.\n \nBecause of the potential hazards when using chlorine and sulfur dioxide, it is essential that steps be taken to minimize the risk of a catastrophic release. The prevention program for GH/SL includes process safety information(PSI), a process hazard analysis (PHA), and procedures for the following: operating, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, prestartup safety review, compliance audit, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractors. The purposes of the PSI are to compile and update written process safety information for use by employees, PHA Teams, and auditors. The PHA identifies, evaluates, and controls the hazards and risks associated with processes using regulated substances. \n\nThe operating procedures are instructions for initial and emergency startup operations; normal, temporary, and emergency operations; and emergency and normal shutdown operations. Training ensures that operators and other personnel working on or near regulated processes are properly"
