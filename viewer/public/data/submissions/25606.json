      "SummaryText": "This is a facility in a town of 150 person.  The accidental release prevention we have in place are relief valves and automatic shut-offs if a certain quantity is released.  The regulated substance that we have is anhydrous ammonia.  The worst case scenario is if one of the anhydrous ammonia bulk tanks release 49,900 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.  The alternative release scenario is if a transfer hose leaks.  This release wouldn't be very large due to the safety valves we have in place on the bulk anhydrous ammonia tank.  The facility has no 5 year accident history.  There has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia in the last 5+ years.  2 of the 3 employees are on the local volunteer fire department with the manager being the fire chief.  Our safety procedures have been to give employees a hands-on walk through of the anhydrous ammonia facility pointing out proper prodedures and safety items.  These informal safety sessions have been documented.  Due to the RMPprogram, we have a policy to document all safety procedure reviews and meetings.  The emergency response plans include shutting off the manual valves and contacting the fire department, if needed."
