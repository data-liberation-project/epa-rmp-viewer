The Salisbury facility has always put safety first.  \n\nNational Starch & Chemical Company stores the following RMP-applicable compounds on-site in quantities that exceed the applicable threshold quantities:  acrylonitrile (CAS No. 107-13-1), formaldehyde (CAS NO. 50-00-0), sulfur trioxide (CAS No. 7446-11-9), and vinyl acetate (CAS No. 108-05-4).  \n\nNational Starch & Chemical Company currently maintains an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program for the aforementioned compounds.  National Starch has previously analyzed hazards associated with these processes and developed emergency response plans for responding to incidents involving these compounds.  \n\nNational Starch & Chemical Company has evaluated one worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated toxics.  This release scneario is based on the release of the entire contents of a 6,000-gallon sulfur trioxide storage tank into a diked area.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.4 miles based on the EPA's SLAB Model.  Public receptors within this impact zone include several local residences and businesses.  There are no environmental receptors within this impact radius.  \n\nNational Starch & Chemical Company evaluated an alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic.

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.02 miles based on the EPA's SLAB Model. This impact radius does not extend off-site.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur trioxide is the release of 5,000 lbs.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.2 miles based on the EPA's SLAB Model.  Public receptors within this impact zone include several local residences and businesses.
