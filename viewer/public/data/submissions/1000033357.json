Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers (5) where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the thermosyphon receiver (TSR) and the HPRs.  The liquid ammonia in the thermosyphon receiver is used to cool the oil in the two FES screw compressors.  Liquid ammonia flows into the oil cooler vessel and the vapor/liquid mixture is syphoned back to the TSR.  A portable auto purger is used to remove non-condensibles collected in the high pressure receiver and the condensers.  The purger is mounted on a portable rack and can be used at both Plant 1 and Plant 2.  As the pressure in the process increases, the purger is connected and left to run for approximately one week to remove any non-condensibles.

The glycol accumulator sends high temperature liquid ammonia to two glycol heat exchangers.  At the wine chillers and glycol heat exchangers, liquid ammonia partially vaporizes as it absorbs heat from the wine product or glycol flowing inside these units.  The resulting vapor in the heat exchangers is returned to the glycol accumulator.  Vapor from the wine chillers and glycol accumulator is drawn off to the low pressure accumulator which is equipped with a liquid transfer vessel (LTV).

These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).

The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) addressing ammonia releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the fire department as necessary for assistance.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Woodbridge Winery has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."

Since its inception, it has been committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration systems.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  Woodbridge Winery has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nWoodbridge Winery is located at 5950 East Woodbridge Road in Acampo, California.
