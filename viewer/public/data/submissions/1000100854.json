The facility has a trained emergency response team that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation. The Emergency Response Plan contains specific information regarding Emergency Response organization and procedures, as well as incident notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness. In addition, Perdue's training program includes annual refreshers. Perdue has also developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to address other emergency response related incidents such as bomb threats, spills or releases of hazardous materials, evacuation, and tornados or dangerous weather conditions.\r\n\r\n* Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nDraper Valley Farms has installed an ammonia gas detection system and exhaust fans in the Mechanical Room and Remote Recirculation Room. In order to minimize the exposure of facility personnel in the event of a release, exhaust fans will be activated if the ammonia concentration is detected inside the rooms above threshold concentrations. The facility also updated the alarm system for the blast compressor and water chill compressor room. Draper continues to conduct periodic vibration analysis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration system. In addition, as part of Draper Valley Farms' continuous improvement philosophy, Draper Valley Farms facilities continue to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety."
