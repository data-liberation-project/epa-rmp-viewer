      "SummaryText": "As indicated within the RMP, Iroquois Bio-Energy, LLC (IBE) is committed to the general health and safety of IBE?s employees and those in the community.  IBE has developed and implemented an Emergency Response Plan for the facility that includes employee training and coordination with the local emergency responders.  IBE has developed its operating and maintenance procedures, training programs, and compliance reviews to assist in the analysis of potential hazards and to manage potential risks associated with the manufacturing of ethanol.  To date, IBE has not had any accidents at the facility since it began operations in December 2006.  Please see below for a brief description of the ethanol manufacturing process.\n\nThe Ethanol Plant was began operations in December 2006.  The Ethanol Plant was constructed with several buildings on site: a dried distillers? grain with solubles (DDGS) process building; a fermentation building; a distillation building; a maintenance building; and an administration building.  Above-ground storage tanks (ASTs) of 190-Proof and 200-Proof Ethanol, Denatured Ethanol, Denaturant and a Corrosion Inhibitor are stored outside within a containment berm.   An anhydrous ammonia tank is also located outside in the vicinity of the ASTs.\n\nCorn is delivered to the Ethanol Plant by truck or rail for storage prior to use.  The corn is ground and routed to the fermentation process where water and enzymes are added to convert the corn to a mash.  Yeast is then added to the mash to begin the fermentation process.  During the fermentation process, carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is generated from the fermentation tanks, and the gas is then routed through a scrubber prior to liquefaction.  Any condensate or wastewater generated as a result of the scrubbing process is routed back to the fermentation mash for distillation and dehydration.  The fermentation tanks are designed with clean-in-place (CIP) systems for cleaning prior to refilling, and no discharge of wastew"

      "SummaryText": "ater from the CIP systems occurs.  \n\nDuring the distillation process, the solids and most of the water in the ?beer? produced during the fermentation process is separated from the ethanol-laden ?beer?.  A vacuum distillation system then divides the alcohol from the corn mash, and both streams are routed to the dehydration equipment.  The distillation system strips the ethanol from the beer and concentrates it to 188-Proof.  The ethanol vapor is then condensed and stored prior to being pumped to the molecular sieve where it is vaporized before dehydration.  The 188-Proof ethanol vapor passes through a sieve bed where water is removed and 199(+)-Proof fuel grade ethanol vapor is produced.  Other vent gases or vapors associated with the distillation and dehydration processes are routed to the thermal oxidizer for control.   \n\nIBE has developed a worse-case scenario for both the toxic and flammable chemicals present at the facility in connection with the above process.  These chemicals include: ethanol, denaturant, and anhydrous ammonia."
