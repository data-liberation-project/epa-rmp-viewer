INDSPEC Chemical Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (? 68.155(a))\n\nINDSPEC Chemical Corporation has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Petrolia, PA facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Petrolia, PA facility.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (? 68.155(b))\n\nThe INDSPEC Chemical Corporation Petrolia, PA facility consists of a chemical production plant that is wholly owned by Occidental Petroleum Corporation.  INDSPEC Chemical Corporation operates the plant at the site.  The facility handles 3 substances that are regulated by the RMP rule.  These substances are as follows:\n\nOLEUM, ETHYL ETHER, FORMALDEHYDE\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (? 68.155(d))\n\nThe Petrolia, PA  facility?s prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information,Process Hazard Analysis,Operating Procedures,\nTraining,Mechanical Integrity,Management of Change,\nPre-Startup Review,Compliance Audits,Incident Investigation,\nEmployee Participation,K"

These manuals are routinely updated.\n\nFive-year Accident History (? 68.155(e))\n\nThere were not any RMP accidents at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program (? 68.155(f))\n\nThe Petrolia, PA facility has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (?ERT?) trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (?ECC?).  In addition, the Petrolia, PA facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (?SSP?) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe facility supports the efforts of the Butler County Local Emergency Planning Committee (?LEPC?), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (? 68.155(g))\n\nThe Petrolia, PA facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.\n\nCertification Statement\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\nOriginal on Cover Letter                                                      \n--------------------------------------------------                          ------------------"
