(GPC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific LLC, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Lufkin, Texas which is referenced as the A?plantA? throughout the remainder of the document. The facility is located on East Lufkin Avenue. The resin facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1962 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins. The formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1977. Both of these processes contain a raw material tank farm, the process equipment itself and a finished product tank farm.   Overall, the facility employs 62 full-time employees.\n\nGPC is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection AgencyA?s (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\nA?a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule ("

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPC limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GPC considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPC prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPC trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPC works with the local fire department to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Pl"

GPC implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPC provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the local voluntary fire department.  In order to effectively implement these policies, GPC established a management system headed by the facility safety coordinator, to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 Regulated Substances\nThe Plant handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, Formaldehyde and Ethylenediamine.\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis:  \nThe OCA was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 68, Subpart B.  The OCA is summarized in Section 2-5 of the RMP Registration.\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSince 1962, the Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1993, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are used to (l) train employees, (2) perform process hazards analyses, (3) evaluate process changes, and (4) help maintain the equipment.\n\n1.4.1.2 Process Hazard Analysis\nThe Plant performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the A?what-if /checklistA? in combination with HAZOP guidewords PHA methodology to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n1.4.1.3 Operating Procedures\nPlant process engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.

      "SummaryText": "However, to make-up for shortfalls in formaldehyde production, some formaldehyde is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors. The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde storage tank(s).  The storage tank(s) design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant.   The storage tank(s) is surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain at least 100% of the volume of the tank should its entire contents be spilled.  All air emissions from the storage tank(s) are directed to a catalytic oxidizer and absorber tower, which destroys in excess of 98% of the HAP emissions. \n\n100% Ethylenediamine-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of ethylenediamine (EDA).  EDA is commercially purchased directly from a vendor(s) per customer specifications.  The EDA vendor supplies EDA via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when unloading to the Reactor K-4.  Workers who perform operations involving EDA receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for EDA as developed by the plant.  The EDA unloading system is surrounded by a concrete dike with sufficient volume to contain the entire contents of one tank truck.  Routine Air emissions from unloading and manufacturing of EDA containing products are controlled by a thermal oxidizer.  \n \n1.5 Five Year Accident History\nThe plant has completed a review of the five-year accident history for the plant.  Based on this review, there were no releases, which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite or  known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\nThe Plant has established a written emergency response progr"
