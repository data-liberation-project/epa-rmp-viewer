(GPC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific LLC, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Lufkin, Texas which is referenced as the \u00c2\u00bfplant\u00c2\u00bf throughout the remainder of the document. The facility is located on East Lufkin Avenue. The resin facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1962 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins. The formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1977. Both of these processes contain a raw material tank farm, the process equipment itself and a finished product tank farm.   Overall, the facility employs 62 full-time employees.\n\nGPC is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00c2\u00bfs (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n\u00c2\u00bfa hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule ("

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPC limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GPC considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPC prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPC trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPC works with the local fire department to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Pl"

GPC implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPC provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the local voluntary fire department.  In order to effectively implement these policies, GPC established a management system headed by the facility safety coordinator, to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 Regulated Substances\nThe Plant handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, Formaldehyde and Ethylenediamine.\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis:  \nThe OCA was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 68, Subpart B.  The OCA is summarized in Section 2-5 of the RMP Registration.\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSince 1962, the Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant\u00c2\u00bfs safe work practices, and the plant\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.  The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n1.4.2 Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant.  The following paragraphs describe some of these features.\n\n50% Formaldehyde solution-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  Most of the formaldehyde stored in the plant\u00c2\u00bfs storage vessels is piped directly from the formaldehyde plant."

      "SummaryText": "However, to make-up for shortfalls in formaldehyde production, some formaldehyde is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors. The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde storage tank(s).  The storage tank(s) design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant.   The storage tank(s) is surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain at least 100% of the volume of the tank should its entire contents be spilled.  All air emissions from the storage tank(s) are directed to a catalytic oxidizer and absorber tower, which destroys in excess of 98% of the HAP emissions. \n\n100% Ethylenediamine-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of ethylenediamine (EDA).  EDA is commercially purchased directly from a vendor(s) per customer specifications.  The EDA vendor supplies EDA via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when unloading to the Reactor K-4.  Workers who perform operations involving EDA receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for EDA as developed by the plant.  The EDA unloading system is surrounded by a concrete dike with sufficient volume to contain the entire contents of one tank truck.  Routine Air emissions from unloading and manufacturing of EDA containing products are controlled by a thermal oxidizer.  \n \n1.5 Five Year Accident History\nThe plant has completed a review of the five-year accident history for the plant.  Based on this review, there were no releases, which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite or  known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\nThe Plant has established a written emergency response progr"

The emergency response plan includes procedures for the following:\n\n\u00c2\u00bfinforming the local fire department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n\u00c2\u00bfproviding proper first aid and emergency  medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances at the plant\n\u00c2\u00bfcontrolling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\n\u00c2\u00bfinspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n\u00c2\u00bfreviewing and updating the emergency response plan\n\nThe Plant maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  The plant periodically conducts emergency response drills.  Also,drills are coordinated with the local fire department every three years and the frequency is also dependent on state regulations. An annual prefire inspection is also conducted by the local fire department.  The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a) and has communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department.  The plant maintains a regular dialogue with the local fire chief, and the plant provides appropriate information to the fire chief.\n\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety \nThe Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of the processes through the following changes, which will improve our process safety. \n\n\u00c2\u00bfRevalidation of PHAs as well as new PHAs will continue.\n\u00c2\u00bfJob Hazard Analysis\u00c2\u00bf will be completed on a priority, based on the hazard(s) involved to conduct a task.
