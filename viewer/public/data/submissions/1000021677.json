      "SummaryText": "The Midlothian Water Treatment Plant (WTP) provides treated water to residential, commercial and industrial sectors of the City.  The facility is located at 440 Taxman Drive in Midlothian.  Untreated water is processed at the WTP and then disinfected with chlorine, which is fed to the water system from one-ton containers.\nIn the treatment process, the facility stores and uses chlorine in quantities exceeding the regulatory threshold established in 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.  The facility's Risk Management Program has been developed to identify and minimize the potential for a release of chlorine from the facility.\n\nOff Site Consequence Analysis\nThe off-site consequences of a potential accidental release of each regulated chemical stored at or above the threshold quantity were evaluated for the WTP RMP.  Chlorine was the only chemical at the facility that required an off-site consequence analysis.\nTwo types of release models, a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario, were required to be assessed in the off-site consequence analysis.  In each scenario, a chlorine release was assumed to occur, and the distance to the specific chlorine concentration in the air specified in the RMP regulations was determined.  In each release scenario, the distance to the toxic endpoint concentration, the population within the release area, public receptors (such as schools, hospitals, and churches), and sensitive environmental receptors (such as protected wildlife areas) were identified.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe City takes pride in the safe operation of its water treatment plant.  Facility operators are trained in the operation and maintenance of equipment through a variety of methods, including onsite classroom training, off-site classroom training, and on-the-job supervised training. Physical safety features for the chlorination system include leak detectors, alarms, a wind sock, safety eye wash, and an emergency leak repair kit."

      "SummaryText": "Procedures for the operation of the chlorination system have been developed and operators receive training in those procedures. A schedule for preventive maintenance activities has been developed for chlorination system components. The schedule was developed based on manufacturers' recommendations.\n \nFive-Year Accident History\nNo releases of chlorine have occurred from the facility in the last five years.\n \nEmergency Response Program\nMinor chlorine leaks, such as trace detections of chlorine gas from a cylinder changeout operation, are handled by facility operators. If at any time, the leak is considered to be escalating in nature to the point of a significant release, the emergency action plan is implemented. The emergency action plan calls for onsite personnel to evacuate the facility to a secure location and to notify the City Fire Department to conduct emergency response activities. Any significant chlorine leak that potentially threatens the health of on-site personnel or the community or environment off-site results in the activation of the emergency action plan.\n\nSafety Changes\nAll identified safety changes will be completed by April 30, 2006."
