Chlorine has been recognized as a preferred agent for disinfecting wastewater and the Pollard Creek Wastewater Treatment facility utilizes chlorine solely for this purpose. The facility utilizes chlorine in one-ton capacity cylinders with a maximum of eight cylinders stored at the facility.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program Rule requires that covered facilities report the number of accidental chlorine releases during the past five years. The Pollard Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has experienced zero (0) chlorine releases during the past five years.\n\nThe Pollard Creek Wastewater Treatment facility is attended at all times with trained operators, including personnel recognized as Certified Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators. To help ensure the safety of chlorine operations, the facility maintains the following information and programs: chlorine safety information, hazard reviews, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, training, and compliance audits. Chlorine process equipment is inspected on an ongoing basis, and emphasis is placed on the proper maintenance of the equipment. \n\nThe facility maintains an emergency action plan that includes instructions for immediately requesting assistance from the City of Mineral Wells Fire Department in the event of an emergency release of chlorine and for making appropriate notifications to public agencies. A chlorine cylinder repair kit is maintained at the plant to facilitate timely termination of any cylinder leaks that may occur. Information has been provided to the Palo Pinto County LEPC for coordinating the facility's plans with the community emergency response plans.
