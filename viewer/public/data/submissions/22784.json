This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in \naccident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, \noperation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent \nforeseeable releases of hazardous chemicals.  However, if a release does occur, our trained \npersonnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex consists of eight operating units linked by multiple pipelines.  The complex, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of \nState Highway 35 and FM 524, about 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston.  The complex also operates a terminal and a storage facility, along with the pipelines that connect this \nfacility to the main plant and its markets.  The complex produces 4.5 billion pounds of ethylene \nper year.  In our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the \npotential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:  None\n\nFlammables:  Normal Butane, Ethylene, Propane, Propylene, Ethane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, \n2-Butene-cis, Butene, Isobutane, 2-Butene, Hydrogen, Isopentane, Methane, Pentane, 1,3-\nButadiene, Propyne, Isoprene, 1-Pentene, Propadiene, 1,3-Pentadiene, 2-Pentene (E), Vinyl \nacetylene\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored or used within the complex which are above the inventory \nlimits as defined by the EPA.  For this reason, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP has no \nworst case (WCS) and alternate release scenarios (ARS) for toxic chemicals entered in this Risk Managem"

This \nWCS assumes the entire inventory of this vessel is released, vaporizes and ignites, resulting in a \nvapor cloud explosion.  Although there are several controls to prevent such releases and to \nmanage their consequences, no credit for mitigation was taken into account in evaluating this \nscenario. The maximum distance to the 1 psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.6 miles (calculated using \nEPA's RMPComp).  This scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nThe ACS associated with flammable substances is a VCE involving a release of NGL (Propane, ethane, N-butane, isobutane, isopentane, N-pentane, heptanes plus, hexanes, methane, and n-hexane) which may \nbe caused by yielding the NGL pipeline flow (feed to Unit 10.2) through the flare stack to the \natmosphere while the flare is unlit.  The modeling was based upon a release of 38,950 lbs. of \nNGL.  Credit for active mitigation was taken into account in evaluating this scenario which was \noperator intervention.   The maximum distance to the 1 psi (or lower flammable level) endpoint \nfor this ACS is 0.3 miles (calculated using EPA's RMPComp).  This scenario has offsite impacts.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe following is a summary of the General Accidenal Releaset Prevention Program in place at the Chevron \nPhillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex.

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nSweeny Complex uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased \nmaintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process \nequipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors (1) perform their work in a \nsafe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their \nworkplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and \nfollow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their \nwork.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency \nresponse, including the following: proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures; evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation; notification of local emergency response agencies \nand the public if a release occurs; and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. \nIn addition, Sweeny Complex has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing \nof emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency \nresponse equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform \ntheir specific emergency response duties. The Emergency Response Program is updated when \nnecessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities. The \nEmergency Response Program changes are administered through the MOC process, which \nincludes informing and/or training affected personnel in these changes.\n\nThe overall Emergency Response Program for Sweeny Complex is coordinated with the Brazoria \nCounty Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic \nmeetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government \nofficials, and industry representatives. Sweeny Complex has around-the-clock communications \ncapability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire \ndepartment). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as \nfacilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Sweeny \nComplex conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response \norganizations.  In addition to the LEPC, the Sweeny Complex also has a Mutual Aid System in \nplace.  The Emergency Assistance Agreement Committee (EAAC) is a sub-committee of the \nIndustrial CAER org"
