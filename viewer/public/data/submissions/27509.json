Since each SCR process handles more \n\nthan 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Sunrise Power Company, LLC has \n\ndeveloped and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for \n\nthe SCR processes.  \n\n\n\nAs part of the PSM program, Sunrise Power Company, LLC has completed \n\nprocess hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained \n\nemployees on the SCR processes, conducted a pre-startup safety review, and \n\ndeveloped a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In \n\naddition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the SCR processes on a \n\ndaily basis, Sunrise Power Company, LLC has implemented a preventative \n\nmaintenance program to ensure that the SCR processes are maintained in good \n\noperating condition.  Plant personnel monitor the operation of the SCR processes \n\non a daily basis.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an \n\naccidental release.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Sunrise Power Company, LLC emphasizes safe and \n\nenvironmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their \n\nemployee training programs.  In addition to job specific and process specific \n\ntraining, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, \n\nfire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  \n\n\n\nWhile it is Sunrise Power Company, LLC's objective to be a responsible citizen of \n\nthe community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the power plant \n\nprecludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan \n\nhas been prepared for the Sunrise Power Company, LLC facility and a chain of \n\ncommand to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\n\n\nSunrise Power Company, LLC has developed a det"

The \"Phase II\" expansion included installation of \n\ntwo duct-fired heat recovery steam generators (HSRG) and a 265 megawatt \n\nsteam generator.  To help control the nitrogen oxide emissions from the gas \n\nturbine, each HRSG is equipped with an anhydrous ammonia-based selective \n\ncatalytic reduction (SCR) system.  \n\n\n\nIn the SCR process, anhydrous ammonia vapors from the storage tank are \n\ninjected into the high temperature turbine exhaust ahead of the catalytic reactor.  \n\nThe high temperature of the exhaust causes the ammonia to dissociate and \n\ncreate a reducing atmosphere before the flue gas enters the catalytic reactor.  \n\nThis reducing atmosphere in the turbine flue gas helps convert nitrogen oxides to \n\nnitrogen and water as the "

The \n\noperation of the SCR system substantially lowers the emissions of nitrogen \n\noxides from the gas turbine.\n\n\n\nThe SCR systems at the Sunrise Power Company, LLC facility are identical.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in two 5,300 gallon (water capacity) storage tanks.  \n\nThe maximum intended inventory of each anhydrous ammonia storage tank is \n\nphysically limited to approximately 4,500 gallons through the installation of a \n\noverflow stand pipe inside each tank.  The overflow stand pipe is installed on the \n\nammonia delivery vapor return line and limits the capacity of the tank to \n\napproximately 85 percent.  If the ammonia delivery truck operator fills the storage \n\ntank above 85 percent capacity, the excess ammonia is returned to the delivery \n\ntruck through the vapor line.  Additionally, each tank is equipped with a level \n\ntransmitter that will close emergency shutoff valves on the ammonia delivery \n\nlines if the tank level exceeds 85 percent.  Limiting the capacity of the anhydrous \n\nammonia storage tank to 85 percent establishes a maximum storage capacity of \n\napproximately 22,664 pounds.\n\n\n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 defines the \n\ntoxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nOffsite consequence analyses are used as tools to assist in emergency response \n\nplanning.

The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must \n\nanalyze the worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \n\nSince Sunrise Power Company, LLC's SCR systems are considered Program 3 \n\nprocesses, both release scenarios were evaluated in the offsite consequence \n\nanalysis.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimat"
