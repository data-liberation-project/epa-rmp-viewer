We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\n\n\nThe Greenwood Terminal has three Department of Transportation ? regulated pipelines that are routed through the facility.  These three pipelines are a mixed natural gas liquids line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane), a dedicated natural gas liquids (propane) line and a dedicated anhydrous ammonia line.  Each of these pipelines have electric driven pumps that add horsepower to the product transfer down the pipelines, or the pump system can be bypassed when the pumps are not needed or down for maintenance.  The Greenwood facility also receives propane from one of the two natural gas liquids pipelines to two 63,000 gallon capacity storage tanks.  These tanks are used for distribution to the three propane truck transport loading docks which also has capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Enterprise has one 400,000 barrel mined cavern for propane storage.  The product for this cavern comes to/from the propane pipelines.  The cavern is regulated by the Department of Transportation.\n\n\n\nThe Magellan anhydrous ammonia system receives anhydrous ammonia product off the anhydrous ammonia pipeline and is routed to their two 63,000 gallon storage tanks.  These tanks are used for distribution to their three ammonia truck transport loading docks.  Enterprise maintains and operates the system for Magellan.\n\n\n\nAll of the previously mentioned tanks (propane and ammonia) are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.\n\n\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is transported and stored at the facility via a dedicated anhydrous ammonia pipeline.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nThis simulation involves a complete failure of both anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  The scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the transfer loading hose on the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 2,500 pounds per minutes for 10 minutes after the hose break.  The simulation calculated that 25,000 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Lancaster County LEPC Director, which includes the Lancaster Sheriff?s Department, the local Police department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Lancaster County Sheriff?s Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from the system?s control center which is based in Houston, Texas.  The Enterprise Houston Control Center has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by operations personnel.  A third party contractor, 3E Company is under contract to contact the necessary agencies if required.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, protective appro"
