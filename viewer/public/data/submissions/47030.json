The LPR-H1 supplies pumped liquid to 18 evaporators located in Cooler Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. The rooms serviced by these evaporators range from 35\u00b0F to 45\u00b0F.  The evaporators use fans to blow air across the coils, which transfer heat from the room to the ammonia inside the coils.  As this occurs, the ammonia partially vaporizes (boils) and is returned back to the LPR-H1. \n\nThe LPR-H1 also supplies liquid to the low-temperature liquid pump recirculator (LPR-L1).  The LPR-L1 supplies pumped liquid to 6 evaporators located in Freezer 8 (-15\u00b0F ).  The resulting liquid/vapor mixture (suction) from these evaporators is returned to the LPR-L1. \n\nThe compressors (two stage) maintain a constant pressure in the respective liquid pump recirculator vessel based on the suction setpoint.  There are two booster compressors that collect low pressure vapor (6.2 psig) from the LPR-L1.  Discharge from the booster compressors (50 - 65 psig) flows to the intercooler where it is dispersed below the liquid level.  The intercooler serves to cool the super-heated vapor from the booster compressors prior to the second stage of compression at the high stage compressors (3).  These compressors pull medium temperature vapor (50 - 65 psig) from the intercooler and LPR-H1. The hot gas (high stage compressor discharge - 150 psig) is delivered to the condensers (3), where the latent heat in the ammonia vapor is discharged to the atmosphere, causing it to condense.  Hot gas is also used for defrosting the evaporator coils on an automatic timed cycle.  The condensers drain the high pressure liquid back to the high pressure receiver. \n\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia at the Fresh Food Concepts facility is 1"

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Fresh Food Concepts abides by the emergency response procedures and policies detailed in the Emergency Ammonia Action Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe facility occupants (tenants), plan to evacuate during an ammonia emergency scenario.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is located on a 55-acre parcel currently owned by PRI Buena Park Industrial CA, LLC  c/o Overton Moore Properties (OMP) 1125 W. 190th St. Gardena, CA  90248.  Fresh Food Concepts is located east of the juncture of the I-5 freeway and 22 freeway, and bounded by Knott Avenue to the East, Caballero Boulevard to the West and South, and the Fullerton Creek, Orange County Flood Control Channel to the North.  The location of the facility with respect to the local area is shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe Fresh Food Concepts facility consists of a warehouse storage building of approximately 140,000 square feet.  The building is cooled via an ammonia refrigeration system that maintains a maximum charge of 12,300 pounds of ammonia.  Figure 2 shows the layout of the Fresh Food Concepts facility.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the cooling system for the Fresh Food Concepts facility.

      "SummaryText": "2,300 pounds. \n\nC. HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity in the vessel.  If a vessel is located inside a building, the EPA allows a passive mitigation factor of 55% to be used in calculating the release rate to the outside atmosphere when the release is enclosed by a building.\n\nThe Low Temperature Liquid Pump Recirculator results in the highest release rate, and will therefore be used for the worst case release scenario.  The vessel is located outside the building, so no passive mitigation was considered.  The maximum ammonia charge of 12,300 lbs is limited by the vessel size.  \n\nRelease of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (Liquid Pump Recirculator) is 6,270 pounds in 10 minutes.  The EPA-approved guidance document, \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.\n\nFor analyzing the worst case release scenario, EPA requires the use of the most pessimistic meteorological conditions that will allow for the maximum downwind exposure.  Low wind speeds (1.5 m/s) and stable atmospheric conditions (F stability) will allow the gas cloud to travel as far as possible by limiting cloud dispersion.  The results are conservative.\n\nEPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", November 1998, Exhibit 4-4 was used to find the downwind distance for the worst case release to 200 ppm in an urban setting.  The RMP*Comp\u00bf Model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and EPA was used to prepare the data in this guidance document.  This guidance document provides data for ammonia refrigeration systems and will ensure consistency throughout the industry."

Reference tables in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration were used to determine the meaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release. \n\n\nD. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Fresh Food Concepts facility has many safety features, including those implemented on the ammonia refrigeration system.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with the State Office of Emergency Services' California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program as well as Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), and Federal EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Fresh Food Concepts facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include an ammonia diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room, cold storage areas, dock areas and relief header, pressure relief valves to protects vessels' integrity, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In the event of ammonia detection, audible and visual alarms are triggered throughout the facility. \n\nThe operation"

This ensures that the system is maintained properly by refrigeration experts and according to industry standards.  The refrigeration contractor is available 24 hours per day.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nE. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Fresh Food Concept facility\u00bfs accident history during the Five-Year Revalidation, revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years (October 2001 - October 2006). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\nF. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Fresh Food Concepts facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Orange County Fire Authority and the local fire houses.

Many of the recommendations are complete and implemented as of the system startup date in October 2001.  \n\nThe Seismic Assessment, performed on October 22, 2001, by a licensed structural engineer, also generated mitigation measures to improve the seismic adequacy of the refrigeration system and the building itself.  A Seismic Revalidation was completed in October 2006 and the recommendations resulting from this study will be implemented by the facility.\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, performed in October 2006, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Fresh Food Concepts facility located in Buena Park, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Fresh Food Concepts facility is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.
