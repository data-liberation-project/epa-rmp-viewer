      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTradeMark Nitrogen, Corp.  (TradeMark) is a producer of nitrogen-based fluid products located at 1216 Old Hopewell Road in Tampa, Florida.  An integral component of the manufacture of these products is anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia storage capacity of the facility, after administrative controls, is approximately 388,000 pounds.  This inventory exceeds the 10,000-pound threshold for anhydrous ammonia set by EPA under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule codified at 40 CFR 68.  Pursuant to the requirements of the rule, TradeMark has prepared this Risk Management Program (RMP) Plan. We are proud of our environmental, health, and safety efforts and programs and our record in these areas.  The following sections outline our RMP plan.   \n\nOVERALL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nOur Technical Manager and Safety and Worker Protection Manager serve as the facility's RMP and PSM Coordinators, respectively.  Together, these individuals share the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our President has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to the Technical Manager, a staff member with the necessary background, training, and experience.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the President, has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the EPA RMP elements.  In addition, the RMP Coordinator works closely with the Safety and Worker Protection Manager to integrate the elements of OSHA's PSM program (where applicable) as required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.  \n\nThe RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facility's RMP Steering Committee.  This committee comprises members with responsibilities for developing and managing specifi"

Currently, the members of the RMP Steering Committee include the following: \n\n *  RMP Coordinator (Technical Manager)\n *  PSM Coordinator (Safety and Worker Protection Manager)\n *  Production Manager\n *  Employee Representative(s)\n\nThe following sections identify the specific responsibilities for each aspect of our risk management and process safety management programs.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nThe Technical Manager has the responsibility for (1) ensuring that offsite consequence analyses for each regulated process are consistently performed and documented in accordance with Sections 68.20 through 68.39 and (2) selecting the scenarios that will be reported in the facility Risk Management Program Plan as required under Section 68.165. The Technical Manager also is responsible for ensuring that the accident history for each covered process is appropriately documented and maintained in accordance with Section 68.42 and 68.168 of the RMP rule.\n\nThe rule requires the evaluation of a worst case scenario, even though the likelihood of the occurrence of such a scenario may be extremely small.  The worst case scenario has been defined as a catastrophic release of the entire anhydrous ammonia inventory, 71,200 pounds, from Tank 601.  The distance to the toxic endpoint as predicted by the USAF Toxic Chemical Dispersion Model is 0.62 miles.  In addition to the worst case scenario, an alternative release scenario has been modeled employing more appropriate meteorological conditions and release assumptions.  In the alternative release scenario, 10 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per minute are assumed to be released from the lifting of a pressure relief valve.  A ten-minute release would be expected in such a scenario.  Based upon these assumptions, the distance to the endpoint as predicted by the same model employ"

At this distance, no impact on public receptors would be anticipated.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nTradeMark has had no reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia from the process since the commencement of operations at the Old Hopewell Road facility in 1983.  We have always taken a pro-active stance in the safety of our employees and the surrounding community and environment.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nThe RMP and PSM Coordinators have the responsibility for ensuring that the facility has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets EPA RMP (Sections 68.65 through 68.87 of the RMP rule) and OSHA PSM requirements.  Although the Coordinators have many specific individual responsibilities, some of the responsibilities for specific program elements are assigned to other members of the PSM and RMP Steering Committees (as listed in the following sections).\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe responsibility for process safety information (PSI) (Section 68.65 of the RMP rule) is divided between two individuals.  The Technical Manager has responsibility for process chemical and equipment information while the Production Manager has responsibility for process technology information.  The RMP Coordinator has the responsibility of ensuring that all of this information is readily accessible for use.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule, the RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for ensuring that process hazard analyses (PHAs) are scheduled, conducted, and documented by trained personnel for all regulated processes.  The PSM and RMP Coordinators identify candidate PHA team leaders from within the facility and ensure that they receive appropriate training before leading PHAs.  The Coordinators may also use outside contractors to lead PHAs when appropriate.
