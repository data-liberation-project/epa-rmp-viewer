The container storage and handling is conducted pursuant to per Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.    \r\n\r\nThe WTP operates twenty-four hour per day, seven days per week.  The chlorine gas is withdrawn from the one-ton containers by vacuum.  This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm and withdraws the gas from the one-ton containers at a controlled feed rate set by the operators with the use of the rotometer at the chlorinator unit. The chlorine gas is injected into the feed water line, where it becomes a chlorine/water solution and is fed where it is needed in the treatment process.  The container storage building has inlet and outlet exhaust fans for fresh air entry, chlorine leak detectors, and alarm systems. The vacuum regulators are vented to the inside of the chemical feed room. A scrubber neutralizes any chlorine vapors potentially leaving the feed room. \r\n\r\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substances are considered as part of one complete process.\r\n\r\n3a.  Administrative Controls\r\n\r\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.

Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no qualifying incidents involving the release of chlorine within the past five years at the facility.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of West Sacramento Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Yolo County - Environmental Health can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\r\n\r\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are being implemented at this time.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substances.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the City of West Sacramento is in the process of switching from chlorine gas to inherently safer technology, sodium hypochlorite.  The hypochlorite system has been designed and the conversion is scheduled to take place in 2016."

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nGeorge Kristoff Water Treatment Plant, located at 400 North Harbor Blvd., handles chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nGeorge Kristoff Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is designed to treat fresh water before distribution.  Chlorine gas is use for the disinfection in the water treatment process.  \r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered by a commercial chlorine supplier in one-ton containers for use at the WTP.  Off-loading of the one-ton container from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist. All the one-ton containers are placed in the chlorine storage area. Two of the chlorine containers that are on-line are placed on the load-cell scale. Two other chlorine containers are placed on stand-by, and ten more chlorine containers are in storage near-by.\r\n\r\nThe WTP has administrative procedures in place to limit the amount of chlorine at the WTP to no more than 16 one-ton containers for a total of 32,000 pounds.  Delivery of chlorine one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The driveway provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of the delivery vehicle during the off-loading of the full one-ton containers and loading of the empty one-ton containers.
