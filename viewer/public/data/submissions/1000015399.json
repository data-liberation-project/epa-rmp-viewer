As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible. To accomplish this elements have been organized in a way that is consistent with the corporate organization, how frequently different elements are accessed, and who needs to refer to the program.  The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location.  Therefore, for the purposes of auditing and regulatory review the following table is provided to provide concordant information regarding the program and the required regulatory elements. \n\n1.

At the Federal level, Title 40 CFR Part 68), and California OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Sanger Poultry business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nSanger Poultry operates a processing plant and freezer for poultry products.  Our facility has one ammonia system which holds a charge of 10,000 lbs.  The system provides refrigerating capacity to one freezer room, one shell & tube water chiller and two ice makers.\n\nThe systems operate as follows.  High pressure liquid from our main receiver is piped to each refrigeration zone, where i"
