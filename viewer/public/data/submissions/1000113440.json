This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Dauphin County LEPC which provides emergency response expertise.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around food storage and distribution. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility. All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release:\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA \"RMP*COMP\" as well as the EPA \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\". The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source\n\n- Process Safety Information \nUNFI maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the proces"

The analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n- Operating Procedures \nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, UNFI maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process. \n\n- Training\n UNFI has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\n - Mechanical Integrity \nUNFI carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and compressors. Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a background in maintenance practices. Training is provided to the personnel as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n- Management of Change \nWritten procedures are in place at UNFI to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes. \n\n- Pre-startup Reviews \nPre-start up safety reviews related to new proc"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n - Compliance Audits \nUNFI conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n - Incident Investigation \nUNFI promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \n\n- Employee Participation \nUNFI truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n - Contractors \nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. UNFI has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\nUNFI has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.

The plan includes aspects of emergency response such as evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Only authorized outside personnel (fire department, EMS, etc.) may perform emergency rescue and medical duties. The Dauphin County LEPC is the agency with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Continued training, and program reviews are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility. These changes are expected to be implemented in a timely manner."
