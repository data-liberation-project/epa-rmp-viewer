The North Attleboro Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) is committed to operating the plant in an environmentally responsible manner and to provide a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  The plant has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases.  The plant has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the plant to respond to potential releases.\n\nB. The plant treats wastewater collected from the towns of North Attleborough and Plainville, Massachusetts.  Wastewater is disinfected by chlorination (using gaseous chlorine).  Chlorine is the only substance at the plant present in quantities that exceed the RMP applicability threshold.\n\nC. The chlorination process at the plant is subject to the Program 2 Prevention Program and is subject to accidental release prevention programs related to: Safety Information; Hazard Review; Operating Procedures; Training; Maintenance; Incident Investigation; and Compliance Audits.\n\nD. There have been no incidents at the plant in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\nE. The plant has trained responders on-site for small releases and relies on the North Attleborough Fire Department and the North Attleboro Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for more extensive releases.\n\nF. The North Attleboro WWTF has a strong safety program at the plant.  Additional changes that have been implemented to improve safety at the plant include the installation of the new SCADA system."
