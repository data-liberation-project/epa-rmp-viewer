Chlorine is listed as a extremely hazardous substance by both EPA and OSHA. All Pennsylvania American Water facilities at or above the EPA threshold amount of 2500 pounds of chlorine is subject to the EPA CAAA regulations and will comply.\n\n\n\nBy this narrative we incorporate by reference all aspects of the Pennsylvania American Water Process Safety Management Program (PSM) including but not limited to Hazard Assessments, Prevention Programs, Emergency Response Programs and the American Water System Risk Management Manual.  \n\n\n\nEach Treatment Plant covered by the EPA RMP Guidleines is also covered by the OSHA PSM program. A PSM manual and a American Water System Risk Management Manual is available at each plant location for review.\n\n  \n\nAll Emergency Response procedures are included at the Treatment Plant. Procedures involving evacuation of the plant are included. Procedures involving the emergency response to a chemical release are located at the plant and all plant personnel are trained in the appropriate action to be taken. Procedures involving communication and evacuation of the public are deferred to the Local Emergency Management Agency or the local agency responsible for emergency coordination.\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan and Process Safety Management plan have been reviewed and updated on March 26, 2018 by Sharon R. Tanner"
