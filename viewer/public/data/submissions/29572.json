      "SummaryText": "The City of Baytown has incorporated a low risk approach to chemical safety. We have implemented safety procedures over the past years to reduce the posibilities of chemical releases. We also have a commitment to review our policies and procedures periodically to improve our safety program.  The City's wastewater treatment facilities use the chemical Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide as part of its process for disinfection of treated wastewater and for removal of residual chlorine before it is discharged to the river or bay. The wastewater facilities do not manufacture the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide. The chemicals are ordered from an outside company and brought by truck to the facilities in 2000 pound steel containers designed specifically for these chemicals. Each site usually stores one to four containers of each chemical. The Worst Case and Alternate scenarios in the City's program were developed using the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plant (40 CFR Part 68). A Worst Case scenario would be a castastrophic failure of all safety systems and no response from trained emergency responders. This scenario consists of a 2000 pound container releasing its entire chemical within a ten minute period. This scenario would have a chemical plume that could reach up to 1.3 miles and possibly have an offsite impact. The Worst Case scenario is unlikely to happen because of several safety system in place. First, the chemical containers are inspected by the company that supplies the chemicals to assure they meet safety specifications designed for those containers. Second, the system used to draw the chemical  out of the containers are a total vacuum system. The systems have a vacuum regulator valve attached to the container that is designed to shut off automatically in the event there is a break in the system stopping any release of the chemical. Third, the vacuum system is formally inspected by trained operators once every th"

Fourth, in the event a leak occurs due to a failure of all safety systems, we have operators on call that are trained in the first response to stop or minimize the leak. These operators also have links to off-site responders such as the Hazardous Material Team from the company that supplies the chemicals and the local Fire Department. The alternate scenario would consist of a leak of chlorine due to tubing failure or failure of a connection valve. The total release of this scenario would be 111 pounds in a three minute period. The distantance the gas would  travel is 0.1 miles under normal wind conditions and could have an off-site impact. This scenario is unlikely to happen because of the same safety systems in place as listed in the worst Case Scenario. Another Alternate Scenario would consist of a leak of Sulfur Dioxide due to tubing failure,or failure of a connection valve. The total release of this scenario would be 54 pounds in a three minute period. The distance the gas would travel is 0.1 mile under normal wind conditions and could have an off-site impact. Because the Sulfur Dioxide systems are identical to the Chlorine system, this scenario is unlikely to happen because of the same safety systems in place as both chlorine senarios. Through careful handling practices and safe procedures using these gases, the City has never had an accident. The City has a training program in place for the operators at all of its wastewater treatment plants. The operators have hands-on training exercises every three months using the leak repair equipment, and personal protective equipment. The operators also have communication links with the Fire Department, which has access to the emergency siren alert system. The alert system is a set of sirens stationed in various areas around town that are used by the City and Industy to alert citizens in the event of a chemical release. When the si"
