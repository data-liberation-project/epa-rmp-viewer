      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment. They are transported on roads, water, and railways. We at the Sun City West Water Reclamation Plant (SCWWRP) use chemicals, too. For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe water discharges to the environment or for landscaping or irrigation uses.  Chlorine is also used at the SCWWRP for odor control. Storing large quantities of chlorine can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine seriously.  Because chlorine is present at the facility in quantities over the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds, the SCWWRP is subject to the EPA's Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe SCWWRP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices. We adhere to all applicable procedures of the RMP Prevention Program, including key elements such as training, process safety, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThis document complies with the EPA's Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the CAA Amendments of 1990, 40 CFR Part 68.  The SCWWRP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine 1-ton containers. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The SCWWRP is a nonresponder, therefore, outs"

      "SummaryText": "ide personnel (the Sun City West Fire Department) will be used to respond to accidental releases.\n\nGENERAL FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES INFORMATION\n\nThe SCWWRP, operating since 1979, is located at 11102 West Rose Garden Lane in Sun City, Arizona.  The plant is northwest of the intersection of 111th Avenue and Beardsley Road. The SCWWRP  is a 3.14 million gallons per day (MGD) secondary treatment facility (to be converted to a tertiary treatment facility in January 2000) using bar screens, a preaeration basin, and two separate process trains consisting of primary clarifiers, trickling filters, and final clarifiers. The two trains are designed to treat 2.14 MGD and 1.0 MGD each.  \n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under RMP.  Chlorine is stored in six 1-ton containers on-site. At any given time, three containers are in the outside, covered Chlorine Container Storage Area and three are connected to the chlorination process in the Chlorination Room. This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP of 2,500 pounds.  \n\nGaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the containers for use in the chlorination process.  A chlorine leak detector monitors continuously for leaks in the Chlorination Room.  Other alarms include feed malfunction and low bulk storage tank weight.  These alarms are annunciated in the computerized operating system (SCADA). In the event of a chlorine leak in the Chlorination Room, an audible alarm will sound. Additionally, the SCADA system will dial out to a predetermined list of telephone numbers. It will continue to dial the numbers until the alarm has been acknowledged. The chlorination process also has various rupture disks and a pressure relief valve that will reduce the potential for a major accident in the Chlorination Room.\n\nThe Chlorination Room is equipped with an automatically operated ventilation system that operates when the chlorine leak monitor detects 0.5 ppm of chlorine in the room.

      "SummaryText": "ergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at the building just west of the Chlorination Room . \n\nVisitors to the SCWWRP enter through the South Gate located off Beardsley Road. The gate is unlocked during normal business hours and locked when the facility is unmanned. The SCADA system will notify on-call staff during off-hours of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations.     \n\nWhen the SCWWRP is fully converted to a tertiary treatment facility in January 2000, the facility will have a manually operated emergency generator that will supply power to the leak detectors and ventilation system.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as worst case and alternative release scenarios. The worst-case scenario requires that that single largest chlorine vessel or pipe be evaluated for off-site impacts.\n\nOnly passive or administrative controls are allowed under the worst case scenario to reduce off-site impacts. Also, the regulations require that the worst case scenario assume atmospheric conditions that are conservative and result in large impact areas.\n\nThe worst case scenario used for the SCWWRP assumes that the entire contents of the largest single container are released, regardless of how improbable that may be. Only passive mitigation methods such as buildings or dikes (for liquids) can be considered. Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human input. The SCWWRP has an onsite inventory of six 1-ton containers. According to the RMP rule, the worst case scenario must assume a release of the entire contents of the single largest container over a period of 10 minutes. The worst case scenario release rate for SCWWRP is 200 lb/min based on the release of an entire 1-ton container in 10 minutes.  Since the Chlorine Container Storage area is located outside, no mitigating factors were included in the analysis.\n\nThe con"

      "SummaryText": "tainer release could be caused by dropping a container during transport or unloading. The released liquid is assumed to quickly volatilize and to disperse as a vapor cloud. The release was modeled using the EPA-approved Dense Gas Release Model (DEGADIS) Breeze Haz\u00e4 DEGADIS+ 2.0. The DEGADIS+ model is applicable to continuous and instantaneous releases and to jet releases of gases or aerosols. The model simulates only one set of specified meteorological conditions and is not considered applicable over periods longer than 1 or 2 hours. It is, however, appropriate for the short-term releases modeled for the worst case scenario. DEGADIS is an EPA-recognized dispersion model for use with risk management planning.\n\nThe toxic endpoint was conservatively set by the EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surround-ing the release point.  In practice this type of total release of an entire container would be unlikely to occur during the lifetime of the plant.  The toxic endpoint selected by the EPA was 3 ppm.  In addition all required EPA-model input parameters where included in com-pleting this activity, including conservative meteorological conditions - Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, highest daily maximum temperature (117degree\u00b0F), and average humidity (37 percent).  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is more possible release scenario than the worst-case release scenario.  Based on the process hazard analysis (PHA) performed on the chlorine system an alternative scenario was selected.  Unlike the worst-case release scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize the leak or impacts.  Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input.  The scenario for the chlorine process was a vacuum regulator release causing a ch"

Although the chlorinators and  associated piping are all in a building, the release would be vented outside, so building mitigation was not considered.  Under this scenario, the amount of chlorine released was calculated to be 31.9 lbs/min for a period of 30 minutes.  The same modeling approach was used as for the worst case release scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to more common conditions of Stability D Class, wind speed of 5.6 meters per second, average air temperature of 75\u00b0F, and average humidity of 37 percent. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the alternative release scenario indicate an offsite impact.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe SCWWRP is in compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) require-ments. Chemical-specific prevention steps include awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\n\nThe SCWWRP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\u00b7 Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\n\u00b7 Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors\n\u00b7 Comprehensive preventive maintenance program\n\u00b7 Completed a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review\n\u00b7 Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with operations and maintenance staff participation\n\u00b7 High level of training of operators and maintenance staff\n\u00b7 Implementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff\n\nPROCESS AND CHEMICAL SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nComprehensive chemical data have been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health haz"

This information was compiled from numerous sources and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data about chlorine. This information includes chlorine background information, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), and chlorine reaction chemistry.\n\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine process.  Specifications for the process are collected in one place for easy reference. Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\n\nWe also have procedures in place that trigger updates to safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nA PHA was performed in April 1999 by an interdisciplinary team with expertise in engineering and process operations. This team included SCWWRP staff with experience and knowledge specific to the process, and a facilitator knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology being used.  Prior to conducting the PHA, a brief training session was provided to PHA team members. This training provided an overview of the regulatory background, process safety information, PHA methodology, and objectives. Based on the complexity of the chlorine process, the What-If Analysis method was selected for evaluating potential accidental releases, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The PHA was lead by a knowledgeable person on the type of process being reviewed. This review will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of actions to resolve any identified significant hazard review findings was prepared and staff is currently working to resolve this action item list.  Staff will document completion of any action"

The SCWWRP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the process. Procedures include startup, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operation (same as normal operation).  Also included is maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to avoid deviations. SCWWRP will update procedures whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Operating procedures will be developed and in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or a changed process starting up again.\n\nOPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING PROGRAM\n\nEach SCWWRP employee presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine process is trained in an overview of the process and detailed, applicable operating and maintenance procedures. In fact, SCWWRP helps their employees understand through training, the nature and cause of problems arising from operations involving chlorine and to increase their employees awareness with respect to their hazards. The SCWWRP's training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers 1) a general overview of the processes, 2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and 3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written self-evaluations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the process work can be resumed. \n\nTraining documentation includes: date of most recent review or revision to the training program, type of training required and the type of competency testing used to ensure staff understan"

The SCWWRP sets minimum contractor safety performance requirements to do work at the SCWWRP, holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area; controls access to the process areas, and evaluate the contractor's performance.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW AND MECHANICAL INTEGRITY PROGRAM\n\nThe SCWWRP ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any regulated process at the plant, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information. The SCWWRP maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. The SCWWRP believes that this program is the primary line of defense against a release and addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The SCWWRP's mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n\u00b7 Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes, and prior operating experience\n\u00b7 Implementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals\n\u00b7 Training of maintenance personnel in procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions\n\u00b7 Procedures specifying training requirements for contract maintenance employees, as well as requiring contractors to use plant developed ma"

The SCWWRP uses a comprehensive permitting and training program to ensure hot work is conducted safely.  \nThe SCWWRP has a procedure for implementing any management of changes or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions. This system allows SCWWRP employees to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or require training to be completed.\n\nINTERNAL COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP. The SCWWRP assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe SCWWRP investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be pre-vented.  SCWWRP trains employees to identify and report any incident that requires invest-igation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff, added or used to revise operating and mainte"

A vacuum regulator on one of the chlorinators failed causing a small amount of chlorine to be vented outside the building.  Two employees who were passing by the vented area were affected, but no life threatening injuries occurred on or off-site.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM SUMMARY\n\nThe SCWWRP is a nonresponder to releases of chlorine at the facility.  In the event of a release, SCWWRP employees will contact the Sun City West Fire Department. This program includes an emergency response notification plan for notifying the Sun City West Fire Department, the Local Emergency Planning Commission (Maricopa County), and the National Response Center, if necessary.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the 1999 PHA, several changes were identified to improve the safety of the chlorination systems.  It is expected that the recommended actions be evaluated and, if determined necessary, implemented by December 1999.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the covered processes.   These recommendations include conducting annual refresher training on selected operating and maintenance procedures to reduce the potential for releases."
