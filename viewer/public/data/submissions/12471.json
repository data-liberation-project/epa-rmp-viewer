These\nregulations mandate the investigation of potential accident scenarios which could effect\non-site and offsite private, public and environmental receptors. The scenarios prescribed\nfor investigation include both a worst-case and an alternative release which could\npossibly occur at the Southeastern Adhesives ( SEACO) facilities.\n\na)SEACO, under its present Senior Management, has adopted a pro-active approach to\nchemical safety by instituting a chemical accidental release policy governing all\nchemicals present at our stationary sources. This policy addresses the safe handling and\nstorage of all process chemicals and products, as well as, chemicals used in the day to\nday operations of our facility and it allows for the monitoring of safe practices,\nprocedures and conditions with daily visual inspections of all process and storage areas.\nIf an emergency situation should ever occur, SEACO's emergency response plan would\nbe initiated. Designated, trained response teams and individuals would proceed with the\nappropriate actions which are spelled out in the emergency plan, thus ensuring the safety\nof its employees, surrounding neighbors, and environment. SEACO's emergency\nresponse plan has been coordinated with the Henry County Local Emergency Planning\nCommittee and should provide the necessary factors, such as communication, spill\nresponse and clean up, etc., to facilitate proper and safe response to any emergency\nsituation which should arise at the SEACO stationary source.\n\nBoth SEACO's \"Accidental Release Plan\" and \"Emergency Response Plan\" are contained\nin its general Programs and Policies Manual.\n \nb) SEACO owns and op"

We use a batch process where these\nchemicals along with others are measured by weight and charged to a 10,000 gallon\nreactor.  Through a series of pH and temperature adjustments and controls, the final UF\nproduct is obtained.  All process steps are monitored for proper operation and all are\nunder the constant supervision of trained personnel.  These resins are then stored in bulk\nand shipped in appropriate containers.  To the best of our understanding the facilities are\ncompliant with all applicable State and Federal Regulations.   \n\nSEACO has determined from the substances listed pursuant to section 112(r)(3) of the\nClean Air Act and its amendment SS68.130 List of  Regulated Toxic Substances and\nTheir Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention that it houses only one\nregulated substance in quantities at or above the given \"threshold quantities\": \nFORMALDEHYDE, held in maximum quantity (at any one time) of 103,000. pounds.\nat the Ridgeway, VA plant (stationary source).

In the event of such a\nlarge scale spill, there is a passive mitigation diking system consisting of a large dike and\nsump area. The diked area alone has a capacity of over 13,000 gallons and is therefore\nlarge enough to contain the entire contents of a worst-case scenario spill in a relatively\nsmall surface area pool and the formaldehyde would be recovered by pumping into\ntanker trucks or holding tanks and held until the main storage unit was repaired or\nreplaced.  According to the EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (a document\nprovided by the Federal EPA to assist industry in the preparation of their\nRMP), such an accident might warrant evacuation of the stationary source and\nnotification of appropriate emergency response agencies who are designated to respond\nto any potential crisis situation. \n\nThe following worst case scenario parameters were used in determining the data included\nin this RMP:\n\t-52,000lbs. formaldehyde released [50% by weight concentration in water,\n \t   11,000 gallons @ 50 - 65 degrees centigrade.

A run-away reaction would not result in the release of 100% of the 50%\nformaldehyde solution charged to the reactor.

Both the heat and the lower pH add to the instability of the reaction.\nTherefore, as the reaction proceeds and more formaldehyde reacts with urea, the process\nbecomes more unstable and the possibility of a runaway reaction increases but the\navailability of unreacted formaldehyde decreases.  It is also unlikely that all the reaction\nmixture would escape from the large vessel through its relatively small (24 inch) mouth,\nas the reaction vessel is never intentionally filled to capacity.

This program is designed to be pro-active and is\ntherefore, constantly evolving with improvements to our safety program being a top\npriority. At present, SEACO also maintains specific prevention steps for many of the\nchemicals present at our facility. Chem-specific guidelines address proper training,\nhandling and storage, clean-up and disposal methods prescribed by OSHA, EPA, and\nother industry specific agencies.  Inspections and monitoring of all the\nformaldehyde transfer and delivery into storage and process reaction vessels, weight\ndifferential transfer systems for raw material delivery to reaction vessel, manual shut-offs\nof piping delivery,  etc., equipment inspection, maintenance and daily visual inspections\nof on-site storage, processes, equipment and overall conditions helps to ensure the early\ndetection of any accidental release at this SEACO facility.\n\ne) A review of accidental releases over the past five (5) years reveals one potentially\nsignificant leak of formaldehyde. During a daily visual inspection by the facilities\nmanager it was noted that a large quantity of 50% formaldehyde in water had leaked  into\nthe diked area surrounding the storage tank. This solution was pumped into a tanker truck\nas was the remaining formaldehyde solution in the storage tank. Investigation revealed\nthat the old storage tank was made from inappropriate material and years of corrosion\nhad produced a hole in the tank. This storage tank was replaced on 04/17/99 with a\nstainless steel tank that meets the requirements for formaldehyde storage.  No complaints\nwere received as a result of this incident.  As per (40CFR 68.42) no known on-site\ndeaths, injuries, or significant property damage or known offsite deaths, injuries,\nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage occurred as\na result of this incident; therefore, it does not constitute an \"accidental release\".\n\nf"

      "SummaryText": ")  In detail, SEACO's \"Emergency Response Program\" contains pertinent information\ndealing with the procedures to follow if an emergency situation should present itself.\nThe program covers in-house emergency response procedures and designated responders\nand their duties, emergency action procedures, pertinent phone numbers of responsible\ncompany personnel and community emergency responders, next of kin notification\ninformation, a fire prevention program with locations of all extinguishers, site map with\ndesignated evacuation routes and exits, personnel and medical information and\nprocedures. In case of emergency the following personnel should be contacted:\n   \tDoug Stewart, Plant Manager\t\t\t\t(540) 956-3176 or (540)629-1449 (emergency, after hours)\n\tDon Barrier, President\t\t\t\t(828) 754-3493 or (828)754-8371 (emergency, after hours)\n\tElwood Duncan, Assistant Plant Manager\t\t(540) 956-3176 or (540)956-5319 (emergency, after hours)\n\tNancy Feimster, Safety & Environment\t\t(828) 754-3493 or (828)757-9387 (emergency, after hours)\n\ng) The safety of our personnel and facilities, our surrounding neighbors, and our\nenvironment is a top priority for SEACO. We are constantly monitoring our situations\nfor potential problems and seeking solutions. Our \"Safety Committee\" conducts monthly\ninspections and at present we are concerned with increasing the size of our passive\nmitigation diked area (by adding a foot in height to the total perimeter of the dike) so it,\nin conjunction with the attached sump area will contain the total contents of both\nformaldehyde storage tanks. SEACO is also making improvements to drainage and run-\noff of areas with increased potential for accidental spills and releases."
