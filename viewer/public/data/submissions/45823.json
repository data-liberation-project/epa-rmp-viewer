      "SummaryText": "This RMP has been prepared as an update to the initial plan developed in 1999.  Most elements of that initial RMP remain unchanged today.  Release scenarios were verified using the updated RMP Comp (v1.07) software.  The facility, including its equipment and safety measures were inspected, with most previous process hazard analysis recommendations verified as having been implemented.\n\nThe Town of Danvers Water Treatment Plant, located in Middleton, MA treats an average of 3.2 million gallons of water a day.  The facility operates two shifts most of the year with a third shift added during periods of highest water demand.  One step in the treatment process is chlorination in which chlorine is used as a pre-oxidant for water entering the plant and a disinfectant for water leaving the plant.  The amount of chlorine used varies seasonally as a function of the water quality entering the treatment plant and the demand for water.\n\nSignificant changes to the treatment process have been anticipated since 2001.  The Town of Danvers has conducted pilot studies for the use of chloramines, chlorine dioxide, and ozone as alternative disinfectants to chlorine gas.  Furthermore, a major Capital Improvement Planning process is underway to apply the results of those studies and reassess the entire treatment plant process, including the use of gaseous chlorine.  The CIP is expected to result in significant changes to the treatment process and facility configuration.\n\nThe chlorination process consists of two 1-ton cylinders with an automatic switching mechanism to transfer withdrawals from an empty cylinder to a full cylinder.  There are also up to four additional cylinders in storage.  Chlorine is the only hazardous chemical used at the facility above the threshold for the RMP rules.  The facility has never had a chlorine related injury or emergency incident.  The system design incorporates several important safety features to minimize risk of release including (1) only gaseous chlori"

      "SummaryText": "ne is withdrawn from the cylinders, (2) the system for injecting gaseous chlorine into the water operates under a vacuum so that if any line failed, the flow of chlorine from the cylinder would be stopped, and (3) a chlorine leak detector operates continuously in the chlorine room.\n\nThe worst case and alternative case scenarios were developed in accordance with the chlorine guidance provided in the Guidance Document for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40CFR Part 68), EPA 550-B-98-010.  As prescribed, the worst case release scenario is represented by the rupture of a 1-ton cylinder such that the entire contents are released in a 10-minute period.  It further assumes the release occurs outdoors.  A release of this magnitude is very unlikely based on cylinder design and precautions employed during unloading and handling of the cylinders.\n\nFive alternative release scenarios were evaluated, including the failure of a valve and the rupture of a fuse plug.  The distance to the prescribed toxic use endpoint for these scenarios ranged from less than 0.1 miles to 0.4 miles.\n\nThe process hazard analysis was conducted using the checklist developed by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) as used in the initial process hazard analysis in 1999.  Additional emphasis is recommended for documentation of training and maintenance."
