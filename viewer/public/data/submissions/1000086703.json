It is the Sewerage Commission's policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment. As part of this policy, the Sewerage Commission has established systems to facilitate safe operation of the process at this facility. One element of this system is preparation and submittal of a risk management plan (RMP) in conformance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. The Wastewater Treatment Facility is categorized as a Program 2 facility.\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility operates a process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115. The process is defined as the disinfection and dechlorination of wastewater. The Wastewater Treatment Facility has over the threshold quantities of 2,500 pounds (lbs) for chlorine and 5,000 lbs for sulfur dioxide on site. An offsite consequence analysis shows that the release of a toxic chemical has an endpoint which would reach a public receptor. However, since the facility is not subject to OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 or does not have a qualifying NAICS code, the facility is assigned a Program 2 designation.\n\n\n\n2.0    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the plant workers, the public, and the environment. The Wastewater Treatment Facility strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility. Th"

The facility has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the process at this facility. One part of these systems is the risk management program which helps manage the risks at the facility and complies with the requirements of the 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at the facility. \n\n\n\nThis document satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and provides the public with a description of the risk management program at The Wastewater Treatment Facility.\n\n\n\n2.1    Develop and Implement a Management System (40 CFR 68.15)\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Operator at facility is responsible for the development and implementation of the RMP and process safety management for the facility. However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program are delegated to other personnel who report either directly or through other management personnel. \n\n\n\n2.2    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nProgram 2 requires the compilation of up-to-date safety information related to the regulated substances, process, and equipment. The seven elements listed below are part of a general accidental release prevention program, which are detailed in subsequent sections:\n\n\n\n?    Safety Information\n\n?    Hazard Review\n\n?

SDS's for chlorine and sulfur dioxide are maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to enhance safety features in the process.\n\n\n\n2.2.2    Hazard Review (40 CFR 68.50)\n\n\n\nThe facility uses the hazard review to ensure that hazards associated with the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process are identified and controlled. Hazard reviews are performed on an established schedule of every five years.\n\n\n\nThe hazard review provides a means for determining if the process is designed and operated in accordance with standard industry codes and federal and/or local regulations. The review requires a documented inspection of the process and operating procedures to ensure compliance. The hazard review must be updated, at a minimum, every five years or after major process changes. A copy of a hazard review checklist provided in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants is included in the Risk Management Plan document maintained at the facility. This checklist is used to perform Hazard Reviews at the facility.\n\n\n\n2.2.3    Operating Procedures (40 CFR 68.52)\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

New employees receive basic training in facility operations. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \n\n\n\n2.2.5    Maintenance (40 CFR 68.56)\n\n\n\nEquipment is inspected monthly and maintained in accordance with manufacturers' or suppliers' specifications. Specific maintenance instructions are maintained at the facility. A maintenance action form is used to schedule activities outside of the regularly scheduled events. Personnel involved in maintenance are trained in proper safety and operational procedures. Documentation is kept on file for dates and actions completed during maintenance, as well as management oversight of maintenance activities. \n\n\n\n2.2.6    Compliance Audit (40 CFR 68.58)\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the facility conducts audits to confirm the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are correct and robust. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. The audit team is assembled with either internal personnel or third-party auditors and at least one person who is knowledgeable in the process. These audits are documented onsite. The findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.
