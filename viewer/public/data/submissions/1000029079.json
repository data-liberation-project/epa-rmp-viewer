Neches Facility (The Facility) processes approximately 900,000 cubic feet per day of natural gas from producing wells completed in the Woodbine Formation at depths between 4,600 and 4,800 feet.  The process involves the removal of hydrocarbon liquids (NGL) from the feed gas and treatment of the gas to remove water from the gas stream.  The Facility processes approximately 900,000 cubic feet of natural gas per day.  The NGL is stored in a 24,480 gallon pressurized tank. The NGL is removed from the Facility by transfers to tank trucks.  Approximately 3,000 gallons of NGL are produced per day.\n\n\n\nThe system is inspected on a daily basis and preventative maintenance is performed as required.\n\n\n\nThe EPA-approved model, RMPComp was used to calculate the distance to endpoint of a vapor cloud explosion with an estimated distance to 0.1 pounds per square inch (psi) overpressure.  The resultant distance was 0.4 miles, a distance which includes four residential buildings housing approximately eight people.\n\n\n\nAn alternative case scenario was identified and described in the off-site consequence analysis by the process hazard analysis team.  The distance to endpoint for the alternative case was 211 feet, which is within the confines of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, and a PSM plan is in place.\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no major accidents associated with the process.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response for the stationary source include safe operating procedures and a well trained work force.  The process itself is equipped with appropriate pressure relief devices, manual and automatic shutoffs, and grounding equipment.\n\n\n\nAt this time, there are no specific planned changes for safety associated with the process.  Should opportunities to improve safety become available, the Facility will thoroughly review"
