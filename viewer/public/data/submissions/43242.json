      "SummaryText": "GENERAL EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR GIUMARRA VINEYARDS COLD STORAGE FACILITIES\r\n\r\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Giumarra Vineyards are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass fruit packing and cold storage operations.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance includes Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for refrigeration.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 26368.00 lbs. divided between two cold storage unit operations.  The total amount held at the south cold storage facility is 10948 pounds, while the north cold storage facility holds 15420 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration/South.  In this scenario 16000 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.   At Class F atmospheric sta"

In this scenario 12000 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.    At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.42 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia Refrigeration/South.  The scenario involves the release of 8000 lbs. of ammonia.  The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 30 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of minimizing the release of ammonia to the atmosphere.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.18 miles.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia Refrigeration/North.  The scenario involves the release of 6000 lbs. of ammonia.  The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 20 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of minimizing the release.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).    Under neutral weather conditions, the m"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nGiumarra Vineyards maintains records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of annually.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed in May of 2004.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Giumarra Vineyards maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nGiumarra Vineyards has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these p"
