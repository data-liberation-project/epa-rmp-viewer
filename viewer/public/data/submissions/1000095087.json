This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility. It is our goal to implement appropriate control\n\nmeasures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe facility's primary activities encompass vegetable processing and storage. We have 1 regulated substances( Anhydrous Ammonia) present at our facility. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to efficiently cool process water and cool air in the cold storages.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and\n\nthe RMP-COMP calculation program.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nThe facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the c"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What-if. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: \n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating process equipment are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as necessary.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nThe Facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks of process equipment to ensue proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes\n\namong other: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. The timing of their inspections follow the recommended guidelines available form the manufacturer, the International of Ammonia Refrigeration. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.\n\nAny equipment deficiencies identifies by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Facility to manage changes in process chemical, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe\n\nstartup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nThe Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nThe Facility promptly investigated any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading into the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nThe Facility truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilities implementation of the RMP rule, including information from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
