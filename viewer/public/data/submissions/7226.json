The policies and procedures implemented at Z.F.C. are to help eliminate the possibility of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from our process. We feel the best way to prevent the occurence of an accidental release is by constant maintenance to ensure all equipment and machines are functioning properly and the implementation of our Process Safety Managment program. In the event a piece of equipment or machine becomes faulty or is in the condition which increases the possibility of a release, that piece of equipment or machine shall  be repaired or replaced  promptly.\n      It is important to staff personel who are properly trained in dealing with the type of equipment involved in our refrigeration system. Daily monitoring of machines is also part of our procedure in the attempt to minimize the posibility of an accidental release. As part of the operating procedures at ZFC we monitor, maintain and repair all aspects of the Ammonia system as to meet or exceed PSM standards and manufacturer requirements to maintain machanical and system integrity.       \n     In the event of an emergency, such as an ammonia release, our employees are instructed to evacuate. Our evacuation plan is posted on the safety bulletin board. Through monthly safety meetings employees are also educated on the evacuation plan. This training includes- knowledge of all exit doors to be used in emergency situations, designated meeting spots and accounting for emplyees.\n    Our emergency responce team is the Selah Fire Dept. Our maintenance supervisor shall be the emergency contact person to communicate with the fire dept. Employees at Z.F.C. are not trained in emergency response for fire fighting or release of toxic substance. Our concern is to protect employees by way of evacuation and get them to a spot which is safe for employees to be. We shall continue to consult and work closely with the Selah Fire Dept. and ex"

The Selah Fire Dept. and local law enforcement, along with the Local Emergency Planning Committee ( L.E.P.C.), shall determine the method of alerting the public of an accidental release and the need to evacuate residences with in the calculated boundry to the toxic end point. This is usually done by emergency broadcasting on local television and radio along with door to door notification by emergency personnel and law enforcement officials. \n    Zirkle Fruit Company is an apple packing facility. At this facility there are also \"Controlled Atmosphere rooms\" for storing fruit for long periods of time, as well as \"Common cold storage rooms\", which are used to store fruit that is waiting to be packed or shipped. Activities at Z.F.C. include storing, sorting, packing and shipping apples both domestic and export. Anhydrous Ammonia is used at our facility in the refrigeration system which is the key element used for the storage of apples. There are two engine rooms at this facility. They are referred to as the \"North Facility Engine Room and South Facility Engine Room\". The south facility has a quantity of 40,000 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia and the north facility has 25,000 lbs. We do not manufacture Anhydrous Ammonia at our facility, It is delivered to us.\n    We have had no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years. The materials of construction at this facility will meet or exceed requirments of State and Federal codes for an ammonia refrigeration system.\n     Aloha 5.2 was used to calculate data for our worst case scenario. It was determined that the vessel which is 8' wide and 15' long was the source of the leak. It developed a 2\" hole 1' from the bottom of the vessel. The chemical mass in the tank is 25,000 pounds and  the tank is 87% full. The release duration is 9 minutes. The max computed release rate is 5,100 pounds/min. The max average sustained release r"

      "SummaryText": "ate is 5,050 pounds/min ( averaged over a minute or more ). The total amount released is 23,667 pounds. The chemical escaped as a mixture of gas and aerosol ( two phase flow ). FOOTPRINT INFORMATION: Model run- heavy gas,  User-specified LOC- equals IDLH (300 ppm), Max threat zone for LOC- 2.1 miles east and .50 miles west with a wind of 1.5 mps from WNW.  TIME DEPENDENT INFORMATION: Concentration/Dose estimates at the point down wind 2 miles. Off centerline 1 mile. Max concentration outdoor 5.07 ppm, indoor 0.0697 ppm, Max dose (in the first hour ) outdoor 21.9 ppm-min. Through mapping, graphing and physically counting resedences, it was detirmined that aproximatly 2300 people would be affected by this worst case release scenario. \n      The risk of this worst case scenario actually occurring is highly unlikely. The vessel is located inside an engine room which is constructed of concrete. The vessel getting ruptuerd with a 2\" hole would only occur by being struck by a forklift or other vehicles, or fatigued metal in the vessel its self. There are no forklifts being used where the vessel is located and the materials of construction of the vessel will meet or exceed manufacturer specifications. These vessels are under six years old.\n     Aloha 5.2 was used to calculate data for the alternative scenario. It was determined that a 3\" pipe was severed. aloha limited the duration to 1 hour. The max computed release rate is 247 pounds/min. The average sustained release rate is 247 pounds/min( averaged over a minute or more). The total amount of Anydrous Ammonia released 14800 pounds in 1 hour. Footprint Information: Dispertion Module- Gaussian User-specified LOC- equals IDLH (300 ppm) Max threat Zone for LOC is 345 yards. This alternative scenario with WNW wind at 1.5 mps. would have no offsite consequence. If this scenario did occur, through auto valves and manual valves, the release could be controlled and the zone with the severed pipe isolated there for containing the "

Being informed and prepared will improve responce time and lessen the quantity of Ammonia released. In an effort for improved communication with Selah Fire Dept., the maintanence superviser, machine room operator, safety manager and compliance officer are trained in emergency response and incident command to have an understanding of the procedures involved with emergency response. This training is done annually. These employees are trained in emergency response, however, the Slah Fire Dept. is still our emergency response team."
