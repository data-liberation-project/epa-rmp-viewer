              "Description": "3.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Harris Teeter has a NAICS Code of 49312 (Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage Facilities) and is considered a ?Program 3? level prevention program as described in Subpart D of 40 CFR 68 (68.65 through 68.87).  The requirements for the prevention program are equivalent to the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.119(a) through (p), OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Harris Teeter is subject to PSM and has developed and implemented a PSM program. Development and implementation of a PSM program fulfills the requirements of the RMP prevention program.  Information for each PSM program element is maintained in three-ring binders and file cabinets in Harris Teeter?s PSM Library located in the Dry Goods Distribution Center.  The following summarizes information for each element.\n\n    3.1  Process Safety Information (40 CFR 68.65)  \n\nRMP process safety information requirements include compiling written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment.  \n\nCompiled chemical information must address:\n? toxicity\n? permissible exposure limits\n? physical data\n? reactivity\n? corrosivity\n? thermal and chemical stability\n? hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of materials that could foreseeably occur\n \n A material safety data sheet (MSDS) that includes this data may be used to meet this requirement.  Harris Teeter maintains a current MSDS for ammonia in the Process Safety Management Binder, in the PSM Library. \n \n Written information requirements for process technology includes compiling the following:\n? a block flow diagram or simplified process flow diagram\n? information on process chemistry\n? maximum intended inventory of the EPA-regulated substance\n? safe upper and lower limits for such items as temperature, pressure, flows, or composition \n? evaluation of the consequences of deviation\n \n Harris Teeter maintains this information in the Process Safety Management Binder in the PSM Library.\n \n Process equipment information for the facility includes:\n? materials of construction\n? piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs)\n? electrical classification\n? relief system design and design basis\n? ventilation system design\n? design codes and standards employed\n? safety systems \n? material and energy balances for new processes built after June 21, 1999\n \n The P&ID?s, electrical schematics and process equipment information are maintained in the Process Safety Management Binder, in the PSM Library.\n \n     3.2  Process Hazard Analysis (40 CFR 68.67)  \n \n An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on the refrigeration system in March 1999 and a revised analysis in June 2004.  The ?What-If? methodology was used to complete the PHA.  Extensive what-if scenarios were addressed using a brainstorming session.  \n \n During the initial PHA, the following hazards of operating an ammonia refrigeration system were identified:  \n - toxic release              - equipment failure\n - plane crash             - loss of cooling, heating, electricity, instrument air\n - overpressurization          - tornado\n - corrosion             - human factor\n\n\n In order to prevent / control the catastrophic release of ammonia, the following controls are in place at Harris Teeter:  \n  - vents             - alarms and procedures\n  - relief valves            - emergency power\n  - check valves        - emergency air supply \n  - manual shutoffs         - grounding equipment for the electrical system\n  - automatic shutoffs         - interlocks\n  - excess flow valve\n   \n To assist in mitigating a release, Harris Teeter uses the following systems:  \n  - sprinkler system \n  - fire walls\n  - blast walls    \n - enclosure\n - neutralization\n\n Harris Teeter has access to a 24-hour, off-site local hazardous materials (?Hazmat?) response team.\n \n To assist in detecting ammonia releases, Harris Teeter utilizes ammonia detectors, which are located throughout the plant, and are managed by the Ammonia Refigeration Technician and the Security Department.\n \n Results of the initial PHA were compiled in more detail and are maintained in the PSM library.  Changes required, as a result of the initial PHA, were identified and have been addressed.  Information relating to the past schedule for implementing all changes is maintained in the PSM Library, as well.\n Changes, which have been implemented as a result of the initial PHA, include:\n? inspection schedule for UPS service and other fire protection devices\n? windsocks were mounted\n? updates to ammonia training\n? changes to alarm procedures at guard gate\n \n The PHA will be updated pursuant to the applicable regulations every 5 years.\n \n     3.3  Operating Procedures (40 CFR 68.69)  \n \n Harris Teeter?s operating procedures must address the steps for each operating phase, the operating limits, safety and health considerations and safety systems and their functions.  \n \n Specific requirements are as follows:\n \n Steps for each \n Operating Phase     \n Operating Limits     Safety & Health Considerations     Safety Systems & \n Their Functions\n Initial startup\n Normal operations\n Temporary operations\n Emergency shutdown\n Emergency operations\n Normal shutdown\n Startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown\n Lockout/Tagout\n Confined space entry\n Opening process equipment or piping\n Entrance into the facility     Consequences of deviations\n Steps to avoid, correct deviations     Chemical properties and hazards\n Precautions for preventing chemical exposure\n Control measures for exposure\n QC for raw materials and chemical inventory     Address whatever is applicable\n \n Refrigeration system standard operating procedures (SOPs) were developed and are used by Harris Teeter?s refrigeration operators.  \n \n There are two sets of SOPs  - one copy is maintained in the PSM library and a second copy is kept in the refrigeration office.\n \n \n \n     3.4  Training (40 CFR 68.71) \n \n As required under PSM, training requirements for new operators at Harris Teeter includes training on operating procedures and must cover health and safety hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices applicable to the associate?s tasks.  The facility also determines that each operator has received and understood the training and keep a record for each employee with the date of the training and the method used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n \n The format of Harris Teeter?s PSM training program was last reviewed and revised by the PSM team in June 2004. \n \n Training materials include, computer software programs, videos, and existing refrigeration equipment SOPs.  The information is maintained in the PSM Library.   \n Harris Teeter?s training program consists of classroom review, written tests and hands-on sessions, where the procedures are reviewed ?in the field?.  Each operator participates in discussing the procedures and process safety information, while the facilitator notes any necessary changes and deficiencies.  Verification that the operators understood the material is accomplished through verbal questioning and hands-on demonstrations.  More detailed training documentation and information is maintained in the PSM Library.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\n \n     3.5  Mechanical Integrity (40 CFR 68.73)  \n \n As required by the regulations, Harris Teeter implements a mechanical integrity program for pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems and controls.  The program includes written procedures, training, inspection and testing, equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance.  \n \n The specific required provisions are as follows:\n \n? Written Procedures\n 1. establish & implement written procedures to maintain the integrity of process equipment\n? Training\n 1.  Train process maintenance employees in an overview of the process and its hazards\n 2.  Assure the training covers the procedures applicable to safe job performance\n? Inspection & Testing\n 1.  Inspect and test process equipment\n 2.  Use recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices\n 3.  Follow a schedule that matches the manufacturer?s recommendations or more frequently if prior operating experience indicates is necessary\n 4.  Document each inspection/test with: date, inspector name, equipment id, test or inspection performed, results\n? Equipment Deficiencies\n 1.  Correct equipment deficiencies before further use of process equipment or whenever necessary to ensure safety \n? Quality Assurance\n 1.    Establish a QA program for new construction and equipment, newly installed equipment, maintenance materials, and spare parts and equipment\n \n Harris Teeter follows a Mechanical Integrity program to assure system equipment integrity is maintained.  As part of the program, preventative maintenance of the equipment is scheduled, documented and managed by the Ammonia Refigeration Technician.  More detailed information relating to Harris Teeter?s mechanical integrity program can be found in the PSM Library, as well.\n \n     3.6  Management of Change (40 CFR 68.75)\n \n The regulatory definition of change includes all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than ?replacement in kind.?  PSM regulations require changes to be properly managed by identifying and reviewing them prior to implementation of  the change.  Management of change includes the following requirements:\n \n MOC Procedures\n must address:     Employees Affected by \n the Change Must:     Update Process Safety Information if:     Update Operating Procedures if:\n Technical basis for the change\n Impact on safety  & health\n Modifications to operating procedures\n Necessary time period for the change\n Authorization requirements for proposed change     Be informed of the change before startup\n Trained in the change before startup     A change covered by the MOC procedures results in a change in any PSI required under EPA?s rule (? 67.65)     A change covered by MOC procedures results in a change in any operating procedure required under EPA?s rule (? 67.69)\n \n To assure modifications to the refrigeration system (e.g., equipment, instrumentation, process condition modifications) will be managed in a safe and consistent manner, Harris Teeter has implemented a Management of Change program.  The program requires that certain PSM tasks, (such as updating operating procedures, training applicable personnel, updated piping and instrument diagrams, as well as other process safety information) be completed before the modification takes place.  \n \n The Management of Change procedures have not been required since their development.  Management of Change procedures and documentation are maintained in the PSM Library.\n \n     3.7  Pre-Startup Review (40 CFR 68.77)  \n \n Under the applicable regulations, a pre-startup safety review is required for new stationary sources or modified stationary sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the management of change element.  Specific requirements are outlined below.\n \n \n Design Specifications     Adequate Procedures     PHA/MOC     Training\n Confirm that new or modified construction and equipment meet design specifications     Ensure that procedures for safety, operating, maintenance, and emergencies are adequate and in place.     Perform a PHA and resolve or implement any recommendations for new process.  \n Meet MOC requirements for modified process.     Confirm that each employee involved in the process has been trained completely.\n \n \n \n In conjunction with the Management of Change program, a Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist is used at Harris Teeter to assure required tasks are completed before start-up of the modified system. The Pre-Startup Review documentation is maintained with the Process Safety Management Binder, in the PSM Library.  \n \n         3.8  Compliance Audits (40 CFR 68.79) \n \n Harris Teeter is required to conduct compliance audits every three (3) years.  The audit must include an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the process safety management system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that systems are effectively implemented.\n \n As required, Harris Teeter undergoes an audit every three (3) years.  The most recent compliance audit performed on Harris Teeter?s PSM program was performed in June 2002.  Recommendations made as a result of the audit included updates to emergency response procedures.  The last two (2) audit reports are kept in the PSM Library.\n \n     3.9  Incident Investigation (40 CFR 68.81)  \n \n Incident investigation is the process of identifying the underlying causes of incidents and implementing steps to prevent similar events from occurring.  RMP requires the investigation of each incident, which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  The specific requirements are as follows:\n \n? Initiate an investigation promptly, no later than 48 hours of the incident\n? Establish an incident investigation team with at least one team member knowledgeable in the process\n? Summarize the investigation in a report, including:\n a.  Date of incident\n b.  Date investigation began\n c.  Description of the incident\nd. Factors contributing to the incident\ne. Any recommendations\nf. Expected date of completion for recommendation or changes\n? Address and resolve the team?s findings and recommendations.  Document resolutions and corrective actions\n? Review the report with affected personnel, and contractors where applicable\n? Retain the report for five years\n? Submit RMP if necessary\n \n Harris Teeter has established incident investigation procedures as part of the PSM program for the ammonia refrigeration system.  These procedures can be found in the PSM Library.  \n \n     3.10  Employee Participation (40 CFR 68.83) \n \n Regulations require for employee participation in the prevention process, via the following: \n? Development of a written plan to implement employee participation\n? Consultation with employees regarding conducting and developing PHAs and other elements of process safety management\n? Providing access to PHAs and all RMP information to employees\n \n Harris Teeter has implemented an associate participation program consistent with PSM requirements.  Associates indirectly involved with the ammonia refrigeration process are informed of the facility?s PSM program through company newsletters, training sessions and new employee orientation.  Associates directly involved with the process participate in all elements of PSM, previously described.  The employee participation plan was last updated June 2002.\n \n     3.11  Hot Work Permit (40 CFR 68.85)  \n \n RMP regulations require that a hot work permit be issued for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  The permit must document that PSM fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to the beginning of the work.  It also must indicate the authorization date and identify the object on which the hot work is to be performed.  The permit must be kept on file until the hot work is completed.\n \n Harris Teeter?s Process Safety Management Coordinator presently manages the Hot Work Permit Program.  Program procedures are maintained with the PSM Library, as well as with the Maintenance Manager.  The procedures were last reviewed and updated in June 2002.\n \n     3.12  Contractors (40 CFR 68.87) \n \n Specific prevention requirements also apply to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.  The following separate requirements apply to the facility owner/operator as well as the contractor:\n \n \n \n \n \n Owner/Operator Requirements      Contractor Requirements\n Check safety performance regarding safety\n Provide safety and hazards information\n Ensure safe work practices, including emergency response\n Verify that the contractor is fulfilling its obligations under this rule     Ensure employee training in safe work practices\n Ensure employees know process hazards and applicable emergency actions\n Document training\n Ensure employees are following facility safety rules\n Inform owner/operator of hazards\n \n Harris Teeter contractors working near the ammonia refrigeration system are required to review Harris Teeter?s Contractor Rules packet, as well as sign-off that they will adhere to the policies and procedures contained in the packet.  Contractors working directly on the refrigeration system obtain additional training.  This documentation is maintained in the PSM Library.  The procedures were last reviewed in June 2002.\n \n Also, in February 1998, Harris Teeter?s Engineering Department began conducting contractor safety audits.  This assures the contractor employees are working in a safe and professional manner, in accordance with Harris Teeter?s policies and procedures.",

Perishable Foods Distribution submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Greensboro, North Carolina facility.  Harris Teeter?s operations include the warehousing of grocery products for public consumption. Harris Teeter has been in operation at this facility for 6 years providing quality grocery products and over 92 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nHarris Teeter is committed to protecting the health of its associates, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Harris Teeter?s policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nHarris Teeter is subject to section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.  Harris Teeter is required to maintain low temperatures in the food warehousing areas of the facility that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the delivered products.  Harris Teeter uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain 173,000 ft2 within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is a typical refrigerant for food warehousing. Harris Teeter?s refrigeration system consisting of receivers, a thermosyphon, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping can contain a maximum amount of 12,410 pounds of anhydrous ammoni"

      "SummaryText": "a.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, And Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Harris Teeter has implemented several precautionary measures.  \n\nHarris Teeter has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, check valves, excess flow device, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, interlocks, emergency power and air, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Harris Teeter has spent time with the local Hazmat team who would respond to potential ammonia releases and the Hazmat team has toured the facility to become familiar with the location of the system equipment, valves and emergency shut-offs.\n\nHarris Teeter has developed standard operating procedures (SOP) for all associates and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system, that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an as-needed basis. Process safety information for the refrigeration system is reviewed anytime there is a change in the process or SOP.  Harris Teeter requires associate participation in development of overall safety measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters, total quality management teams and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Harris Teeter, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\nHarris Teeter understands that maintaining the refrige"

      "SummaryText": "ration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Harris Teeter has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed by the Ammonia Refigeration Technician to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system. \n\nTo ensure that Harris Teeter?s control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\n\n? In accordance with the PSM program, Harris Teeter conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years that incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n \n? In addition, Harris Teeter is audited by the parent company?s (Ruddick Corporation) Corporate Environmental Manager, Corporate Environmental Engineer and Corporate Safety Manager on an annual basis.\n \n? Harris Teeter?s insurance carrier also conducts independent audits on an annual\n      basis.\n\n? The State of North Carolina Department of Labor, Boiler Safety Bureau conducts an assessment on the pressure vessels every two years.\n\n? The USDA audits the facility on an annual basis.\n \n Five-Year Accident History\n \n Over the last five years, Harris Teeter has not experienced an accidental off-site release of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system.\n \n \n Emergency Response Program\n \n Harris Teeter has documented emergency response procedures in three documents entitled Special Situation Manual, Emergency Evacuation Program and Emergency Response Plan in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an on-site or off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the doc"

      "SummaryText": "uments are measures to be taken internally by Harris Teeter as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n \n Harris Teeter has no on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases. Personnel that work on the ammonia system receive initial training and update training every 3 years or as needed reviewing safe work practices.  These associates are also trained in the proper use of respirators and receive an annual fit test and initial pulmonary function test to aid in passive mitigation.\n \n To assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Harris Teeter?s emergency response procedures, Harris Teeter has met with the local fire department and Hazmat team. \n \n To plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Harris Teeter includes procedures/equipment to passively mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n \n In addition to the local response agencies, Harris Teeter has arranged emergency response assistance with a local clean-up contractor.\n \n In the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned using the following methods:\n \n? Broadcast message via the Guilford County Central Dispatch\n \n? Police and fire vehicles equipped with public address systems, and\n \n? Door-to-door notification of residents (if time permits).\n \n Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n \n As a result of Harris Teeter?s initial process hazard analyses, several changes were planned at the facility to improve safety and prevent anhydrous ammonia releases.  These changes included improvements to operating procedures, and preventative maintenance program, relocation of emergency shut down equipment to safer locations, increased protection of ammonia equipment (e.g., guarding), increased ammonia safety training, improvements to security and formalizing inspections."
