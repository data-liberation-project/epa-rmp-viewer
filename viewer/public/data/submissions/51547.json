This Risk Management Plan addresses a leased location at 4540 Lincolnway, Clinton, IA 52732.  This leased location consists of 2 ? 12,000 gal anhydrous storage tanks located in a field adjacent to Eastern Iowa Propane at this address.\nThis facility will only store anhydrous ammonia for loading into 1,000 gallon and 1,500 gallon portable tanks for farm use.\n\nAccident Prevention Approach/Release Prevention Steps:\nClinton Feed & Grain is proud of its excellent record in the prevention of accidents relating to the handling of the equipment and substances at its facility.  The company believes that this is the result of having good qualified people, a committed equipment repair and maintenance approach, and management commitment to safety.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the product on site, which we feel is most susceptible to off site releases.  The company spends more effort on equipment maintenance in this area than any other.  In order to mitigate accidents in this area the company has leased this location in a rural area.  This reduces the risk from vehicle accidents to tanks as well as placing the tanks further away from residences.  In addition concrete barriers have been placed around the main tank to prevent damage due to vehicular accident/terrorism. The main storage tank valves are always locked by policy, except when in use to prevent vandals opening the valves and to reduce the risk from pipe failure.  The training and experience of the employees in the handling of this product is a major element of our excellent safety record.  This includes having the Fertilizer manager trained as a local Fire Fighter in the use of Emergency Breathing Apparatus.\n\nRelease Scenarios:\nThe Risk Management Plan submitted evaluates the risk from Anhydrous Ammonia in two separate locations on this site.\nA.\tPermanent Storage Tank ?\na.\tWorst-"

      "SummaryText": "Case\nThis scenario involves the release of the entire permanent storage tank load of ammonia from a transfer hose break.  Although the total amount stored at this location may be 165,000 lbs including the portable tanks, the total release is limited to 130,000 lbs from the permanent tank due to administrative controls in limiting tank fill to 85%.  The worse case is with the wind from the north, which moves the gas into an industrial site located a half mile from the tank.  After the gas passes over this area it then mitigates over fields before reaching any other residence.  Since the valves to the tank are locked when not in use any accident of this magnitude would occur during working hours.  As such, although not taken credit in the analysis, it would be mitigated by personnel intervention to shut isolation valves.\nb.\tAlternate Scenario\nThis scenario involves the same event as in the worse-case above, however, credit is taken for excess check valve operation limiting the total release amount.  In this case, although the gas cloud is smaller it is still postulated to impact the same area as in the worst-case.\n\nB.\tPortable Storage Tanks ?\na.\tWorst-Case\nThis scenario involves the breaking of a pipe/valve on the largest tank.  At the present time this involves a double tank on a single running gear with 8,000 lbs capacity.  The release from the tank would be gone at about 1.7 miles which would involve only 2 businesses and several residences.  This scenario is mitigated by excess flow check valves on the tanks.\nb.\tAlternate Scenerio\nBecause of the reduced total volume for this release area, this event would be effectively the same as the Worst-Case assumptions above.\n\nAccident History:\nClinton Feed & Grain is proud of the fact that we have had no off-site release accidents in the 7 years that the current ownership has been in charge of the facility.  In addition, there have been no anhydrous accidents on-site or off requiring medical attention or equipment unschedul"

Personnel employed by Clinton Feed & Grain and tasked with duties involving anhydrous ammonia are trained on site by observation and training material in the proper handling of anhydrous and accident actions.  Clinton Feed & Grain maintains emergency breathing apparatus on site.  In addition, protective devices including relief valves, hoses and tanks are maintained per state regulation and inspected at least annually by the state of Iowa."
