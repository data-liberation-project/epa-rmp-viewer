      "SummaryText": "The City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities uses chlorine at its Water Treatment Plant.  This chemical is classified as an extremely hazardous substance by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  The same properties that make excellent for disinfecting the water supply, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees, the members of our community and the environment.  Both the Environmental Protection Agency's - Risk Management Plan and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's - Process Safety Management regulations were developed to prevent or minimize the impacts of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances.  The City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities is committed to complying with these regulations, thereby reducing the risk to our employees and the public.\n\nThe Gallatin Water Treatment Plant is located at 1572 Highway 109 South, on the banks of Old Hickory Lake.  Raw water is pumped from an intake at mile 239 of Old Hickory Lake to the treatment plant, where contaminants are removed from the water using the following treatment: 1) water is pre-chlorinated and alum is added to aid in settling; 2) water then proceeds through the flocculation basins and begins the sedimentation process; 3) from the settling basins the water flows into the plant filtration system; 4) water flows through this filtration system on its way to the clearwell; 5) prior to entering the clearwell the water receives post-chlorination for disinfection, aquadene for corrosion control, and flouride to promote strong teeth; 6) the finished water is then pumped from the clearwell into the water supply system.  Chlorine is supplied to the treatment plant in one ton (2,000 pound) cylinders, and there are three to five full cylinders maintained at the treatment plant at all times.  There are two chlorine cylinders in use in the chlorine cylind"

The chlorine feed system operates on a vacuum system, which eliminates the potential for anything other that a minor chlorine leak beyond the chlorine cylinder room.\n\nOn-site and off-site consequence analysis have been conducted to determine the potential impacts of a chlorine release at the Gallatin Water Treatment Plant.  The on-site consequence analysis identifies the impacts to our employees of a minor chlorine release scenario that is limited to the plant property.  The off-site consequence analysis considers two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\".  A \"worst case release scenario\" is defined as one that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint from an accidental release of a regulated toxic substance from a covered process under worst case conditions.  The \"worst case release scenario\" for the Gallatin Water Treatment Plant involves the failure of a one ton cylinder of chlorine, where the entire contents of the cylinder (2,000 pounds) is released as a gas over ten (10) minutes.  The off-site consequence analysis was conducted using RMPComp, an EPA computer-modeling program that uses EPA defined release conditions and user data to determine the toxic endpoint.  RMPComp calculated the toxic endpoint for the \"worst case scenario\" to be 1.3 miles with an estimated affected population of 975 persons.  An \"alternative release scenario\" is defined as one that will reach an endpoint off-site and is more likely to occur than the \"worst case release scenario\".  One \"alternative release scenario\" was analyzed for the Gallatin Water Treatment Plant.  This scenario involved the release of chlorine gas through the 5/16 inch diameter valve body opening on the chlorine cylinder, due to a bad connection or valve failure.  This rele"

The release rate, duration and total release data was then entered into RMPComp which calculated a toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles with an estimated affected population of 17 persons.\n\nThe City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities emphasizes the integration of standard operating procedures, technology and management procedures at all facilities to control the risks associated with the use of chlorine.  The safety features inherent in the design and operation of a water treatment plant combined with the training of our personnel promotes the safe handling of the chlorine used to disinfect the drinking water.  In fact, we have not had an accidental release of chlorine at the water treatment plant in the past five years.  An emergency response plan, which addresses accidental chlorine releases, has been prepared for the Gallatin Water Treatment Plant.  This emergency response plan was developed using guidance from the Chlorine Institute, the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan and the EPA.  The plan is being coordinated with the Gallatin Fire Department and the Sumner County Emergency Management Agency, and includes procedures for public notification, personal protective equipment, first aid and incident investigation.  Also, the City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities has developed a Hazardous Incident Response Team to respond to chemical releases and other emergency situations at its facilities.\n\nThe Gallatin Water Treatment Plant is nearing the end of a major expansion project, part of which involves the addition of new controls and safety equipment.  The City of Gallatin - Department of Public Utilities is committed to the safe operation of our facilities and encourages the input of our employees and our community."
