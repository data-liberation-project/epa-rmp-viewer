      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant (BOP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by continued participation in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), as well as through the resources invested in accident prevention as outlined below.  BOP has been awarded the coveted STAR recognition by OSHA for excellence in occupational safety and health.  \n\nExxonMobil Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, We further believe Exxon[Mobil] to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at BOP.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements have been implemented for the entire plant.  This is the same approach taken with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. \n\nEmployee Participation \nBOP encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention, key thrusts of the OSHA VPP program.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees h"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. \n\nMechanical Integrity \nBOP has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. \n\nSafe Work Practices \nBOP has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  These include control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, energy isolation for equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work permit/procedure,  vehicle entry into process area, confined space entry permit/procedure,  and job safety analyses.  \n\nManagement of Change \nBOP has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, process operating conditions, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  \n\nIncident Investigation \nBOP promptly investigates many types of incidents including those related to fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  \n\nCompliance Audits  \nTo help ensure that the OSHA PSM program is functioning properly and that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations, BOP periodically conducts an audit.  The results of the audit are used to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the program and regu"

Compliance audits are typically conducted at least every 3 years by ExxonMobil personnel from other sites who are considered experts in the safety and environmental fields.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n \nBOP is located in Baytown, Harris County, Texas.  It operates to produce a variety of chemical intermediate feedstocks such as ethylene, propylene, and butadiene.  The plant has regulated flammables such as propylene, ethylene, propane, and butenes.  In addition, the plant uses chlorine and ammonia.  The entire plant is considered one covered process for purposes of this plan.  The number of full-time employees in the RMP report is based on ExxonMobil employees of BOP and excludes company employees that are shared or allocated.  As an element of this resubmission, BOP has updated worst case and alternative scenario information as necessary.  There has been one school closing in the area, Pumphrey Elementary, and the Goose Creek Independent School District School Community Guidance Center located across the street from the Baytown Olefins Plant will close by June 30, 2009.  The worst case scenarios no longer reflect schools within the distances to endpoints.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at BOP have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  Our systems are designed to (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain/control a release and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThere were no accidents identified since 2004 that met the accident history reporting criteria.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nBOP maintains a written emergency response program supplemented with periodic training, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or"

BOP has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nBOP addresses PHA findings and other safety items through many ongoing programs, including those discussed above.  Implementation of a newly-revised work permitting system continues to be a key item in the near term."

      "SummaryText": "ave access to information created as part of the accident prevention program.  \n\nProcess Safety Information \nBOP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \nBOP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that controls are in place to manage these hazards.  New projects that add facilities are analyzed as part of the design process to ensure that the controls necessary to adequately manage the hazards associated with the facilities are installed as part of the project.  Section 7.4.d-g of the RMP report represent the covered process and not a single PHA.\n\nOperating Procedures \nBOP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3), normal and (4) emergency operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and amended as necessary. \n\nTraining\nBOP has implemented a comprehensive training program.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  Operations and mechanical personnel periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained. \n\nContractors \nBOP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any"
