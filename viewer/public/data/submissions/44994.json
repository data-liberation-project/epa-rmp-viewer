The facility is approximately 114,000 sq.ft. in area.  We are also located in a zoned industrial area.  Our process area is divided into two separate areas.  One being the process building housing the tank farm.  This area is fully enclosed by a dike.  The second process area is a separate building, fully contained, with it?s own processing procedures. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: The regulated sudstance handled at this facility is Toluene Diisocyanate ( TDI, unspecified ismer).The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 27,436 pounds.\n        \n                       TOXICS ?

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n-Process Hazard Assessment\n-Process Hazard Review\n-Operating Procedures\n-Training\n-Compliance Audits\n-Incident Investigation\n-Employee Participation\n-Hot Work Permit\n-Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n1.    Inventory Control of TDI\n2.    Two-way communication during off-loading\n3.    Never leaving off-loading area during an operation\n4.    Standard Operating Procedures\n5.    Preventative maintenance of TDI off-loading equipment\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accidental prevention.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\nIredell Fiber keeps records for all significant accidental chemical release that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical release involving materials covered under EPA?s RMP rule during the past five years.\n\n    There has been no accidental release of any chemical at Iredell Fiber.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\nIredell Fiber maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
