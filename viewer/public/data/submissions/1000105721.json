The Management of Change (MOC) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW:\nThe pre-startup safety review (PSSR) applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated. Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a PSSR. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the MOC review. The PSSR is performed in conjunction with the MOC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:\nPeriodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings. In addition to internal compliance audits, the facility is subject to audits by the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) and Cal/OSHA.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:\nAlthough no incidents involving regulated substances have occurred at the Facility in the last five years, an incident investigation program is in place.
