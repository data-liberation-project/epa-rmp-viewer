This Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR 68.155.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Oklahoma City Utilities Department implements a scheduled preventive maintenance program, including inspection and testing, to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide immediate corrective response to any accidents.\n\nThe Lake Overholser WTP staff are trained to respond in the event of a chemical release incident. Emergency response to accidental releases is also coordinated with the Oklahoma City Police and Fire Departments and the State and Local Emergency Response Centers.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Lake Overholser WTP utilizes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (regulated substances) as disinfectants in the drinking water treatment process.\n\nChemical Name\n\nStationary Source\n\nMaximum Inventory\n\nChlorine\n\n20, 1-ton containers (6 containers online in the chlorine room, 1 container at the Filter Building, and 15 containers stored at the chlorine storage area)\n\n44,000 pounds\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\n4,000 gallons (2, 2,000 gallon tanks)\n\n20,600 pounds\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis as well as written process safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identi"

Each incident for a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP.\n\nLake Overholser WTP Management staff are committed to involving employees, or their representatives, in supporting the elements of the RMP/PSMP. The following elements involve employee participation regarding the RMP/PSMP:\n\n?h Involve employees in the PHA, Compliance Audits, and RMP/PSMP reviews and updates\n\n?h Provide employee access to the RMP/PSMP\n\n?h Present an overview of RMP/PSMP requirements to staff annually\n\n?h Involve employees in the development and updating of training\n\n?h Involve employees in an incident investigation\n\nAn authorization and permit program for hot work operations near or around the regulated chlorine and anhydrous ammonia processes has been implemented at the WTP.\n\nContractors performing maintenance or repair on or adjacent to chlorine or anhydrous ammonia processes are instructed in the hazards of the materials on site, and documentation is maintained on contractor understanding of training provided as described in the RMP/PSMP. In addition, emphasis is placed on knowing how to respond in event of emergency.\n\nThe WTP chlorine and anhydrous ammonia system technologies are not confidential and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases within the past 5 years from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe RMP Emergency Response Plan for the WTP i"
