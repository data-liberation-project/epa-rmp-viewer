A vacuum regulator is used to attach a chlorine container to the chlorination system. The same setup is used for the sulfur dioxide container.  A vacuum is created by the site's non-potable water feed system which draws chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas through the chlorine and sulfur dioxide injectors respectively.  This vacuum system provides an excellent mitigation measure that greatly minimizes the risk of a reportable gas release to the environment. If a chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas leak occurs anywhere in the system beyond the vacuum regulator that is attached to the 1-ton container in the Gas Storage Room, then vacuum is lost and the regulator automatically shuts-off gas flow at the container. Also, the vacuum regulator automatically shut-off gas flow at the container, if the non-potable water source is removed from the process.  \r\nThe inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide fluctuates throughout the year. As stated earlier, the Sanitary District's Disinfection Season begins April 01 and ends on October 31. Depending on weather and other factors, disinfection may begin before April 01 and extend beyond October 31. During this time, normal inventory in the Gas Storage Room is six (6) 1-ton chlorine containers and five (5) 1-ton sulfur dioxide containers. During the Disinfection Season, a chlorine container is feeding gas and another container is on standby and connected to a vacuum regulator. When one chlorine container is near empty, the system automatically switches feed to the container on standby, thus provide continuous chlorination.

The WWTP uses an aqueous solution of chlorine (Cl2) to provide disinfection while dechlorination (sulfonation) is accomplished with an aqueous solution of sulfur dioxide (SO2) that reacts with chlorine residuals including mono- and dichloramine before the treated wastewater is discharged through NPDES Outfalls into Trail Creek. Michigan City WWTP provides continuous chlorination and dechlorination for treated water discharged at Outfall #001 from April 01 through October 31. Sand Filter Backwash Water is disinfected year-round and sulfur dioxide (SO2) is added as needed to dechlorinate the backwash water prior to discharge out of Outfall #001. Disinfection and dechlorination of Storm Basin discharge at Outfall #002 occurs from April 01 through October 31 during a significant weather (rain) event. \r\nThe Disinfection Process is located within the perimeter fence line of the wastewater treatment plant site. A physical security protection system including access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the Disinfection Process.  The WWTP maintains chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detection devices within the Disinfection Process including the Gas Storage Room, Effluent Disinfection Room, and the Storm Basin Disinfection Room. There are audible and visual alarms for chlorine and sulfur dioxide to provide warning of a gas release. \r\nThe Effluent Disinfection System and the Storm Basin Disinfection System are systems whereby chlorine a"
