The maximum stored is 289,000 lbs.                                                                                  3]The worst case scenario would be the release of the largest storage tank over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum release would be 26,000 lbs wahich represents the volume of the largest  tank @ 85% capacity, as limited by design.  The distance endpoint of .14 mg/l will be approximately 2.9 miles                The alternative release scenario, a failure of transfer hose for 2 minutes, before the excess flow valve interacts...or the manual shut-off valve would stop the release.  The maximum quantity released would be 11,900 pounds.  The distance to end point @.14mg/l would be l.3 miles, other mitigation measures include riser breakaway.                                                                                                                                             4]This facility is in compliance with the provisions of Safty Requirements for the Storage & Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1, published by the American NationalStandards Institude, Inc.
