      "SummaryText": "Epitek Silicon, LLC is an international manufacturer and supplier of high quality Cz-silicon wafers for the semiconductor industry.  The facility is located at 301 Ridgemont Dr., Allen, Texas 75002.  The SIC code for the operation is 3674; the NAICS code is 334413.  Epitek Silicon currently employees about 42 persons at this facility.  \n\n\n\nThis facility operates Hydrogen Chloride (HCL) and Trichlorosilane (TCS) bulk supply and distribution systems that feed the manufacturing processes used to manufacture epitaxial silicon wafers.  Silicon wafers are produced by depositing a thin single layer of crystal silicon on a silicon disc (wafer) to produce a substrate used in manufacturing semiconductor products, commonly called chips.  HCL and TCS are used in this process.  TCS is the source of silicon for the deposition.  The deposition takes place in an epitaxial reactor operated at elevated temperatures.  The temperature is high enough to separate the silicon and chlorine atoms contained in the Trichlorosilane.  Hydrogen chloride is used to remove silicon deposits on equipment piece parts during the reaction.  Hydrogen chloride is also a major by-product of the deposition process.  HCL emissions are controlled in accordance with applicable state and federal air regulations.  The facility has obtained a permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for the emissions from the process.\n\n\n\nHydrogen Chloride (HCL) is a highly corrosive gas that will quickly combine with water vapor in the air to form Hydrochloric Acid.  The acid will quickly react and form less harmful chloride salts and water in the environment.  The above reactions occur quickly in the environment thus the reactive effects of a release will end shortly (within minutes to a few hours) of the time when the release stops.  The system consists of bulk storage and distribution piping and equipment.  The maximum inventory of HCL on site exceeds the reporting threshold for RMP.  \n\n\n\nHCL gas is withdrawn"

      "SummaryText": " from the storage tanks through a series of regulators and automatic valves equipped with monitors, alarms, and automatic shutdowns that vent to gas scrubbers should there be any leaks.  Additionally, HCL gas is only withdrawn from the storage tanks as it is used.  This minimizes the amount of gas that would be released from using the system.  The pressure of the gas in the distribution system is kept relatively low to reduce the potential for leaks in the distribution system.  The distribution system is constructed using corrosion resistant Hastelloy steel, with welded connections where possible, valve enclosures vented through scrubbers, purge systems vented through scrubbers, alarms with automatic shutdowns, manual shutdowns, and employee training.  \n\n\n\nTrichlorosilane (TCS) is a colorless volatile liquid that is corrosive and extremely flammable.  TCS reacts with water to form corrosive compounds and may ignite on contact with water or air.\n\n\n\nThe TCS system consists of bulk liquid supply and distribution piping and equipment.  Liquid transfer is accomplished by pressurizing the bulk storage container vapor space with inert gas (argon).  The increased pressure forces the TCS into the distribution piping via a dip tube installed in the vessel.  When the active container is depleted, the system automatically switches to an alternate supply, typically a 55-gallon secondary supply source located in the distribution system cabinet, and warns the operator that the empty bulk container needs to be exchanged.  \n\n \n\nTCS is received at the facility in a cargo transport vessel.  It remains in the transport vessel at the facility.  No bulk liquid transfer is conducted at the facility.  Empty cargo containers are exchanged, as needed.  During container change out, the system piping and electrical controls function to first clear the lines of residual TCS to allow the empty cargo vessel to be safely disconnected, and second to check system integrity and cleanliness once a new"

At the use points, the TCS is contacted with a carrier gas, typically Hydrogen, to provide vapor phase feed to a reaction chamber. Maximum intended inventory at the facility exceeds the reporting threshold for RMP.\n\n\n\nThe facility has evaluated and reported one worst case scenario and has evaluated alternate scenarios and reported one which will result in an offsite impact that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nEpitek Silicon and the product supplier have developed and implemented Process Safety Management Programs in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 for Hydrogen Chloride and Trichlorosilane in order to eliminate or minimize releases from the facility.  This serves as the prevention plan required by RMP.  The facility has also developed and implemented procedures for safe work practices including control of hazardous energy.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\n\n\nThe supplier of both distribution systems has incorporated safety provisions that include numerous alarms, automatic shutdowns, and employee procedures designed to insure that the HCL and TCS is safely stored and used in the process.

In addition, restrictive flow orifices and excess flow detection, low-low and high-high detection systems are in place with shutdown capabilities.  The TCS bulk delivery area is further protected with an AFFF foam suppression system, 14 ft. high fire walls, and 110% secondary containment.  Any loss of exhaust detected at any gas cabinet or reactor will result in shutdown of the source gas.  Ballards are in place at both bulk delivery areas to prevent damage due to vehicular traffic.\n\n\n\nThe company has taken every reasonable precaution to insure that any release is small.  The bulk storage vessels for HCL and TCS are protected DOT approved shipping containers.  They represent a very low risk of releasing a regulated substance.  \n\n\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APCI) is the supplier of the HCL and TCS products, bulk storage and distribution systems.  A written agreement exists between Epitek Silicon and APCI stating ownership of equipment as well as ownership of the regulated chemicals.  With this type of agreement both Epitek Silicon and APCI employees are involved in all chemical supply change outs and associated work.
