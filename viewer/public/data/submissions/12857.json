Facility policy\n\n     The owners and employees of Calumet Y Farm Store are committed to preventing any accidental toxic release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release occurs, the facility is prepared to work with the Calumet Volunteer Fire Department and the El Reno Fire Department, the Canadian Co. LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate and release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility information\n\n     The primary activity is the sale of fabrication steel products and Army surplus items.  The secondary activity is receiving, storing and loading nurse tanks of anhydrous ammonia for use in agriculture.\n\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 106,000 pounds in our two 12,000 gallon storage tanks.  All deliveries are made by truck.\n\n3.  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of one storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds, which represents the volume of one storage tank (plumbed seperately from the other with seperate load-out stations,) at 85 percent of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to end point (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.63 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternative release scenario would be the release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to endpoint would be .47 miles\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\n     The facility has implemented provisions of the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture for the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia which include provisions of ANSI K-61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111\n\n5.  The five year accident history\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n     a.  have caused any deaths, injuries, or s"

The emergency response program\n\n     The facility has:\n\n     a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38:\n\n     b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\n     c.  a written emergency response program, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed using the California Hazard Addeddment checklist to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia afety recommendations for implementation at this time."
