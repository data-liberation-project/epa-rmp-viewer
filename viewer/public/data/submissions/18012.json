Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Agriservices of Brunswick, LLC @\nBrunswick, Missouri (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental\nreleases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the\nfacility is prepared to work the the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate\nand minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to \nfarmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for blending into \nmixed-grade fertilizer for crop production nutrients.  Propane is stored for grain drying.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in two (2) tanks of 12,000 and 18,000 gallons capacity.\nThe maximum amount in storage is 127,500 pounds.  Propane is stored in one (1) tank\nof 12,000 gallons capacity.  The maximum in storage is 37,740 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest tank\n     as follows:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia - The maximum quantity released would be 76,500 pounds,\nwhich represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited\nby design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts\nper million, or ppm) is 1.8 miles.\n\nPropane - The maximum quantity released would be 37,740 pounds.  The distance to\nthe endpoint (point of 1.0 pounds per square inch, or psi) as an explosive cloud is 0.3\nmiles or 1,585 feet.\n\nb.  The alternate case scenarios, based on either the five-year accident history or the most\n     likely potential incident are as follows:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia - The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a\n3-inch transfer hose "

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm)\nis 1.2 miles.\n\nPropane - The alternate release scenario is a release from a hose rupture caused by a\npull-away and assumes a 25 foot length of 4-inch transfer hose.  The active mitigation\ndevices are assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the\nhose.  The maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint\n(point of 1.0 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles or 175 feet.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\n\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The 1992 Edition of the National Fire\nProtection Association (NFPA) Standard 58 was also used.  Both standards are referenced\nin the Registration Form Section 8.3.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane\nin the past five years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage\nat the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries,\nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or enviornmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.  a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.  provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community\n     right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard\n     29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed"
