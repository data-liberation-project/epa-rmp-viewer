All ammonia piping is identified by \"YELLOW\" exterior color and is properly\n                            labeled to indicate relative pressure, state of the refrigerant, and application.\n                         2.

Employees are trained not to climb or walk on the piping.\n                         4. Any piping which may be exposed to mechanical damage is protected by guards\n                             visual signs, and employee awareness.\n                         5.

Only approved  maintenance procedures and materials are used.\n                         8. All pressure relief valves are inspected annually and replaced every 5 years.\n\n\n   Our facility has 24hour-7day a week security coverage. Together with the maintenance department\nthis provides our front line of detection and emergency response to an ammonia emergency. Security\nwill be notified in the event of an ammonia emergency by  anyone detecting the presence of ammonia\ni"
