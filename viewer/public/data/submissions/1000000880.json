ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston is committed to providing its employees and the surrounding community with a safe and healthy environment.  The Risk Management Program is an integral part of our strong commitment to \u00c2\u00bfsustainable development,\u00c2\u00bf which means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  Sustainable Development requires reductions in the generation of wastes and pollutants, protection of clean air and clean water, sustainable protection of the land, and the wise use of energy.  It requires employee commitment, strategic thinking, innovation, the involvement of our suppliers, new technology and enhanced production processes.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Park Rapids, Minnesota processing facility (Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen) produces various potato products such as french fries, hashbrowns and formed potato products.  The plant site consists of a main processing plant, raw potato storage buildings, boiler facility, primary, secondary and tertiary water treatment facility, and refrigerated cold storage.  Activities are conducted at this site during all months of the year.\n\nThe adjoining refrigerated cold storage warehouse owned by AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. was purchased by Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen in 2009.  The EPA Facility Identifier for the AmeriCold RMP was deregistered and the process (#2\u00c2\u00bfCold Storage) was included in the Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen RMP submittal.\n\nThe potato processing cycle includes a wide array of steps.  The plant purchases the majority of its potatoes from local growers.  Since potatoes have a single growing season, they must be held under controlled storage conditions.  Prior to processing, the potatoes are separ"

The final products are frozen, packaged and prepared for shipping.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nLamb Weston/RDO Frozen\u00c2\u00bfs accident prevention/loss control systems and policies involve a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and best-management practices.  The OSHA-PSM and the EPA-RMP plans work together to assure that potential on-site hazards and off-site consequences are identified and controlled to the best of our ability, and that the processes are meeting health and safety objectives.\n\nThe RMP Prevention Program is comprised of the 13 elements of OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs PSM program: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Operating Procedures, Hot Work Permits, Employee Training, Incident Investigation, Mechanical Integrity, Emergency Planning & Response, Contractor Safety, and Audits.  \n\nEmployee participation brought together people that knew and understood the system, from practical experience as well as their technical knowledge, to develop the Plan.  Process safety information is a collection of data that allows us to identify and understand the hazards posed by our inventory.  Representatives from our skilled work force and Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen management, who understood the process being analyzed including the engineering behind the covered process, conducted the process hazard analysis.  This analysis identifies potential process failures that could result in an uncontrolled release of ammonia.   \n\nIn order to safely manage changes that need to be made to the processes containing ammonia, a system of checks and balances has been established.  This system will evaluate safety prior to the work being done, and provide a solid review of the system to assure that once started, it will run as designed.  Standard operating proc"

In addition, a policy and procedure are used to assure that proper safety precautions are taken for all personnel performing Hot Work.  The integrity of the refrigeration system equipment is maintained according to recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices and according to a well-documented preventive maintenance program.\n\nAn extensive training program is in place for those employees and contractors involved in working on or around the process and covers operating procedures, health and safety hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  The facility also has a training program for all employees and contractors regarding the hazards of the chemical and safe work practices to be used.  Part of this training includes monthly safety meetings as well as drills on spill response and plant evacuation.  \n\nAny incidents related to the ammonia refrigeration systems are promptly investigated even though the rule only requires investigation of those incidents, which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release.  All incidents are analyzed, resolved, and findings shared with affected employees.  In order to assure compliance with all elements of the prevention program, an audit is conducted every three years including a report of the findings and documentation of any deficiencies corrected.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen Minnesota Facility in the last five years from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  \n\nThe Park Rapids, Minnesota facility has an emergency action plan which has been coordinated (reviewed) with Park Rapids Fire Departm"

The purpose of the plan is to establish policies and procedures for protecting the health and safety of employees, contractors, and visitors, and to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations.  \n\nTraining of employees and contractors includes providing a copy of the plan upon initial employment at Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen and reviewing it for their specific assignment, annual refresher training for current employees, and review for all whenever the plan is changed.  In addition, plant evacuation drills are conducted on a regular basis. \n\nThe plan is comprehensive enough to deal with all types of emergencies specific to the Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen, Park Rapids, Minnesota facility and defines the following:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tHow to conduct activities in a manner that protects the safety of employees, the public, and the environment\n\t\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPreferred means for reporting fires, hazardous materials incidents, medical, and any other emergencies\n\t\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEmergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments\n\t\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcedures to account for all employees including contractors and visitors\n\t\n\u00c2\u00bf\tNames of agencies and persons to contact for further assistance, information, or explanation of the plan\n\nThe Park Rapids, Minnesota facility has established an emergency response system based on the Incident Command System (ICS) concept developed by the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS).  This system is utilized by local, state, and national response agencies and provides for integration of external agency support during emergency incidents.  Regardless of the severity of the event, the ICS will be implemented.\n\nThree main hazardous situations may be encountered at Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen, Park Rapids, Minnesota facility:  fir"

A fire situation beyond the ability of plant personnel to manage with the use of hand-held fire extinguishers or by the automatic fire suppression system within the plant will prompt activation of the Park Rapids Fire Department for assistance.  There are three integrated hazardous materials response teams (HMRT) on site for responding to any controlled chemical release.  The magnitude of the release will determine the extent of the HMRT involvement which may be activated along with local, regional, state, and national response agencies as needed.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Park Rapids, Minnesota facility takes seriously its responsibility for the safety of its employees, neighbors, and community.  Central to this responsibility are our programs to prevent the release of chemicals to the environment.  We will continue to implement these precautions and programs, to act as a responsible neighbor, and to maintain the goodwill of the community."
