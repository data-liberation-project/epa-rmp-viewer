Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activities at the South Charleston facility are the production of Polyols which are used in the manufacture of polyurethanes.  The Polyols that are manufactured are either Flexible Polyols or Polymer Polyols.  The RMP chemicals used in the manufacture of Flex Polyols are propylene oxide and ethylene oxide. The RMP chemicals used in manufacture of Polymer Polyols are acrylonitrile and vinylidene chloride (RMP flammable chemical).  In summary the Bayer South Charleston facility has three (3) RMP listed toxic chemicals and one flammable chemical. All three RMP toxic chemicals were modeled using worst case release parameters as a screening exercise to determine the distance to toxic endpoint.   Acryl"

The flammable chemical (vinylidene chloride) was also modeled using worst case release parameters to determine distance to 1 pound per square inch overpressure.\n\n\nc.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe South Charleston Plant complies with all elements of the OSHA PSM Rule and the EPA RMP Rule.  There are safety procedures, standard operation emergency procedures, accident investigations, hot work and line opening permits, extensive training programs, on-site emergency response teams, vessel inspection programs, and experienced personnel both in the salaried and hourly workforce.  \n\nd.   Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases in the past five years with off-site consequences.  Since the initial implementation of the RMP rule there have been no offsite impacts from release of RMP chemicals from the South Charleston manufacturing facility. \n\ne.  Facility Emergency Response Program\n\nThe South Charleston Emergency Response System consists of volunteer emergency response teams from Bayer and the host company that work rotating shifts and straight days.  The goal is to have 3 A? 6 emergency squad members always available on shift and this group is supplemented by straight day people, call outs and the South Charleston Fire Department.  The Bayer and host site emergency squad people receive approximately 16 to 24 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  In the case of a significant fire the South Charleston Fire department would likely be involved.
