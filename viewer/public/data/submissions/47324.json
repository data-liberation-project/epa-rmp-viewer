Our program integrates ongoing upgrades in periodic maintenance scheduling, ISO documentation, and Process Safety Management.\n\nCRC personnel receive initial training in emergency response plans and policy during new employee orientation, and hands on training annually. Contracts are in place with local response companies to insure immediate service should contingencies occur that exceeds the capabilities of CRC equipment and personnel.\n\nCRC processes covered by the Risk Management program include our formaldehyde manufacturing plant and associated storage tanks and load racks. The regulated substance (per 68.130) is formaldehyde solution (CAS 50-00-0). As the attached Risk Management Plan details, our worse case scenario involved the complete failure of one of the storage tanks.  While the chances of this occurring are extremely unlikely, analysis of this scenario was required under the RMP rule. Any leak or failure in the formaldehyde storage system would be contained by the dike system around the tanks.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention is integrated with all aspects of CRC operations. Process safety information contained in each Formaldehyde Operators Manual and MSDS data. Training provides intensive hands-on knowledge of the production process. CRC documents training on each of the required areas. Written operating procedures are documented and controlled through CRC ISO 9001 program. Operating Procedures are reviewed and a written test is administered in the formal training sessions.\n\nEach employee involved in operating Formaldehyde Plant, Tanks, or Load rack is trained in an overview of the process and familiarization with the operating procedures described previously. The training emphasizes safe operation of the plant and associated systems.  Several weeks of on the job training emphasizes job tasks, safety and health hazards, normal and emergency oper"
