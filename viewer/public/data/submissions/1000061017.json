MillerCoors is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. MillerCoors staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.\n\n\n\nMillerCoors LLC facility has a long standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. MillerCoors policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nMillerCoors LLC facility is located at 15801 E First Street, Irwindale, California. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system.  The regulated substance in use is: anhydrous ammonia for the Ammonia Refrigeration System.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; MillerCoors LLC Irwindale, California facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  Furthermore, the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associat"
