This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being submitted as the five year RMP update.  This RMP includes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\u00c2\u00b7\tIntroduction;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tRupari policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tHazard Assessment;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tPrevention Program;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tFive-Year Accident History;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tEmergency Response Plan; \n\u00c2\u00b7\tEmergency Communications;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\n\u00c2\u00b7\tManagement Program\n\nII.\tRupari Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Rupari; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.

Rupari is an importer, manufacturer and distributor of quality pork. Specializing in ribs, both domestic and imported, the company sells to both retail and foodservice customers around the country. \n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311612.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for processing and distribution.   \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating coolers, freezers, and production areas at the facility. \n\nThe amount of ammonia in System 1 is approximately 23,000 pounds.  System 1 is used for cooling in the storage freezer, coolers, process areas, and compressor oil cooling.  System 1 consists of four (4) high stage compressors, two (2) booster compressors, two (2) evaporative condensers, three (3) storage freezer unit evaporators, eight (8) cutting room evaporators, four (4) holding cooler evaporators, one (1) injection room evaporator, two (2) shipping dock evaporators, one (1) palletizing room evaporator, two (2) receiving dock evaporators, two (2) RTE chill cell evaporators, one (1) RTE package room evaporator, one (1) RTE cooler evaporator, one (1) RTE cooler evaporator before the smokehouse, two (2) tumbling room evaporators, one (1) auto purger, one (1) low temperature accumulator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) high temperature accumulator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) high pressure receiver, and one (1) intercooler.\n\nThe amount of ammonia in System 2 has been calculated at approximately 9,700 pounds.
