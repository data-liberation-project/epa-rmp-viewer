In service to the\r\ncommunity, the County has a history of adhering to proactive approaches for the prevention and\r\nemergency response of accidental releases of toxic substances.  Current prevention and\r\nemergency response polices adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Prevention\r\nProgram and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68 regulations.\r\n\r\n     The Facilities are located \r\nin Jensen Beach, Florida\r\n and utilize chlorine gas in the water\r\nand wastewater treatment \r\nprocess. A single RMP is being submitted for the Facilities due to the\r\nfact that the Facilities are located on a contiguous piece of property, owned by the County. Each\r\nPlant maintains a non-enclosed chlorination\r\n area and chlorination distribution system on-site to\r\nfeed both \r\nplants.\r\n  Chlorine is delivered to \r\neach central\r\n \r\nopen area\r\n and stored on-site in cylinders\r\ncontaining 2,000 pounds of liquefied chlorine under pressure when full. The chlorine \r\nfacility at\r\nthe WTP\r\n holds a maximum of ten (10) 2,000 pound \r\ncylinders. The WWTP chlorine facility\r\nholds a maximum of four (4) 2,000 pound cylinders.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The \r\nFacilities\r\n have an outstanding performance history in conjunction with handling,\r\nstoring, maintaining and operating of chlorine gas.

The chlorination system is\r\ndesigned utilizing latest technologies and industry specific design codes and standards.  The\r\ncurrent emergency response plans are documented and coordinated with the community\r\nemergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). \r\nOperational staff are trained according to these response plans.\r\n\r\n     The EPA 40 CFR 68 requires offsite consequence analysis of two (2) release scenarios\r\nfor toxic substances identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release.\"  The \"worst case\r\nrelease\" is defined by EPA as \"the owner/operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in\r\nthe largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  For the worst case release, EPA\r\nspecifies the parameters to use in calculating the distance the chlorine will travel to achieve its \r\n\"toxic endpoint.\"  The alternative release is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case\r\nrelease scenario\", such as a pipe leak. \r\n\r\n     Utilizing the EPA's RMP* COMP Model, a  distance \r\nof\r\n \r\n4.3\r\n miles \r\nwas calculated for\r\n the\r\nworst case release \r\ntoxic endpoint and\r\n 0.30 \r\nmiles\r\n for the alternative release.

It is noted that if an actual release did occur according to the alternative\r\nrelease scenario, the population at risk would be substantially less due to the plume of gas being\r\nmore in the form of an elliptical pattern moving down wind of the point source rather than a\r\ncircle centered on the point source.\r\n\r\n     The use of chlorination within water treatment and wastewater treatment has yielded\r\nenormous benefits in th"
