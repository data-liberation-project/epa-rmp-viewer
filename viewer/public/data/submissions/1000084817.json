The company completed a name change that took affect in April 2019. Also the facility has changed is address. While it is located at the same coordinates, the main entrance into the facility has moved to 6001 Dakota Ave., South Sioux City, Nebraska 68776. The SIC code for the operation is 2013; the NAICS code is 311612.  The facility has approximately 566 full time employees.  The facility typically operates three shifts per day, six days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\r\n\r\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68 as their accidental release prevention program.  The system is continuously monitored by computer based controls that alert technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM/RMP program.  The system is visually inspected periodically for proper daily operation.  System parameters are digitally logged in the PLC system. Safe operation of the system will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures and providing appropriate training to employees.\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed and implemented a written Emergency Action Plan as defined in 29 CFR 1910.38 as their emergency response program.  Emergency evacuation drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel quickly and safely evacuate the plant. This facility will utilize outside agencies and/or organizations to perform emergency response measures in the event of a fire, explosi"

Ammonia is used in two processes within the facility, the Ammonia Refrigeration System and as a product processing aid with the Process Ammonia System.\r\n\r\nThe Refrigeration Systems are closed loop two stage refrigeration systems. The facility utilizes the refrigeration systems to keep products at temperature and preserve food safety standards.  The major components of the ammonia Refrigeration system are located in the mechanical rooms.  \r\n\r\nThe Process Ammonia System converts food grade anhydrous ammonia to ammonium hydroxide, and is used as a processing aid in the production of beef products at the facility.  This process is an approved antimicrobial treatment by the USDA food safety inspection service. The ammonia used for this purpose is stored separately on site from the refrigeration system but the two processes are in very close proximity to each other and tied together via a common pump out system.\r\n\r\nSupport operations include a maintenance shop, welding shop, parts warehouse area, and administrative offices.\r\n  \r\nAnhydrous ammonia is listed as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The operating capacity of each system exceeds this threshold.\r\n\r\nIII. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.

All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/RMP management of change provisions stated in the facility's plan.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system is controlled and monitored 24/7 by an Operations Center from a remote location.  The system is equipped with a series of redundant fail safe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can not be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with ammonia detectors that alarm and start local exhaust ventilation system when the presence of ammonia is sensed above set point levels in the engine room.  The system can be manually shutdown using a kill switch located outside the mechanical room exits.\r\n\r\nIV. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThis facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years that are reportable under the RMP regulations.   \r\n\r\nV. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving anhydrous ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic site visits with local responders and conducts evacuation drills with employees and contractors on site.\r\n\r\nEmpirical foods has notified the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility's emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  \r\n\r\nVI.
