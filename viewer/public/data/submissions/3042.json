              "Description": "The ammonia railcar process is considered separate only for the purposes of the EPA RMP regulation.  It is not covered under OSHA PSM regulations.  This process consists of up to three ammonia railcars on a single siding, decoupled from the switch engine, and awaiting spotting and hookup for unloading.  A total of five DuPont owned railcars are dedicated to this service with a maximum of three full cars allowed within the Pontchartrain stationary source at anytime. Some prevention programs are shared with other processes on the stationary source.  No modification to the railcars is preformed on the stationary source and, therefore, some aspects of the prevention program do not apply to this pseudo process.   Note: Single compliance audit conducted for all three processes.  Completion of audit changes is shown as process specific since it was not completed at the same time for all processes.",

At the Pontchartrain Plant, the policies are implemented through the Pontchartrain Plant Process Management Manual (PMM).  This manual is available to all employees through hard copies. In addition, the Pontchartrain Plant Emergency Manual lays out the complete Emergency Response program for the site.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe DuPont Pontchartrain Plant consists of 1132 acres, located in St John the Baptist Parish between the unincorporated areas of LaPlace and Reserve.  About 200 acres of the property are used for manufacturing areas, 590 acres are leased for cattle grazing, 30 acres are leased for recreation, and the remainder is set aside for wildlife habitat and future manufacturing needs.  A portion of the area used for manufacturing is leased to DuPont Dow Elastomers, LLC.  The DuPont Dow Elastomers facilities are considered to be a separate \"stationary source\" for the purposes of 40 CFR part 68.\n\nThe DuPont Pontchartrain Plant site consists of 2 manufacturing processes:  \n\n*  Paraphenylene Diamine\n*  Isophorone Diamine\n\nIn the production of these products, anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance and is used as raw material.\n\nOn site storage of ammonia railcars is also treated as a separate process for the purposes of 40 CFR part 68.\n\nWORST-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic chemical is failure of an ammonia storage tank, with no mitigation assumed.  This release has an off-site impact, as determined by the use of t"

This release is unlikely due to the high-integrity design of the tank and associated equipment.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThere are no regulated flammables present above the threshold quantities.\n\nALTERNATIVE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nA pipe leak in the Anhydrous Ammonia unloading transfer piping was assumed, with a 10 minute\nduration because of the requirement for monitoring during unloading operations.  This release was assumed to be mitigated by the proper function of excess flow valves installed on the railcar being unloaded and on the ammonia tank receiving the material.  The excess flow valves limit the amount of ammonia released to the contents of the unloading lines.  This release has an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance and the \"Landview\" program census data.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThere are no regulated flammables present above the threshold quantities.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC \nPREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DuPont Pontchartrain Plant processes follow the requirements of DuPont Corporate SHE \nStandard S21A, \"Process Safety Management.\"  This Standard includes and embraces the requirements \nof 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nOur Safety Programs include:\n\nDesigning for Safety ...\n- A documented process technology system covers hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and \n  process design basis.\n- Extensive accident prevention and mitigation systems are strategically located.\n- Applicable codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n- Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity.\n- Quality Assurance ensures fabrication in accordance with design specifications and proper assembly.\n\nMaintaining our Plant ...\n- Maintenance personnel are trained and experienced.\n- Contractors are trained and qualified.\n- A work permit system controls hazards.\n\nOperating Safe"
