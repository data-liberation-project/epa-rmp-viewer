The RMP covered process at the PRT facility is the planned railcar storage of liquefied butane.  For the butane railcar storage process, the regulated substance is butane, which will be stored as a liquid under pressure.  Thee will be a total of 50-70 railcars at any time in the facility.  All railcars at the facility will be Department of Transportation (DOT) approved for the storage of butane.  the railcars will be inspected at client's facilities prior to shipment to PRT, will be checked for content and quantity  at the PRT facility on arrival, and will be visually inspected regularly while in storage at the facility.  Railcars with various capacities may be at the PRT site but the maximum quantity in a single railcar will not exceed 163,600 pounds (lbs.).\n\n\n\nThe railcars will be on a track on the southeast side of the facility.  A worst-case scenario (WCS) hazard assessment using EPA's RMP*COMP computer model showed that there will be no residences or population within the WCS hazard impact distance of 0.4 miles (700 m).  Thus, the location chosen for the butane railcar is deemed appropriate for public safety.\n\n\n\nThe facility will have an active accident prevention program in place with periodic inspections, leak detection with handheld explosion proof instruments, restrictions on vehicles near the railcars, and use of explosion proof instruments in the vicinity of the rail cars.  The facility is developing a prevention program including process safety information, process hazard analysis, safe operating procedures, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, hot work permit, and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nThe facility will coordinate with Carbon County local emergency planning commission (LEPC) for emergency response in case of a leak and fire/explosion.  The contact information of the LEPC is available at the site.\n\n\n\nThis is a new pr"
