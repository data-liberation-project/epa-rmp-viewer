It is assumed that the entire contents of the sphere are released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the release quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nUsing the equations for calculating over pressure from the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCAG).  \n7 The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure equals 0.76 miles. \n\nUsing Fire Radiation Table 22, page 70 of OCAG.\n7 The distance for radiant heat dose of 5 kW/square meter is 0.85 miles.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAn overpressurization of a tank rupture disk or relief valve results in a release of 12,000 pounds of vinyl chloride.  The entire contents of the tank are released over 2 minutes.  Unconfined vapor travels to the lower flamma"
