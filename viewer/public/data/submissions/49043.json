      "SummaryText": "A. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nNestle's most important asset is its people.  Our employees are the source of our competitive advantage and the key to a successful and productive organization.  We recognize the importance of a safe work environment and make every reasonable effort to provide employees with a safe and healthy workplace.  We also expect each employee to work safely.\n\nThe Nestle USA Safety Manual has been developed by a cross-company team of employees to provide a guide to safe behavior.   By committing to these guidelines we all contribute to our vision to be the premier diversified food company in the U.S.\n\nAmmonia safety is a key item in the plant safety program.  Nestle takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Factory Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNestle's Danville Plant produces food products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the food products and the production areas.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Danville Plant.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any ammonia-related incidents at the Danville Plant during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Danville Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  \n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\no Notification Procedures\no Evacuation Plan\no Emergency Shutdown Procedures\no Specific Action Plans for Emergencies (Including Ammonia Leak Procedures)\no Emergency Medical Procedures\n\nThe program has been coordinated with the Danville Fire Department.\n\n\nF.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral modifications have been made to the ammonia refrigeration system over the past five years to improve safety.  Since all measures identified have already been implemented to date there are no current planned changes to further improve safety at the facility."
