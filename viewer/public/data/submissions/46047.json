This commitment is inherent in its comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Ottawa County LEPC and Allendale Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cheese Manufacturing.  The plant is located at 4700 Rich Street in Allendale, Michigan.  We have one RMP-regulated substance, Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese.  The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is approximately 63,480 lbs.\n\n3  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth by the EPA under 40 CFR part 68.  The ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard"

      "SummaryText": " Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a What If/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of (five years or when changes dictate).  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently if needed.  All training will be documented and validated by employees on the LFC Training Tracking System.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagemen"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted regularly at Leprino Foods Company.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nLeprino Foods Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nLeprino Foods Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nLeprino Foods Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construct"
