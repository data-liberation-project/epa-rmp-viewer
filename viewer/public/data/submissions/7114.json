The Cadet Plant manufactures several of the specialty chemicals mentioned above.  The manufacturing of these products requires the use of several raw material chemicals regulated by the EPA as regulated substances.  The regulated substances handled at the Cadet Plant include the following:\n \nX Bromine\nX Carbon Disulfide \nX Dimethylamine \nX Epichlorohydrin \nX Formaldehyde\nX Monomethylamine \nX Phosphorous Trichloride \n \n Manufacturing of the specialty chemicals occurs in the production area of the Cadet Plant, which contains 13 process vessels.  The process vessels are used to react and formulate the various specialty chemical products.  In addition to the process vessels, the manufacturing processes are supported by approximately 70 storage tanks, rail car loading and unloading stations, tanker truck loading and unloading stations, and various utility systems.\n \n Most of the production processes are monitored and controlled by a Distributive Control System (DCS), an automated computer control system.  The DCS allows for the continuous monitoring of thousands of process parameters, and allows for the quick identification of any parameters that may have deviated from their intended range.  The DCS is programmed to automatically correct or alarm these parameter deviations, allowing for the safe operation of the various production processes.  In addition to the DCS, highly trained Chemical Operators perform the day-to-day tasks required to safely operate the various processes.\n \n  \n Worst-Case Release & Alternative Release Scenarios (68.155(c)):\n \n \n Worst-Case Flammables:\n \n The worst-case scenario for the regulated flammable substances handled at the Cadet Plant is as follows:\n \n The failure scenario involves a railcar c"

The presence of the passive mitigation containment system reduces the release rate to the environment to approximately 10% of the unmitigated release rate.  \n \n The resulting pool is assumed to evaporate at the 3-year maximum daily temperature of 100F.  Using approved methodology, the endpoint, as defined by EPA, is approximately 0.78 miles from the release.  Please note, however, that carbon disulfide is extremely flammable and would probably be ignited within the Cadet Plant.  An explosion of this regulated substance would cause a 1 pound per square inch (psi) over pressure (the EPA defined endpoint) up to a distance of 1,000 feet from the location of the release. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the carbon disulfide vapors would impact public receptors at levels above the established endpoint.  \n \n \n Alternative - Flammables:\n \n As required by the EPA, Buckman Laboratories assessed the consequences of a \"more-likely\" release scenario or alternative release scenario.

The alternative release scenario for each of the regulated toxic substances handled at the Cadet Plant is as follows:\n \n Bromine:\n \n The failure scenario for bromine involves the failure of a flange connection in the bromine transfer line either to the tank or to the plant, during charging.  This release forms a pool in a passive mitigation diked area.  Upon detection of the leak, the transfer of bromine through the transfer line is ceased and emergency procedures are implemented.  Based on approved methodology, the endpoint for this scenario, as defined by EPA, was approximately 0.6 miles from the release. \n \n Phosphorous Trichloride:\n \n The failure scenario for phosphorous trichloride involves the failure of a flex line during the unloading of a tanker truck.

Based on approved methodology, the endpoint for this scenario, as defined by EPA, was approximately 0.4 miles from the release. \n \n Formaldehyde - 37% Solution:\n \n Please note that the worst-case release scenario for formaldehyde does not impact off-site receptors.  Therefore, it was determined that alternative release scenarios would not impact off-site receptors, either.  The reason for this is that a spill/release of formaldehyde forms an evaporating pool in a passive mitigated diked area.  Due to the low vapor pressure of a 37% formaldehyde solution, the evaporation rate of the material is low.  Thus, a large pool would be formed and the limiting factor is the maximum size of the pool.  The largest possible pool that can be formed is in the passive mitigated diked area where the formaldehyde solution is stored.\n \n Based on approved methodology, the endpoint for this scenario, as defined by EPA, was approximately 0.2 miles from the release. \n \n Epichlorohydrin:\n \n Please note that the worst-case release scenario for epichlorohydrin does not impact off-site receptors.  Therefore, it was determined that alternative release scenarios would not impact off-site receptors, either.

In addition to this rule, the Cadet Plant complies with various Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, which address accidental release prevention.  Specifically, Buckman Laboratories has established a Process Safety Management System for each of the regulated substances mentioned above.  The Process Safety Management System complies with 29 CFR 1910.119 and the requirements of 40 CFR 68.\n \n In addition to the regulatory requirements, Buckman Laboratories has also installed an emergency release containment system to reduce the consequences of an accidental release.  The Process Vessels are equipped with systems to relieve pressures that may build up beyond design limits.  The relief systems consist of piping, which leads from each Process Vessel's pressure relief valve to a knock-out tank and quench tank.  These tanks allow for the containment of any released pressure and chemical vapor, thus, minimizing the potential release of regulated substances to the ambient air. \n \n The process areas and tank farm areas also have passive mitigation systems, such as liquid release containment systems.  These systems consist of diked areas, which would contain any spilled material and limit the effects on the environment.  The design of these diked areas reduces the total surface area of the spill, thus, reducing the evaporation rate of the spilled material.  In most cases, these diked areas may reduce the evaporation rate by a factor of 10, which reduces the distance to the endpoints associated with an accidental release.\n \n Chemical specific prevention steps have also been enacted and include the following:\n \n Bromine:\n \n7 Storage tank enclosed and located in a diked area to reduce emissions to air in the event of a storage tank failure;\n7 Storage tank not vented to atmosphere; sealed vessel;\n7 Individua"
