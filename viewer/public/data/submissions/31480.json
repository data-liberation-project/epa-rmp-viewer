      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of Central Arkansas Water (CAW) to operate the Jack H. Wilson Water Treatement Plant (Wilson WTP) safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the chlorine system and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  Safe operation depends on proper storage of chlorine, proper handling of the chlorination system, and inherent safety features in the design of the chlorination system.  Safety in storage and handling is achieved through the use of safe handling procedures and training of personnel.\nThe policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Wilson WTP.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the Little Rock Fire Department. \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\nPrimary Activities:  The primary activity is municipal water treatment.  The Wilson WTP originally was constructed in 1963 and has a current capacity of 100 million gallons per day (mgd).  The sludge from the facility is pumped to the Fourche Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) as a solution.\n\nUse of Regulated Substances:  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Other possible uses of chlorine are for iron removal.\nSubstance Handled or Stored:  Chlorine\nTotal Amount of Chlorine Stored:  16 one-ton containers, equivalent to 36,800 pounds.\n\nCAW conducted a Hazard Assessment for the Wilson WTP to determine the off-site conseqences of releases of chlorine and the results of the Hazard Assessment have been appropriately communicated with the local emergency response agencies.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe CAW's Wilson WTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive"

A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a \"What If\" analysis and has been recently updated utilizing a What-if/Checklist\" methodology. A compliance Audit was conducted in 2002 to verify the effectiveness of the program. \n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe CAW's Wilson WTP has never had a release of chlorine resulting in offsite injury or dispersion, or in onsite injury.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe CAW's Wilson WTP has an Emergency Response Program, which coordinates response efforts with the Little Rock Fire Department's HAZMAT team, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been discussed with the Arkansas Office of Emergency Services.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed during the hazard review that the CAW's Wilson WTP has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination system.  The following is recommended for improving the safety of the chlorination process:\n1. Implementation of a chlorine shipment quality assurance program."
