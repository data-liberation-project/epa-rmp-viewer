Carter-Wallace, Inc. leases approximately 18,000 square feet of  warehouse space within the Advance Distribution System facility.   The facility is a public warehouse located in Morrow, Georgia. Carter-Wallace employees one person at the warehouse to oversee the Carter -Wallace operations. The warehouse operates five days per week and eight hours per day.\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe operations affected by the risk management plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol product in consumer size containers. Product is moved throughout the warehouse via forklift trucks.\n\nVarious hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the aerosol product.  The hydrocarbons are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials. The  USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release associated with handling hazardous materials. The aerosol product propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Carter-Wallace operations at Advance Distribution System have not had any major release of product or accidents within the five year accident review period.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what is defined as a worst case release scenario. The worst case release scenario is defined as the sudden loss of containment of the product in the largest tank, vessel or container. The worst case release scenario assumes that several highly unlikely events occur simultaneously such as:\n\nCatastrophic failure of aerosol cans within a case;\nFailure of all automated safety and alarm systems;\nFailure of trained and experienced operators to respond appropriately; and\nThe event occurs during least lik"

      "SummaryText": "ely stagnant meteorological conditions.\n \nCarter-Wallace used USEPA developed guidance (Risk Management Program Guidance for Warehouses) to complete the modeling of the worst case release scenario.  The modeling shows that there would be no impact on the surrounding community.\n\nThese results classify the Carter-Wallace operations as a USEPA defined Program 1 facility.  A Program 1 facility, as defined by the USEPA, presents a minimal risk to the community\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nCarter-Wallace has developed programs to comply with the required environmental, health and safety standards. We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through:\n\nCompliance audits                                \nOperating procedures    \nAccident investigation \nTraining    \nEmployee participation\n\nIn addition to management programs, there are systems to control and mitigate potential accidental releases.  These include facility wide sprinkler system and portable fire extinguishers situated throughout the warehouse. The systems are routinely inspected. All of the forklift operators are properly trained. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCarter-Wallace has created a culture of continuous improvement of its safety program.  We train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  We also encourage suggested changes or improvements that will help minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment including the forklift trucks\n\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\n\nCarter-Wallace has an emergency response plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies. Our plan has been shared with local emergency response personnel.\n\nIn the event of an emergency affecting the local community, Carter-Wallace will work closely with local, county and stage agencies to help ensure public safety.  These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency."
