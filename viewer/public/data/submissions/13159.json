The City has used a proactive process of identification and evaluation to prevent and or control chemical releases.\nThe City's program involved a systematic aproach designed to critically evaluate all components of the chlorination processes: design, technology, operation, maintenance procedures, emergency plans, training programs, and other pertinant process elements. \nAfter evaluating the operations, the City took proactive steps to insure that inventories of chlorine at the site were managed efficiently and safety and training programs were updated. \nThe City of Apopka takes seriously its responsibility to operate its wastewater treatment plant in a safe manner and has therefore taken the above mentioned proactive measures.",

If an emergency were to occurr, it is our policy to notify 757, the City of Apopka Dispatcher, and request response to the emergency by our HazMat Team. Additional emergency response can be obtained through the Orange County HazMat Team, if necessary.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nThis facility is a municipal Water Reclamation Facility. Chlorine is used to disinfect our effluent which is used for public access reuse irrigation. Chlorine is used and stored in 1-ton cylinders (2000 pounds) in a covered building around the chlorinator system. The chlorinator system consist of four 1-ton chlorine cylinders on line at all times. From the on line chlorine cylinders, gaseus chlorine is injected under vacuum for water disinfection. A maximum of eight 1-ton cylinders are on hand at the Water Reclamation Facility. A chain link fence encloses the facilities operation.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nThe worst case scenario is the release of chlorine from the total failure of a 1-inch schedule 80 pipe connected to four 1-ton cylinders. This event is unlkely to occur and is presented here as required by the Risk Management Program regulations. The worst case scenario assumes that 1268 pounds of chlorine is released over a period of 27.1 minutes, resulting in a gaseous release of chlorine. In the event of a release, persons offsite would be affected.\nThe alternative release scenario is a more realistic accident that would involve the release of gaseous chlorine through a sheared or broken valve. The alternative case scenario assumes that1110 pounds of chlorine is released over "

      "SummaryText": "a period of 30 minutes, resulting in the gaseous release of chlorine. In the event of a release, persons offsite would be affected.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's PSM rule, and all applicable state and local codes andregulations. The chlorinator system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the Chlorine Institute and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection state regulations. The operators at the Water reclamation Facility are Florida State Certified proffessionals. To prepare for an emergency, plant operators have been trained in both respiratory protection and emergency action and fire protection. The operators have many years of experience safely handeling chlorine.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThe Apopka Water Reclamation facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that has caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nIn the event of an emergency involing the chlorinator system or the stored chlorine, it is our policy to call 757 ( the City of Apopka Dispatcher and request response to the emergency with our HazMat Team. Additional emergency response can be obtained through the Orange County HazMat Team, if necessary. We have discussed this policy with our Fire Departments who have also inspected our our chlorine system.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nThe City of Apopka Water Reclamation Facility has budgeted money for the fiscal year 99-00 to upgrade our chlorination system to chlorinators that mount directly to the 1-ton cylinders. This will completely reduce the risk of a leak in a transfer hose since they would be obsolete."
