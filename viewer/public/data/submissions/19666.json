This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, terminal trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Millis Terminal, located in Evanston, Wyoming, stores and ships propane, butane, and natural gasoline products.  Each product consists of several regulated flammables.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the terminal, is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing a butane product.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for the WCS is 0.66 mile.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the terminal is a VCE resulting from the release of propane from a product line (28,000 lbs released in 15 minutes).  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 15 minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.17 mile.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use on emergency planning and response.  \n\nThe Millis Terminal does not store or ship toxic regulated substances exceeding the threshold amounts.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention pr"

Because processes at the terminal that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPAs) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHAs) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Millis Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the terminal accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the terminal and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the terminal has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiates include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the terminal, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and terminal management.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Millis Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the terminal are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily ava"
