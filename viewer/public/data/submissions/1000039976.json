The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal startup,\r\nnormal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a\r\nturnaround or emergency shutdown. The information is readily available to operators and maintenance\r\npersonnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\r\n\r\nTraining \u00bf TVA\u00bfs training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in\r\nthe operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the\r\nprocess and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.
