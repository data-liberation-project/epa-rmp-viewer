The prevention program includes assuring all process\n\nequipment and materials meet appropriate standards and code\n\nrequirements, implementation of detailed safe operating procedures, and\n\neffective mechanical integrity program, and an extensive training program\n\nto assure that all personnel are thoroughly trained in the safe operation\n\nand maintenance of the ammonia system. Process controls include relief\n\nvalves, check valves, automatic and manual shutoffs, excess flow\n\ndevices, emergency power source, interlocks, alarms and procedures.\n\nSudden surges in flow or pressure will cause strategically located\n\nautomatic shutoff valves to close and isolate the system. Water fogging\n\nsprays located at relief valves and unloading station can be automatically\n\nactivated by area monitoring devices triggered at preset concentration\n\nlimits or manually activated by control room operators or storage facility\n\noperators.
