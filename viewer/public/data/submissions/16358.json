Ton containers of chlorine are used to sanitize produce wash water and propane is utilized for heating purposes in order to maintain optimum temperture and humidity of citrus storage.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\nThe worst case toxic gas release scenario is considered to be a ton container of chlorine releasing its entire contents in ten minutes.  The worst case flammable gas release scenario is assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the 10,000 gallon water capacity propane tank, which when filled to a maximum level of 88% as an administrative control, would involve a total quantity of 36,460 pounds of liquified propane which can possibly be released.  The released propane is assumed to form a vapor cloud and only 10% of the vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in an explosion.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative toxic gas release scenario is considered to be a ruptured valve on the chlorine ton container with a maximum release rate of 15 pounds per minute.  The alternative flammable gas release scenario is considered to be a propane delivery truck pulling away from the loading rack while still connected, and the released propane causing a vapor cloud fire.  The excess flow valve on the propane tank is assumed to function to stop the release and limit the released quantity of propane to only 69 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nJohnston Farms has integrated the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) requirements within a comprehensive environmental management system based on the \"One Plan\" format.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nJohnston Farms has not had an ac"
