Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSuperior Gas Liquids (SGL) is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of SGL's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at our facilities.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances. SGL does not maintain any employees at the rail storage facility, as the only 'process' in the context of this Risk Management Plan is butane storage in rail tank cars on rail siding leased from Montana Rail Link (MRL). As such, SGL depends upon and coordinates with MRL, the Plains-Paradise Rural Fire District, and the Sanders County Department of Emergency Management to provide response and response expertise.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility's primary activity is receiving, storage, and shipping Butane as liquified petroleum gas (LPG) in railcars. Railcars are placed by MRL on a rail siding, secured against unwanted movement and protected from collision with other cars/trains, stored for up to one (1) year, then picked up by MRL for transport to an oil refinery in Billings, Montana. Each 33,000-gallon capacity railcar contains up to 160,380 pounds of butane. Up to 180 rail cars may be stored on site; therefore, the maximum amount of butane stored at the facility is 28,868,400 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \n\nRMP*Comp was utilized to evaluate worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required off-site consequence analysis for the facility. Scenario details are included in Section 4 of this Plan and summarized below. Several factors protect tank car(s) from damage (e.g.,"

      "SummaryText": " from collision, vandalism, or attack) and subsequent uncontrolled release of butane. These DOT 112 tank cars are constructed from 0.6-inch fusion welded high tensile steel, jacketed for thermal protection, and have an outer steel skin. Testing performed by the Federal Railroad Administration (RR 14-30, August 2014) indicate they can withstand 2.1 million foot-pounds of impact energy from a one (1) ft2 ram. Tank cars will be protected from unintentional movement and collision by set handbrakes on parked cars and locked derailers at the ends of each siding track. All valves and fittings are located under a locked, protective steel housing on the top center of the tank. A pressure relief valve prevents overpressuring, and a safety check valve limits the flow rate from the loading/unloading valve. Reasonable release scenarios are limited to a malfunctioning valve(s) or fitting(s), or intentional release by partially opening the loading/unloading valve such that flow would not trigger the safety check valve.\n\n\n\nA worst-case release scenario involves the release of the entire contents of all tank cars stored at the facility (28,868,400 pounds) and ignition of the resulting vapor cloud. Administrative controls or mitigation that would affect the release rate were not included in this scenario. At Stability Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and air temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), the maximum distance to an endpoint of one (1) pounds per square inch (psi) overpressure (endpoint fixed by regulation) is 2.5 miles (Figure 1). A census search of population within a 2.5-mile radius using CensusViewer reports 214 persons.\n\n\n\nAn alternative release scenario involves the release of the entire contents of one (1) tank car. In the alternative scenario, 160,380 pounds of butane is released and the resulting vapor cloud ignited. The release is assumed to be undetected while ongoing and at a rate that does not trigger the flow-limiting check v"

A census search of population within a 0.4-mile radius using CensusViewer reports 163 persons.\n\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSGL will take all steps necessary to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place for the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nSGL will maintain a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (see Appendix A - SDS, DOT 112 Rail Car Spec).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA hazard analysis was completed as part of this Plan. Major hazards identified include fire and explosion. Process controls include the following:\n\n?    Railcar construction that is resistant to puncture and heat;\n\n?    Locked protective housings over all valves and fittings to discourage unauthorized access;\n\n?    Pressure relief valves to prevent tank over-pressuring; and,\n\n?    Safety check valves to limit flow rate and prevent uncontrolled release of tank contents to atmosphere.\n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSGL will maintain written operating procedures to ensure that activities within the covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures will address various modes of operation. The information will be regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes (see Appendix B - Operating Procedures).\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nSGL depends on MRL to safely deliver tank cars into storage, secure them against unwanted movement, protect them from collisions, and remove the"

MRL has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that their employees involved in these processes are trained to an adequate level of competency.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSGL relies on The Tank Car Supplier, the manufacturer and owner of the rail cars leased by SGL, to conduct maintenance and testing that assures mechanical integrity. SGL requires that any cars leased from The Tank Car Supplier are maintained in accordance with applicable regulatory and industry standards (e.g., 49 CFR Part 180 Subpart F - Qualification and Maintenance of Tank Cars, and Association of American Railroads Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices, Section C-III, Specifications for Tank Cars). The Tank Car Supplier maintains detailed maintenance records.\n\n\n\nThe Tank Car Supplier performs inspections at a frequency of at least every 10 years. Where manufacturers of valves and fittings recommend a shorter inspection interval, The Tank Car Supplier follows the manufacturers recommendation. Inspections and testing include bubble leak tests, ultrasonic testing of weld seams, thickness gaging, heat testing, and bench testing of valves prior to installation and at the manufacturer-recommended frequency.\n\n\n\nSGL also performs, or causes to be performed, inspections to ensure tank cars have been delivered secure and leak-free. Visual inspections are performed to confirm cable seals and/or padlocks are present and intact on the protective housing covering valves and fittings. A gas detector is used to confirm the absence of leakage from valves and fittings. Security and leak inspections are typically performed within seven (7) days of railcar delivery (see Appendix C - Maintenance).\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nNo process changes are reasonably anticipated.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup review is limited to ensuring the rail siding is in serviceable condition. MRL is responsible for maintaining its track and associated infrastructure in accordance with its rail ma"

SGL encourages its employees to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. Although SGL will not have any employees directly involved in the processes covered under this Plan, SGL expects its partners, MRL and The Tank Car Supplier, to similarly foster a proactive safety culture within their organizations. In addition, SGL will ensure that MRL and its employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSuperior Liquid Gas will conduct incident investigations as required by 40 CFR 68.60 for incidents that resulted in a catastrophic release or that could have resulted in a catastrophic release.\n\n\n\n5.
