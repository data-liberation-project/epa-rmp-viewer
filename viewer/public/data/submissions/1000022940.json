Because processes at Penford that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA\u00c2\u00bfs (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary and the subsequent section on emergency response address each of the OSHA PSM elements and describe the management system in place to implement the accidental prevention program.\n\n1.\tEmployee Participation\n\nIt is PenfordA\u00c2\u00bfs policy to utilize the most knowledgeable and experienced resources available in the execution of its process safety and accident prevention programs.  To accomplish this, Penford encourages (and at times requires) contractors and employees at all levels of the organization to participate in these programs.  Operating unit personnel participate in hazard studies, incident investigations, periodic audits, and management of change reviews.  Several committees with operator and contractor participation are responsible for the development of related programs and procedures.  Written policies reinforce the importance of employee participation and ensure process-related information is made available to those involved.  All employees (including field personnel) actively participate in PenfordA\u00c2\u00bfs safety process.\n\n2.\tProcess Safety Information/Trade Secrets\n\nRecognizing the importance of developing and maintaining technical documentation, Penford has established documentation standards.

Materials of construction, design specifications, safe operating limits, operating and maintenance procedures, chemical safety information, and other key information are collected or developed to ensure the process operates safely and that consequences of deviations are understood.  Maintenance, operating, emergency shutdown, and emergency response procedures are developed and maintained. Penford ensures that its processes are maintained within their process limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown and safety systems).\n\nAlthough Penford chose not to re-register under ISO 9001:2000, process-related information is managed using ISO-compliant practices to ensure it is readily available and properly updated. A process information index helps direct personnel to the appropriate documents.  PenfordA\u00c2\u00bfs access to information policy ensures process safety information is available to all personnel working in or affected by the process.\n\n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nPenford utilizes team-based hazard analysis techniques to ensure all potential hazards are identified and multiple levels of protection are in place to prevent an incident and associated off site consequences.  Teams with engineers, operators, mechanics and safety professionals spend weeks evaluating each component and procedure of each process.  If new processes are developed, hazard evaluations are conducted at each phase of the design and construction.  Multiple hazard evaluation techniques including hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, fault tree analysis, and failure mode and effects analysis, are utilized.

Only trained and qualified mechanics or contractors perform maintenance on PSM processes.\n\nQuality assurance procedures have been established to ensure only specified repair parts are ordered and installed on the processes.  Plant design standards (meeting or exceeding recommended industry practices), tight purchasing specifications, and incoming material inspections ensure the correct part is ordered and received.  A parts identification system and a secured stockroom help ensure the proper parts are issued to a job. Documented maintenance procedures and contractor/mechanic training ensure the part is properly installed.\n\n10.\tSafe Work Practices\n\nPenford has effective safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  A sophisticated card access security system, video surveillance, and 24-hour security guards help ensure only authorized personnel have access to the site.  Penford's Energy Isolation and Line Breaking procedures ensure process equipment is safe prior to performing repairs.  Confined Space Entry and Hot Work Programs require careful review prior to issuance of permits allowing the performance of these activities.  Penford works with local emergency response agencies to ensure they are familiar with its safe work practices and to ensure that a well-trained second line of defense is readily available.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely."

A team-based approach is typically utilized to ensure an in-depth, unbiased investigation is conducted.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify the root causes, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to reduce the probability of a recurrence, prioritizes recommendations, and assigns responsibilities.  An action item database is maintained to ensure corrective actions are completed on a timely basis and appropriate documentation is maintained.  All incidents/near misses and corrective actions are shared with all affected personnel to help minimize the potential for recurrence.  The well-managed incident investigation process serves as a valuable input for the periodic hazard analyses.\n\n12.\tCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure the process safety and accident prevention program is functioning properly, Penford periodically conducts comprehensive audits.  To ensure the audits provide adequate coverage, the OSHA Program Quality Verification (PQV) guidelines are used to establish minimum audit requirements.  Additional areas of focus are included based on an evaluation of previous audit results, previous incidents, changes to the process, and additional OSHA/EPA guidance or clarifications.  To ensure the audits accurately reflect the program effectiveness, employee interviews, written documentation reviews, and process observations are included.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of any hazardous substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition Penford has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties including sheltering-in-place and evacuation.  Penford employees that may be involved in a threatened or actual chemical spill response are required to complete a minimum of 24-hour course in Industrial Chemical Spill Response.  These personnel must recertify annually with an 8-hour refresher course. Penford workers will respond to minor events that do not have the potential for significant effects (e.g., small fires or small leaks).  In the event of a larger fire or release, workers evacuate the area and contact the Cedar Rapids Fire Department (HAZMAT).\n\nPenford's emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Penford plant processes or other Penford plant facilities.

The computer-based system ensures recommendations are documented, and responsibilities assigned; a written schedule for completing action is developed; action is taken and documented; and action is communicated to affected personnel. \n\n4.\tManagement of Change\n\nTo ensure proposed changes to processes are properly evaluated before they are implemented, Penford has developed an effective management of change program.  All proposed changes are carefully evaluated by engineers, operators, safety professionals, and site management to ensure a change does not introduce an unforeseen hazard nor exacerbate off site consequences.  Changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other process changes are subject to the management of change review.  When changes are implemented, operating and maintenance procedures are updated, employees and mechanics are trained, documentation is updated, and stores/inventory systems are updated.  To ensure this occurs and the installation is completed as designed, a pre-startup safety review is conducted.\n\n5.\tOperating Procedures\n\nPenford maintains detailed written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.

This coordination includes quarterly meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Penford has been an active member of the committee and has worked with the Linn County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) in developing and exercising the county-wide Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan (Annex P).  Penford has around the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department) and LEPC officials.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Penford conducts periodic emergency drills for all facility personnel and has worked with both the LEPC and emergency response organizations on county-wide chemical emergency response training.  Penford involves local responders in refresher training on the hazards of regulated substances in the Penford facility. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPenford constantly strives to improve its safety performance and minimize potential impact on the environment.  Active safety and environmental teams and committees, routine audits and inspections, an effective incident investigation procedure, routine PHAA\u00c2\u00bfs, and community involvement all provide input on improvement opportunities.  Some of the improvements currently planned include:\n\nUpgrades to several existing fire protection systems\nUpgrades to existing computer-based process control systems\nUpgrades to several piping systems\nUpgrades to plant infrastructure\nImprove utilization of Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) in Mechanical Integrity Program\nUse of computer-based-tra"

In addition, PenfordA\u00c2\u00bfs distributed control systems (DCS) which control the process  equipment have been programmed with safety interlocks that run in parallel and oversee normal operations providing yet another layer of protection.  \n\n6.\tTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures, Penford has developed a comprehensive training program for all of its employees and contractors.  New employees are required to complete a new hire orientation prior to assignment in the facility.  After successfully completing the new hire orientation, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  The new operator must demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner prior to working independently.  In addition, all operators must successfully complete periodic refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  \n\nPrior to working at Penford, contractors are required to certify that their employees have successfully completed required safety training.  Penford then provides additional training to every contractor employee prior to his or her assignment within the plant.  \n\nA computer-based training management package helps keep track of training for employees and contractors and makes sure refresher training is completed as required.  Contractors are issued photo training cards, and are required to present them when performing certain activities in the plant.  Significant investments in training tiem, including a computer interactive training system, and hands-on training facilities help ensure the training is effective.\n\n7.\tContractors\n\nContractors pla"

Prior to working at the facility, potential contractors must pre-qualify, describing their management structure, insurance coverage, training process, historical safety performance, and a wide range of other pertinent information.  If the contractor meets PenfordA\u00c2\u00bfs stringent requirements, each contractor employee must attend Penford's contractor safety training.  This training includes a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices.  If successfully completed, the contractor employee is issued a training card valid for three years.  The contractor employee can be qualified for other activities (such as hot work or line breaking) if they successfully complete that training.  A committee, with Penford and contractor representatives, periodically audits each contractor's safety performance and their overall safety process.  \n\n8.\tPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nPenford conducts a Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new process or significant process modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all support systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n \n9.\tMechanical Integrity\n\nPenford has well-established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment in a safe operating condition.
