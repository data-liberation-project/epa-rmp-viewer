The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Bulk Fertilizer Plant in Wentzville are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Wentzville Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer, chemicals, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as pest control and crop nutrients.\n\n    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 84,118 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank. Product will be received by tanker trucks which typically hold 50,000 pounds.  The facility also has a 12,000 gallon storage tank that when filled will hold approximately 56,078 pounds.  There are twenty-one 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that when filled would hold approximately 91,035 pounds.  Also, there are four 560 gallon \napplicator tanks that when filled would hold 9,710 pounds.  \nTherefore, the facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 240,941 pounds.  \n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will work to meet new codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydro"
