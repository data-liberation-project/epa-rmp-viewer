      "SummaryText": "The OX facility stores more than 10,000 pounds of a flammable mixture that meets the criteria for listing under CAA section 112(r). The facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program due to storage of over 10,000 pounds of a flammable liquid. Ox has developed and implemented the PSM program.\n\n\n\nPer USEPA guidance, the worst-case consequence analysis was performed for the isopentane constituent of the cyclopentane mixture. Modeling results indicate the worst case release would cause an offsite impact. Therefore, OX is subject to Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n\nBecause of the potential hazards when using isopentane, it is essential that steps be taken to minimize the risk of a catastrophic release. OX meets the prevention program requirements for a Program 3 process under the OSHA PSM standard. Specifically, process safety information, operating procedures, pre startup safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, contractors, and management of change contribute to safe operation of the system.\n\n\n\nOX has developed and implemented many standard operating procedures for the process covered under the OSHA PSM requirements. These procedures outline steps for each operating phase, operating limits, health and safety considerations, as well as safety systems and their functions. The procedures outline safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations. The process complies with good engineering practices, and procedures are in place for maintaining mechanical integrity and planning for change. Employees are trained in safe operations, health and safety hazards, and emergency procedures with respect to their job tasks. \n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted by the facility helps to identify potential problems before they occur. This process allows for participation of employees and identification of opportunities for improvement at the plan"

      "SummaryText": "t. The most recent PHA conducted by the plant identified no major deficiencies in the pentane system. The PHA did not identify an impending release of pentane, based on the operation and maintenance of the systems. Employee participation is also a key component of the successful implementation of the PSM program at OX.\n\n\n\nThe hazard analysis performed for the facility also includes a review of its 5 year accident history. OX has been the operator at the Charleston facility since late December of 2012 when it began leasing the facility from The Dow Chemical Company (Dow). OX purchased the facility, then in February 2018, a private equity firm, Wind Point Partners purchased the OX operation. Since occupancy, OX has not had an accidental release that met the criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a). \n\n\n\nOX is a Program 3 source and a non-responding facility. OX's Emergency Action Plan outlines procedures for internal response to incidental releases, and notification and coordination with the local emergency response organizations in the event of an incidental release that cannot be contained and will have offsite impacts.
