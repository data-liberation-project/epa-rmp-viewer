Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Grandin Coop Oil in Grandin are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental\nsafety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Grandin Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in two interconnected 30,000-gallon tanks at our facility in Grandin (Figure 1).  The\nmaximum amount stored is 51,000 gallons (262,446 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (262,446 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-\nminute period.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the\nmaximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 7.5 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated\npopulation wi"

The\nscenario involves the release of 8621.11 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 200.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nGrandin Coop Oil maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\nhazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nGrandin Coop Oil maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered\nprocesses are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nGrandin Coop Oil has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nGrandin Coop Oil conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\noperation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in\nmaintenance prac"

Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Grandin Coop Oil to manage changes in process chemicals,\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nGrandin Coop Oil routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\nequipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nGrandin Coop Oil conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's\nprovisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue\ndiscovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nGrandin Coop Oil truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team\neffort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all\ninformation created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information\nresulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nGrandin Coop Oil has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. \nDue to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this\nperiod.\n\n  6.
