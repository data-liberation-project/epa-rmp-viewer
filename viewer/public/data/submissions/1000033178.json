The plant has a safety program designed to ensure that the employees' working environment is safe.  This program includes training and instruction.\r\n\r\nThe process at the coal fired steam electric generating facility subject to the RMP regulations is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  This system is part of the Selective Catalytic Reductions system used to control emissions of nitrogen oxides generated from burning coal to produce electricity.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program at Plant Gorgas is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage an dilution system.  The first step in the prevention program was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include: ensuring process safety information on the ammonia storage and dilution is accurate, complete, up to date and accessible, ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified, and oriented to the site hazards; and ensuring periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations are conducted including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.\r\n\r\nNo chemical spills have occurred at this facility in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nPlant Gorgas is included in the Walker County LEPC emergency response plan.
