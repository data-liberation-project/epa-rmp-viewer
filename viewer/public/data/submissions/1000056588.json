The ammonia source for the SCRs is aqueous ammonia with an ammonia concentration of 30 percent by weight.   The aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at the facility is comprised of a single storage tank, pumps, piping, and a vaporizer. Following the vaporizer, there are two blowers (one for each SCR) that deliver the vaporized ammonia stream to the SCRs. The tank is a horizontally-oriented cylindrical tank, rounded on each end. The tank is constructed of carbon steel which is compatible with aqueous ammonia. The tank has a total capacity of 16,000 gallons and is equipped with pressure relief valves, a flame arrestor, and temperature, pressure and level indicators. The maximum capacity of the tank is administratively limited to 15,000 gallons. The tank is installed within a concrete secondary containment structure. The containment structure has a surface area of 1,124 square feet (53.5 feet by 21 feet) and a wall height of 3.5 feet.  The piping from the tank to the vaporizer is also carbon steel, 1 to 2 inches in diameter, depending on the service.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\r\nThe facility has onsite spill prevention and control procedures, including daily visual inspections and planned maintenance activities, which help to reduce the potential for hazardous material releases to the soil or surface waters. The following provides a summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\r\n1) Discharge Detection by Personnel - The facility operators perform a visual inspection of the facility during each shift. During the inspection, deficiencies are noted on a checklist and corrections are initiated either immediately or a work request is generated depending on the nature of the problem. \r\n2) Ammonia Automatic Detection - Automatic ammonia vapor electronic warning sensors are installed on the ammonia storage tank and skids.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe Desert Star Energy Center (facility) is located approximately 15 miles southwest of Boulder City, Nevada.  The RMP is expected to change and evolve as the facility changes, as new information on chemical hazards is developed, as the affected system is modified, and as the surrounding community changes. The aqueous ammonia storage and handling process at the facility was identified as the only process that triggers RMP requirements. This process is covered under the federal RMP Program 2 requirements, based on the storage of 15,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia with an ammonia concentration of 30 percent by weight.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES:\r\nThe Desert Star Energy Center has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and is committed to operating and maintaining all of the processes in a safe and responsible manner. To help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment, The Desert Star Energy Center has implemented a combination of accident release prevention programs and emergency action planning programs. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to employees, the public, and the environment. The Desert Star Energy Center management is committed to providing appropriate training to employees and coordinating action activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers to ensure a safe operation.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\nThe facility is an electric generating station consisting of one 175 megawatt (MW) steam turbine and two 165 MW combustion turbine generators capable of generating 480 MW of electricity. The two 165 MW turbines burn pipeline quality sweet dry natural gas exclusively and are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems for the control of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. The SCRs employ ammonia"

Should an alarm be triggered, the procedures outlined in the Desert Star Energy Center Policies and Procedures Manual will be initiated as appropriate. Once an initial assessment is made, the appropriate action of either shutting down the piece of equipment or initiating a clean up of discharged material should be performed. Based on this assessment, minor releases within the facility will be immediately contained and cleaned with either absorbent material or rags or additional clean-up personnel and equipment may be dispatched to the site and deployed to control and contain the spill. \r\n3) Ammonia Loading/Unloading Procedures - In order to assist in the prevention of an accidental release of ammonia, the Desert Star Energy Center implements a standard operating procedure (SOP) for ammonia loading and unloading procedures. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY:\r\nThere have been no accidents involving the release of aqueous ammonia in the past five years or since the original RMP was developed in 1999.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:\r\nThere have been no significant changes to Desert Star Energy Center's emergency action program since the RMP was originally developed in 1999 other than emergency contact information.
