Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Golden State Vintners Winery, located at 7409 West Central Avenue, Fresno, California handles anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous materials that are regulated substances and are considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of ammonia and sulfur dioxide make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle ammonia and sulfur dioxide; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Golden State Vinters Winery uses ammonia in their cooling system to aid in heat removal during the fermenting process and in the cooling process to chill and store the wine.  The heat exchangers are flooded with anhydrous ammonia and heat from the wine is released into the ammonia.  This heated ammonia is compressed with additional heat generated in the ammonia.  The heat in the ammonia is removed when the ammonia is cooled in the condenser giving off it's heat to the water and air flows in the condenser.  The largest container for the anhydrous ammonia is a high pressure receiver with 11,000 lb.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered in bulk by a commercial ammonia supplier for use at the facility.  The off-loading is done in accordance with the supplier off-loading procedures.  The ammonia is stored in the refrigeration equipment.  Sulfur dioxide is used in the grape crushing process to prohibit the growth of bacteria; and in the stored wine to control bacteria and pH in the stored wine.  The sulfur dioxide is "

      "SummaryText": " delivered by a commercial supplier in 150 lb and one-ton containers.  The sulfur dioxide is repackaged into 30 lb and 100 lb containers for use in the wine tanks at the facility.   The sulfur dioxide containers are stored near the crush pad.  The largest container for the sulfur dioxide is one-ton container.\n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substances are considered as part of one complete process.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe one-ton sulfur dioxide container is the largest vessel size in the sulfur dioxide system.   The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one-ton sulfur dioxide cylinder assumes that the full cylinder of sulfur dioxide is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 200 pounds per minute. The distance to the endpoint of  .078 mg/l for the Worst Case scenario is 3.1 miles.  This sulfur dioxide release extends beyond the boundaries of winery.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for sulfur dioxide for the one-ton container located at the facility assumes a release from a valve packing, resulting in an estimated release of no more than 2 pounds per minute.  The period of release is taken to be one hour in duration, resulting in a total release quantity of 120 pounds of sulfur dioxide. The distance to the endpoint of  .078 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario is 0.5 mile.  This sulfur dioxide release extends beyond the boundaries of the winery.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for anhydrous ammonia for the one-ton container located at the facility assumes a release from a compressor pressure relief valve, resulting in a release of 105.8 pounds per minute.  The period of release is taken to be one hour in duration, resulting in a total release quantity of 6,348 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The distance to the endpoint of  .14 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario is 0.2 mile.  This anhydrous ammonia release extends beyond the boundaries of the winery."

      "SummaryText": "\n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia systems and the training provided to the operators.\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably not to have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the ammonia system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n \n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of ammonia or sulfur dioxide within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Golden State Vintners facility's Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Mid Valley Fire Department Fire at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Fresno County Health Department can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Manage"
