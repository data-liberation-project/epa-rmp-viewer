(ORM - Owner/Operator)\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nONEOK Rockies Midstream, L.L.C. (ORM) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. The following is a statement from ONEOK Partners, L.P. (ONEOK - Parent Company) Senior Management.  ONEOK believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees.  Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures.  Employees of ORM are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies.  Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Grasslands Complex (Facility), located in McKenzie County, North Dakota, uses cryogenic fractionation and amine absorption to process sour wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL).  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances and one toxic substance are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and natural gas condensate).  There are four 72,506 gal (305,975 lbs) propane, three 61,539 gal (323,079 lbs) natural gasoline, four 42,007gals (202,893 lbs) butane, one 29,99"

The Grasslands Complex does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.  However the plant does remove and dispose of the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) present in the raw wellhead gas by compression into an approved injection well just outside of the plant boundary, but located on Company owned property.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nProcesses at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) risk management program regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and PSM elements management system are in place to implement EPAs accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Grasslands Complex have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Grasslands Complex has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n*  Release Detection\n\n*  Daily Operator Inspection\n\n*  Fixed Point Monitors for H2S and Combustible Gas\n\n*  Fire Detection with Shut-Down\n\n*  Release Containment/Control\n\n*  Process Relief Valves that Prevent Vessel Over Pressurization\n\n*  Valves to Permit Isolation of the Process (manual or automated)\n\n*  Automated Shutdown Systems for Specific Process Parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n*  Curbing or Diking to contain Liquid Releases\n\n*  Redundant Equipment and Instrumentation (e.g., emergency power supply, backup pumps,"

Releases that did occur at the facility involving a regulated substance, were quickly contained and resulted in no deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Grasslands Complex maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in plant monthly emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response. \n\n\n\nThe ERP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other ONEOK facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Grasslands Complex is coor"

The local responder for plant emergencies is the Richland County Volunteer Fire Department and Richland Co. Sheriff Department under an agreement for mutual aid with the McKenzie County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The Grasslands Complex has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, sheriff office).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA corporate wide electronic MOC process has been implemented to create a more consistent and comprehensive method for managing changes.  An electronic PSSR process has been implemented to ensure all aspects of physical changes are reviewed for safe and compliant installation prior to startup.  The PHA revalidation was redone as a HAZOP  in 2020.   Future PHAs will be conducted as HAZOP with LOPA and risk assessment in accordance with company standards.\n\n"
