NEWPORT, MN 55055 . 651-459-5555 . 651-459-5951 (FAX)\r\n\r\n\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nNovember 1, 2005\r\n\r\nNewport St. Paul Cold Storage was established in 1959 as a public refrigerated warehouse serving frozen and refrigerated food companies storage needs. Newport St. Paul Cold Storage has a modern single story facility with an updated refrigeration system. Our two stage refrigeration system utilizes over 20,000 lbs. of ammonia (anhydrous). The key individuals involved in the day to day operations are Andrew R. Greenberg, President, Robert Franklin, Executive Vice President, Randy Lewis, Director of Operations, Jim Clark, Chief Engineer, and Bill Paquet, Maintenance. \r\n\r\nNewport St. Paul Cold Storage has an on-going safety program, which includes ammonia safety, prevention, and emergency response. We are a member of the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses. We utilize the resources of the IARW for information, education, and training. We invest significant time and money into maintaining our refrigeration system and facilities. Over the course of the last year we have made significant refrigeration operation and safety enhancements by investing in a technologically advance energy management system with remote accessibility by key personnel, additional ammonia detection in each room, and 24 hour direct alert. Our Chief Engineer handles most day to day operations of our refrigeration system. Each year we review, repair, and audit all critical refrigeration components. In addition, our Chief Engineer receives annual training with regards to emergency response. Bill Paquet has received certification for 24 hour Crisis Training for ammonia. We utilize the services of a qualified ammonia refrigeration contractor for major repairs.\r\n\r\nThrough efforts of Newport St. Paul Cold Storage\u00bfs Safety committee we have a detailed emergency response plan. We have developed easy to use manuals to help with the details"

      "SummaryText": "of the ERP. Our plan includes a flow chart of individual responsibilities, emergency phone numbers, a summarized Crisis Management procedures, containment and repair procedures, and decontamination procedures. We provide the Newport Fire Department with our Crisis Management manual and facility layout. Each year we initiate a facility walk through with the entire NFD department.  Our Chief Engineer and Maintenance personnel have the initial 24 hour certification for Emergency Response training and each year they are sent to the 8 hour refresher training. In addition, they are trained each year to use all the personal protective gear and devices; ammonia indicator, suit, respirators, and safety harness. NCS has certain employee\u00bfs trained in CPR and first aid. Safety training is provided to each of our employee\u00bfs through company safety meetings. \r\n\r\nOver the course of the last 5 years we have had one ammonia vapor leak. On June 5, 2005 at 6:30 PM our Chief Engineer sensed there was an engine room issue because he could not communicate with our energy management system remotely. He determined that there was a vapor leak in the facility and called Gartner Refrigeration, Bill Paquet, Randy Lewis, and Andrew Greenberg.  Based on no wind direction there was no need to evacuate the building or surrounding areas. The refrigeration system was pressurized and the vapor began to dissipate.  The highest level of ammonia measured was 105 ppm. Through air ventilation within an hour the ammonia concentration level significantly decreased. We determined at a later time that the mechanical failure was due to an undetectable small crack in a defrost pan. We did not know at the time what ammonia was lossed. In the morning we determined that we lost less than 950 Lbs. In the morning of June 6 the ammonia ppm was measured at 3-5 ppm. There were no injuries or deaths. \r\n\r\nIt is in NCS\u00bfs best interest to provide for the safest work environment for our employees, customers, and shareholders"
