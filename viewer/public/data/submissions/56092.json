Specific topics covered during the employee review of safe VAM handling procedures include, but are not limited to, the following information:  product transfer modes and affected facility equipment, VAM technical and physical properties, inhibitor specifications and periodic verification, nitrogen blanketing to maintain low oxygen levels, special product hazards and warnings, required personal protective equipment (PPE), and environmental/regulatory considerations.  VAM has been successfully handled at Stolthaven Houston Inc. to date without significant incident; this December of 2009 RMP update represents a consolidation of VAM storage at the facility from two tanks into a single tank.  \n\nAs a result of the upcoming VAM storage project in Tank P50-5, piping modifications were recently completed in various facility manifolds and at the storage tank itself to eliminate the use of hoses in VAM service to the greatest extent possible within the terminal.  Stolthaven Houston's permanent, stationary fire-water protection systems are also in the process of being upgraded to provide additional cooling water as-needed in the event of an emergency incident involving the facility's flammable liquid storage tanks.  Existing portable water delivery systems are adequate until such time as these permanent system modifications are completed.\n\nAs referenced above, Stolthaven Houston Inc. recently terminated the storage of Acrylonitrile (a RMP regulated toxic substance) in Low-Pressure Storage Tank P50-6.  Acrylonitrile storage in Tank P50-6 represented a previously covered process at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal that is no longer subject to regulation under the 40 CFR Part 68 requirements as Acrylonitrile is no longer stored or transferred on-site.

      "SummaryText": "PURPOSE FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN RESUBMISSION / UPDATE\n\nStolthaven Houston Inc. is updating the facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP) in December of 2009 to (1) reflect a new operating scenario for a regulated toxic substance present at the facility above the applicable threshold quantity in a newly covered process and to (2) delete the operating scenario for a previously represented covered process that is no longer subject to Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) requirements.  The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n- Updating the RMP pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR 68, Section \u00a7 68.190(b)(4), due to Stolthaven Houston Inc. commencing the storage and associated marine parcel shipments of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) in existing Storage Tank P50-5 for the first time above the threshold quantity for VAM of 15,000-pounds, and\n\n- Removing Acrylonitrile storage and associated product shipments from the list of processes at Stolthaven Houston Inc. that are currently applicable to the RMP requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  Acrylonitrile is not currently stored or transferred at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \n\n\n\u00a768.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes involved in chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to protect the environment and to help ensure the safety of our employees as well at the citizens of the surrounding communities.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Stolthaven Houston Inc. has designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and the substances regulated by 40 CFR Part 68 that are currently handled on-site\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year ac"

Bulk liquid products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes of transportation cargo containers that can include tank trucks, ISO tank containers, rail tank cars, barges, and/or marine parcel tankers (ships).  These products are stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and are subsequently transferred off-site through one of more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  Direct transfer of TDI from marine vessels to rail tank cars is also performed at Stolthaven Houston Inc. with no intermediate storage.  Stolthaven Houston Inc. currently has over 15-years of experience in the storage and handling of TDI.\n\nSimilarly, Isopentane, n-Pentane, and pentane blends are also periodically transloaded directly between land-based transportation containers (i.e. tank trucks, ISO tank containers, and rail tank cars) at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with no intermediate product storage.  TDI and VAM currently represent the only two RMP regulated substances at Stolthaven Houston Inc. that are present above their corresponding threshold quantities at all times.

After initial system commissioning via tank truck delivery, VAM has subsequently been received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal via barges discharging into either of two existing 15,000-barrel capacity internal floating roof (IFR) Storage Tanks:  Tank A15-9 and Tank A15-10.  The stored VAM is then shipped outbound according to customer requirements via marine parcel tankers that load at Stolthaven Houston's existing Ship Dock 2/3.  \n\nIn December of 2009 Stolthaven Houston Inc. will consolidate the terminal's existing VAM storage previously housed in IFR Storage Tanks A15-9 and A15-10 into a different tank at the facility, IFR Storage Tank P50-5, that has been specifically prepared for the upcoming VAM service.  Storage Tank P50-5 is an existing IFR tank at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with a maximum working capacity of approximately 50,142-barrels, which corresponds to a maximum VAM storage capacity of just under 16,365,000-pounds.  Once all VAM is removed from Storage Tanks A15-9 and A15-10, these two tanks will be gas-freed, cleaned, inspected, modified as necessary, and returned to active service storing a different product that is not covered under the current 40 CFR 68 regulations.  As such, Storage Tanks A15-9 and A15-10 will no longer be covered processes under the RMP rules.\n\nEmployee training related to the specifics of VAM storage and transfer at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was first conducted in December of 2008 and then again in April of 2009 in preparation of originally receiving this RMP regulated substance into the facility earlier this year.
