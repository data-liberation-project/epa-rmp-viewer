CUSA is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it operates.  That commitment is documented in the vision and values outlined in CUSA Corporate Policy, \"The Chevron Way - Getting Results the Right Way.\" CUSA's vision is \"to be the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance.\" The Chevron Way value of \"Protecting People and the Environment\" places the highest priority on the health and safety of the workforce (employees and contractors) and protection of the environment and assets.  CUSA policies, procedures and guidelines can be accessed by all employees on the company intranet.\n\n\n\nTo achieve and sustain its Vision CUSA has developed Tenets of Operation, a tool used by the workforce to guide daily decisions.  Leaders play an important role in setting expectations and reinforcing behaviors consistent with the tenets.  The Tenets of Operation are based on two key principles\n\n\n\nDo it safely or not at all; and\n\nThere's always time to do it right.\n\n\n\nB. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Refinery is located in the City of Richmond, Contra Costa County, State of California. The Refinery is the largest refinery in the Bay Area with a capacity of 245,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The Refinery covers approximately 2,900 acres. There are approximately 1,300 CUSA employees at the Refinery, routinely augmented by contractors. Contractors are not used to operate or monitor process equipment.\n\n \n\nThe Refinery is located on a peninsula bordered by the San Francisco Bay to the north and west, the San Pablo Bay to the northeast, an acid regeneration facility to the east and the City of Richmond to the east and south. Point Molate and the Quarry Products Company are situated nearby on the western edge of the peninsula, the Parr-Richmond Terminal Corporation is loca"

The area immediately surrounding the refinery is nearly all industrial except for the neighborhoods of Point Richmond to the south, Atchison Village to the southeast, North Richmond to the northeast, and the Iron Triangle to the east.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery's primary business is to make transportation fuels from crude oil. The transportation fuel products produced at the Refinery include gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. The Refinery also produces lubricating oils and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Several byproducts are produced by the Refinery's production processes, including sulfur and anhydrous ammonia, which are recovered from sulfur and nitrogen contained in the crude oil. The substances present at the refinery that are regulated by the federal RMP include flammable hydrocarbons and ammonia (NH3).\n\n\n\nC. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1. Management System \n\nThe Refinery's senior managers have the overall responsibility for adherence to all federal, state, county and city regulations/ordinances. RMP and PSM are similar in their requirements. The Refinery's management system provides a framework to ensure Refinery personnel can integrate all of the regulatory requirements into Refinery work processes. \n\n\n\nLeadership \n\nThe single largest factor for success is leadership. The Refinery's leaders are focused not only on getting results, but getting results the right way with behaviors in accordance with Chevron's values. They are accountable for stewarding the Refinery's RMP processes, and for both enabling and delivering performance. \n\n\n\nBy their actions, the Refinery's leaders: \n\n- Cascade, manage and drive execution; \n\n- Reinforce the process safety culture; \n\n- Instill operational discipline - \"every task the right way, every time;\" and\n\n- Ensure that they and the entire Refinery "

Refinery Instructions (RIs) are the primary method of setting and communicating expectations for the prevention program elements at the Refinery. These instructions are available on the Refinery Information Server, which is the Refinery's internal web page with pertinent information accessible to all personnel.

As part of the RI update process, all employees are given an opportunity to share input on potential changes. PSM-related RI's also include consultation with the United Steel Workers Union. After all feedback is received, changes are made. The RI is reviewed and approved by the owning manager, then  forwarded to senior managers for approval before taking effect. Refinery employees responsible for RI modifications must communicate those changes to all affected employees.\n\n\n\nVision \n\nThe Refinery's management system begins with defining a vision of success and setting objectives.

The questionnaire includes confirmation that the company has an established written safety program, job qualification employee requirements, a program for random drug and alcohol testing, initial and refresher training programs, a behavioral based safety process and a short service employee program. Metrics, such as Total Recordable Incident Rate, are also considered when selecting contract companies. Contracts Administration may also request that the contract owner submit additional documentation, such as safety training records/logs. The contractor office field audit process also includes verification of appropriate skills and certification required to perform the job.

This pre-planning activity ensures that the members of the responding agencies are familiar with the Refinery, the hazards of the regulated substances, the resources available at the Refinery, and the locations of these resources.
