The contractor program ensures that safety issues are addressed during contractor selection and that CUSA and the contract company share responsibility for the safety of all employees. The Refinery and all contract companies are jointly responsible for safety and must ensure that contractor's employees are trained in and understand the following:\r\n- Work practices necessary to perform the job;\r\n- Hazards associated with a process;\r\n- Applicable sections of the emergency response procedure; and\r\n- Applicable safe work practices\r\n\r\nCUSA's contractor safety management program employs a system of controls which requires contractors to meet CUSA's standards and expectations for supporting safe facility operations to protect contractors, employees, the community and the environment. The Refinery requires that potential contract companies complete and return a pre-qualification questionnaire regarding their safety programs to Contracts Administration for review against established criteria. The questionnaire includes confirmation that the company has an established written safety program, job qualification employee requirements, a program for random drug and alcohol testing, initial and refresher training programs, a behavioral based safety process and a short service employee program. Metrics, such as Total Recordable Incident Rate, are also considered when selecting contract companies. Contracts Administration may also request that the contract owner submit additional documentation, such as safety training records/logs. The contractor office field audit process also includes verification of appropriate skills and certification required to perform the job.

This class has been upgraded by the State of California, SB54 and an addendum AB55 to 3 classes with a total of 20 hours of training: Refinery Safety Orientation (8 hours), Craft Specific (8 hours) and Principles of Refining (4 hours). In addition, each contractor employee must complete a course in Incident and Injury Free Indoctrination (IIFI), emergency procedures and Refinery-wide work practices specific to the Chevron Richmond Refinery. Training is also given on process-specific hazards related to the area in which the contractor employee will be working. These classes are conducted by OSCA and HASC and consist of Safe Work Practices 1 & 2 (SWP1, SWP2).
