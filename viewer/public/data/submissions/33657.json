Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. (MarkWest) - Kenova facility located in Kenova, West Virginia is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Cabell/Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses natural gas liquid (Y-Grade) extraction.  Y-Grade is the one substance present at the facility that is regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  This flammable substance is a mixture comprised of propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes).\n\n\n\nThe facility Y-Grade is extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline.  Once extracted, the Y-grade is stored in a 42,000-gallon capacity pressure vessel (D-5).  The Y-Grade is then transferred via pipeline to a fractionation facility.\n\n\n\nThe total quantity of product stored in the 42,000-gallon capacity vessel D-5 is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessel is not filled above 90% of full capacity.  Additionally, pressure relief devices provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filled to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressuriza"

      "SummaryText": "tion which could cause structural damage to the vessels and lead to a release.\n\n\n\nBased on the administrative controls described above, the maximum inventory present in D-5 and at the facility would be equal to 90% of the total 42,000-gallon capacity: 37,800 gallons (the equivalent of 171,519 pounds) of Y-Grade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analysis for this MarkWest facility were based on the requirements set forth in the RMP rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e), Worst-case release scenario-flammables and 40 CFR 68.28, Alternative release scenario analysis.  The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the RMP regulations.  The NGL extraction and storage processes at MarkWest are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program in place at the MarkWest Kenova facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nMarkWest maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nMarkWest conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes at the facility are identified and controlled efficiently.  The HAZOP methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at MarkWest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at MarkWest to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the specifics of the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as "
