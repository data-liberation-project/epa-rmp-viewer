      "SummaryText": "Cloverleaf of Napoleon owns and operates a refrigerated warehouse facility at 1165 Independence Drive in Napoleon Ohio. This facility houses two seperate ammonia refrigeration systems both containing over 10,000 pounds of ammonia. Construction of the second system ( Process  # 2 ) was completed in the Spring of 1999.  The new engine room contains 5 compressors ranging in size from 150-horse power through to 250-horse power. This engine room also contains all of the ammonia holding vessels except for one vessel, which is located outside of the building structure.  The other process ( Process  # 1 ) has its own  engine room containing 6 compressors ranging in size from 40-horse power through 200-horse power. This engine room contains all of  this systems large ammonia holding vessels, some small surge drums, containing ammonia are located within the freezers in the older portion of this facility.\n\nThe systems comprise of various refrigeration components including compressors, evaporators, vessels, pumps and condensers. These ammonia refrigeration systems are operated with a variety of safety devices employed within them, included are high and low pressure automated shutdown systems and high level automated shutdown systems.  Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the systems before shutdowns occur.  Equipment operating parameters are monitored throughout the day and logged for comparison to indicate potential problems.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia at this facility within the last five years.\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to evacuate the facility and allow the local Fire Department to intervene and bring the situation under control.   This plan has been discussed with the local Fire Department.  Cloverleaf is in the process of upgrading their emergency response to a higher level of participation and plans to have training and procedures in place before the year 2001.            \n\nWo"

This vessel normally contains a maximum 1,900 pounds of ammonia but if the makeup valve stuck open it could contain 3,200 pounds of ammonia before the high-level system shutdown would occur. The EPA requires that calculations of the worst-case scenario be based on a 10-minute time interval for the vessel to completely empty its contents. The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario of 3,200 pounds of ammonia being released over a 10-minute time frame would be a .7-mile radius around the facility.\n\nAlternate-Scenario. (Process  # 1) - The scenario chosen for the alternate scenario is one of a pipe being broken clear through and to have a wide-open, undeformed, open end.  The pipe size is a 3/4-inch schedule 80 type, with an operating pressure of 57psig.  The release rate from a pipe fracture of this type would be 860 pounds per minute.  Calculations for release time duration of 2 through 30 minutes showed the toxic end point to be no greater than a .2 mile radius around the facility.\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. (Process  # 2) - Failure of the largest storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 14,000 pounds of ammonia.  This vessel normally contains a maximum 5,900 pounds of ammonia but if the makeup valve stuck open it could contain 14,000 pounds of ammonia before the high-level system shutdown would occur.
