PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\r\n\r\nPSC management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the RMP manual.  \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nRifle Gas Plant is a 50 mmscf/day natural gas dewatering and liquid hydrocarbon extraction facility that is jointly owned constructed by PSC and Source Gas;  the plant is operated by PSC.  The RMP-regulated substances handled at this facility are flammable mixtures and propane.  The flammable mixtures are extracted from the natural gas processed at the plant;  propane is used for refrigeration.  There are four 30,000 gallon liquid hydrocarbon product storage tanks (607,200 pounds) and one 1000 gallon propane tank (5060 pounds).\r\n\r\nThe gas processing section and the liquid hydrocarbon storage between the ESD on the inlet of the gas plant (SV 155) and the ESD on the outlet of the gas plant (SV 153) are currently the only portions of the Rifle Gas Plant regulated under the RMP regulation.

The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\r\n\r\nProcess hazard analysis are conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.
