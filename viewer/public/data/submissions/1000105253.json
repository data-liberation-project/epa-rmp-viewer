Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Dresick Cooling has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Dresick Cooling, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Dresick Cooling has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical              | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nAmmonia Refrigeration        Anhydrous Ammonia               33,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n2. Organize"

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following: \n\n(5) Rooms\n(1) Cherry Hydrocooler\n\nFacility Location\n\nDresick Cooling is located at 19935 W Jayne Ave, Huron, CA 93234. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.137189, -120.155184. The facility is located approximately 830 feet east of interstate 5 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is not located in a special flood hazard area.\n\nDresick Cooling is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that faults within close proximity are not considered high risk:\nGreat Valley thrust fault system - <150 Years\nSan Andreas fault zone - <150 Years\nSan Juan fault zone - <15,000 Years\n\nThe USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Dresick Cooling had a 2-5% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\nDescription of Covered Process\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\nThe refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\n\nMachinery Room\n(6) Screw compressors\n(6) Oil separators\n(6)"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nDresick Cooling has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of th"

The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 33,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nDresick Cooling has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nDresick Cooling's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDresick Cooling has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Dresick Cooling's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented. Dresick Cooling has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Dresick Cooling has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Dresick Cooling now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Dresick Cooling employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Dresick Cooling will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
