The Water Treatment Plant presents the risk of a chlorine release. We have coordinated with our local emergency departments on emergency response and public notification procedures. The Water Treatment Plant has installed a chlorine scrubber automated valves that automatically activate in case chlorine gas is detected by monitors in the chlorine building. All chlorination equipment and chlorine piping are checked on a routine schedule.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe Chillicothe Municipal Utilities Water Treatment Plant\r\nhas taken several safety measures to prevent a chlorine gas\r\nrelease. The water treatment plant has installed a new\r\nchlorine scrubber that will activate if chlorine gas\r\nis detected. It will also shut down the regulators\r\nin the Chlorine building. All chlorine equipment\r\nis checked on a routine basis and serviced accordingly to\r\nmanufactures recommendations. Chillicothe Municipal\r\nUtilities is committed to provide a safe environment for the\r\nresidents of the City of Chillicothe. All water plant\r\npersonnel will be trained in chemical awareness and safe\r\nhandling of chemicals. The water treatment plant will\r\ncontinue to upgrade safety equipment as it becomes available\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILLICOTHE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY AND THE REGULATED\r\nSUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Chillicothe Municipal Utilities Water Treatment Plant is\r\na 4.5 million gallon per day water supply for the city of\r\nChillicothe, MO. The source of water supply is alluvial\r\nwells. This water is of good quality but is highly\r\nmineralized. The treatment process uses calcium oxide (lime)\r\nfor removal of much of these minerals, commonly known as\r\nsoftening. Sodium Aluminate is added as a softening aid and\r\nfor clarification. Carbon dioxide gas is available when\r\nneeded to make the water non corrosive as it is deliver"

Chlorine gas is a regulated substance and\r\nthe water treatment plant has on site 6,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nChillicothe's worst case scenario is a release of 2,000\r\npounds in 10 minutes.This release would have offsite impact. \r\nThe offsite impact would include, schools, major industry,\r\nprison, recreation areas and residences. The model plan used\r\nto determine the distance is the (EPA'S RMP*COMP)(TM)\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nChillicothe's alternative release scenario is a release of\r\n900 pounds in 30 minutes.This release would have offsite impact.                                                       \r\nThe offsite impact would be major industry.

The water\r\ntreatment plant has installed safety equipment that will help\r\nreduce the possibility of a chlorine release.
