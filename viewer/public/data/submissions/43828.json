      "SummaryText": "1.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nKIK Custom Products (KIK), formerly CCL Custom Manufacturing, Inc., operates a warehouse in Danville, Illinois which is subject to U.S. EPA regulations governing Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (RMP) under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68).  This Risk Management Plan has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR part 68, Subpart G.  The Risk Management Plan certifies that KIK has instituted a Risk Management Program at the Danville, Illinois warehouse that is in compliance with U.S. EPA RMP requirements.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan follows the format provided by the RMP Data Elements published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, including comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs, the Risk Management Plan establishes that the warehouse\u00bfs worst-case release and five-year accidental release history qualifies the warehouse for Program Level 1 status under the RMP regulation.  This signifies that the KIK Danville warehouse does not pose an off-site hazard to the public.\n\nKIK initially submitted a Risk Management Plan in June 1999.  Under 40 CFR 68 Risk Management Plans must be updated at least once every five years.  KIK has updated the plan in accordance with EPA guidance and has made minor changes to the process hazards analysis.  However, no conclusions have changed.  This document presents the updated Risk Management Plan for KIK\u00bfs Danville Warehouse.\n\n1.1  Corporate Statement\n\nKIK Custom Products recognizes and believes in the importance of safeguarding both our natural resources and our environmental heritage.  As such, we are committed to our customers, employees, and the various communities in which we operate to protect the health of our environment through the development and maintenance of programs which:\n\n- Comply with federal"

The Danville facility has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the Risk Management Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The management system identifies the following job functions by responsibility level:\n\nKIK Facility Management:  Vice President General Manager\nRisk Management Program Development and Implementation:  Divisional Environmental Compliance Manager\nAccident Prevention/Process Safety Management Program:  Site Safety Supervisor\nOff-site Hazards Assessment:  Divisional Environmental Compliance Manager\nEmergency Response:  Site Safety Supervisor\n\n2.0  PROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR 68\n\nThe EPA Risk Management regulation identifies three levels of requi"

      "SummaryText": "rements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a \u00bfsignificant\u00bf release of a regulated substance over the previous five years and for which the worst-case release does not affect \u00bfpublic receptors\u00bf (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facilities, hospitals).  Because the KIK warehouse meets these criteria, it qualifies for Program Level 1 status according to 40 CFR 68.  RMP Program 1 requires a review of the five-year accident history and evaluation of a worst-case release to verify that public receptors would not be affected, and procedures to notify off-site emergency response agencies (e.g., fire department) of the on-site hazards associated with the regulated substance.\n\nKIK operates a warehouse at warehouse at 714 West Ross Lane in Danville, Illinois that can store up to seven million aerosol cans.  These aerosol cans contain various amounts of flammable hydrocarbon propellants to provide the pressure to force the product from the container.  Combinations of up to five regulated flammable chemicals are used as propellants and, therefore, may be present in quantities exceeding the 10,000-lb threshold for flammable substances established by the regulation.  The regulated substances include isobutane, n-butane, propane, 1,1-diflurorethane, and dimethyl ether (DME).  With an average amount of 40 grams of propellant per can, the total amount of propellant stored in the warehouse is estimated to be up to 630,000 pounds.\n \n3.0  ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThere are no specific accidental release prevention program requirements for Program 1 processes under 40 CFR 68.  KIK operates its warehouse in a manner that promotes safety and has systems in place such as fire/smoke detectors and sprinkler systems to enable rapid emergency response and mitigate the effects of accidental releases of flammable materials should they occur.\n\nKIK relies on the Westville Area Fire Department to control emergen"
