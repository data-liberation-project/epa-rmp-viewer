      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nKCPL - Hawthorn Generating Facility, Kansas City, MO 64106\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nThe Kansas City Power & Light (KCPL) Hawthorn Generating Station maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities. The listed RMP rule threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds. KCPL will store the chemical in an 8,000 gallon (41,000 pounds) tank for Unit #9 and a 30,000 gallon (130,000 pounds) tank for Unit #5. The storage and management of anhydrous ammonia for both systems is addressed in this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the Hawthorn Generating Station as an air pollution control additive, to reduce the nitrogen oxide (Nox) emissions to the atmosphere from Unit #5 and Unit #9 boilers. Each boiler unit is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device. \n\n\n\nPlant Description\n\n\n\nThe Hawthorn Generating Station is located in Jackson County, Missouri, at 8700 East Front Street, Kansas City. The facility is situated east of Interstate I-435 on the south bank of the Missouri River, west of the confluence of the Missouri and Blue Rivers. The property south and west of the Hawthorn Generating Station is urban and occupied by other industrial entities. The strip of property directly across the Missouri River from the Hawthorn Generating Station is generally not developed and wooded. \n\n\n\nAmmonia System Description\n\n\n\nEach of the ammonia storage tanks is designed to be filled by a tanker truck at a dedicated loading station. The tanks will be maintained at a pressure of 60 to 100 pounds per square inch (psi), by drawing liquid ammonia from the bottom of each, heating it in one of two electric vaporizers and routing the ammonia vapor back to the tank head space. For the NOx control systems, ammonia vapors will be drawn from the tanks, regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the boiler flues within each respective ammonia injection grid.

      "SummaryText": "nation with the catalyst in the selective catalytic reduction unit, nitrogen oxides will be reacted and emissions of the pollutant will be reduced. The lower explosive limit (LEL) of the ammonia air mixture is measured at the ammonia vapor air mixing point and the system is designed to trip off at 20% of the LEL of ammonia in air.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario for ammonia was calculated as the loss of the larger 30,000-gallon tank in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance for RMP development. The ammonia would be released as a gas. As required by the rule, only administrative control systems such as the company policy to fill the tanks to a maximum of 85% liquid by volume, were taken into consideration. The conditions of the scenario, such as release time and weather status are those specified in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance. The area of potential impact was determined using RMP*Comp modeling software developed by the EPA. \n\n\n\nThe results of the Off-Site Consequence Analysis indicated that the ammonia would travel approximately 4.4 miles under the specified weather conditions before dispersing in the atmosphere to the specified toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14 mg/l. Within this radius from the ammonia tanks, an estimated 93,000 persons could potentially be affected. Maps of the area and a list of the types of receptors in the potential impact area are provided in the Off-Site Impact Analysis Section of the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nThis type of rapid release would occur only if the ammonia tanks were breached. The likelihood of such an incident occurring is miniscule, anhydrous ammonia tanks are installed with multiple safety systems to prevent the release of an entire tank in a single event. \n\n\n\nAlso, in the event of a release, it is highly unlikely that the ammonia would disperse in a circular pattern given the weather conditions in Kansas City.

      "SummaryText": "ing a release, it is expected that an ammonia plume would disperse in the direction of the prevailing wind at the time of the event, as opposed to covering the entire area defined by a circle with a radius of 4.4 miles. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more likely release scenario than the worst case. Engineered controls, such as automatic shut-off valves, check valves, relief valves and water misting system can be considered in the analysis.\n\n\n\nThe type of system failure identified for the alternative release was a loss of ammonia caused by a major leak in the liquid piping network between the tank and vaporizers. As a conservative estimate, the rate of release was assumed to be the maximum flow that would not cause the ammonia storage tank liquid excess flow valves to automatically shut. The leak was assumed to continue until the ammonia odor would alert an operator or plant security personnel. The main isolation valve would be closed manually if it is safe to do so. If the ammonia vapor concentration is unsafe for facility response, the Kansas City Fire Department will be called to respond to the emergency. The estimated worst case time of leak detection and complete response for the Fire Department in the alternate release scenario is 60 minutes. \n\n\n\nThe results of the Off-Site Consequence Analysis using RMP*Comp, indicated that the ammonia would travel approximately 0.2 miles under the specified weather conditions before dispersing to the toxic end point concentration. Within that radius of the ammonia tank storage area, the only receptors include plant personnel and employees of the adjoining industrial facilities. Maps of the area and a list of the types of receptors in the potential impact area are provided in the Off-Site Impact Analysis Section of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment (PHA)\n\n\n\nProcess hazard assessments were performed using a Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP"

During the PHAs, each system was methodically assessed/evaluated. Points in the system where ammonia could potentially be released were identified.  Valves that are relied upon to respond to an ammonia release were identified as shown on the system engineering diagrams. Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nPrevention System\n\n\n\nThe Hawthorn Generating Station does have operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system. There will be Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel will receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia systems is visually inspected once per shift on a 24-hour per day basis. Plant security personnel inspect the areas in which the ammonia tanks are located on an hourly basis.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of both ammonia storage systems are in place. The SOPs are posted in appropriate areas. Personnel are trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures. \n\n\n\nThe larger ammonia tank at Unit #5 is equipped with a water sprinkler system on the exterior of the tank to cool the tank and piping. Both tanks are located outdoors which will better ventilate the areas.  A tempered water shower is located at the filling station of the Unit #5 ammonia tank.  \n\n\n\nThe Unit #5 and #9 ammonia tanks and piping systems are inspected monthly by an outside contractor for leaks.  The contractor inspects all safety systems and relief valves to insure that they are within their certification dates.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nPlant personnel are trained to respond to leaks that can be managed by shutting off key emergency valves.
