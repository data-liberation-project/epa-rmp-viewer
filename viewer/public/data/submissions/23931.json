The DDNV also serves as the main supply point for a portion of the Navy that supports NATO as well as humanitarian relief efforts in the United States, the Caribbean, and other countries. The DDNV Refrigerated Warehouse in building CEP-156 is a cold storage facility located in the southwest portion of the Sewell's Point Area of the Naval Base Norfolk.  The facility is located directly south of Cold Storage Road, and access to the facility is provided through Second Street, which is south of Admiral Taussig Boulevard.  Building CEP-156 is a single-story building, approximately 231,800 square feet, used as a cold storage plant for all foods requiring chilling or freezing.  The building contains three cells - one chiller cell and one freezer cell constructed in 1975, and one freezer cell constructed in 1995.  CEP-156 uses ammonia to provide the refrigeration and this substance is the only regulated substance at the installation.\n\n\nThe release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for ammonia models the EPA recommended parameters of a 10-minute release of all material in a single container to the air.  No passive mitigation is assumed.  This scenario assumes that the Control Pressure Receiver ruptures.  The alternative-release scenario for ammonia would involve failure of a flange or pipe on the high-pressure side of the system.  The pipe diameters for the Control Pressure Receiver, the Pilot Receiver, and the Auxilary Receiver are 1 ?\" in diameter.  This would give a leak rate of 2,460 pounds per minute.  The DDNV ammonia refrigeration facility includes an extensive ammonia sensor bank, computer control for rapid shut-downs, and a 24 hour/day 7 day/week watchstander to monitor the process for operating parameters and for leak detection.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps."

This program mirrors an existing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation called \"Process Safety Management\" (PSM).  The ammonia located at building CEP-156 is already subject to the OSHA PSM requirements.  The Section 112(r) Prevention Program is a twelve-element matrix of requirements that, collectively, reduces the potential for having an accident.  The program requires that formal safety procedures be prepared and documented.
