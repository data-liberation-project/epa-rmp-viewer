Policy for the Department is defined by NAVFAC Publication P1021, \"Navy Shore Establishment Fire Protection/Prevention Program,\" OPNAV Instruction 11320.23 (establishes policy, standards, guidance and responsibilities for installation fire protection and emergency services), and OPNAV Instruction 5090.1 (establishes regional Naval On-Scene Commanders and Navy Facility Incident Commanders). \n\nThese regulations were designed to meet the following objectives: \n                                         \n1) To save lives.\n2) To minimize and avoid injuries. \n3) To protect the environment.\n4) To minimize property damage. \n  \nThe Emergency Response Procedures provides the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation.

It also interfaces with direct vendor-to-customer and local delivery services including the packing and storage of new and repaired aircraft parts as well as the handling and shipping of radioactive and medical items.

      "SummaryText": "jority of the workload comes from supplying the Navy's Atlantic and Mediterranean fleets, Atlantic bases and numerous shore establishments.  The DDNV also serves as the main supply point for a portion of the Navy that supports NATO as well as humanitarian relief efforts in the United States, the Caribbean, and other countries. The DDNV Refrigerated Warehouse in building CEP-156 is a cold storage facility located in the southwest portion of the Sewell's Point Area of the Naval Base Norfolk.  The facility is located directly south of Cold Storage Road, and access to the facility is provided through Second Street, which is south of Admiral Taussig Boulevard.  Building CEP-156 is a single-story building, approximately 231,800 square feet, used as a cold storage plant for all foods requiring chilling or freezing.  The building contains three cells - one chiller cell and one freezer cell constructed in 1975, and one freezer cell constructed in 1995.  CEP-156 uses ammonia to provide the refrigeration and this substance is the only regulated substance at the installation.\n\n\nThe release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for ammonia models the EPA recommended parameters of a 10-minute release of all material in a single container to the air.  No passive mitigation is assumed.  This scenario assumes that the Control Pressure Receiver ruptures.  The alternative-release scenario for ammonia would involve failure of a flange or pipe on the high-pressure side of the system.  The pipe diameters for the Control Pressure Receiver, the Pilot Receiver, and the Auxilary Receiver are 1 ?\" in diameter.  This would give a leak rate of 2,460 pounds per minute.  The DDNV ammonia refrigeration facility includes an extensive ammonia sensor bank, computer control for rapid shut-downs, and a 24 hour/day 7 day/week watchstander to monitor the process for operating parameters and for leak detection.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps."

      "SummaryText": "\nThe ammonia Prevention Program will requires the greatest amount of resourcing.  This program mirrors an existing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation called \"Process Safety Management\" (PSM).  The ammonia located at building CEP-156 is already subject to the OSHA PSM requirements.  The Section 112(r) Prevention Program is a twelve-element matrix of requirements that, collectively, reduces the potential for having an accident.  The program requires that formal safety procedures be prepared and documented. Formal management of the prevention program and the facility is performed via the DDNV ammonia refrigeration contractor, currently Webb Technology, Inc.  Webb Technology, Inc.  specializes in ammonia facilities and provides technical and operational expertise.\n\nFive-year accident history. \nWithin the past five years, the ammonia refrigeration process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program.  \n\nThe emergency response program.  \nIn the event of fire, explosion, release of a regulated substance or other emergency, NSNV maintains 114 full time fire fighters with a minimum of 41 people per shift.  The Fire Department has 22 personnel that are HAZMAT-trained. The Naval Station Norfolk Fire Department is a comprehensive community and emergency response service system.  The Fire Department has a total of 114 fire fighters with a minimum of 42 people per shift (There are two shifts.). There are four segments of the Fire Department that are individually assigned responsibility for areas of the post.  Emergency response personnel participate in major regulations (such as the RM) with other directorates/divisions that require emergency service planning.
