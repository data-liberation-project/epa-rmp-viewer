      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThe Jamaica Water Pollution Control Plant is one of the 14 facilities operated by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) which treats the City's wastewater. Each of these facilities produces methane as a byproduct of anaerobic digestion of sewage prior to discharge of the treated effluent into waterways (and dewatering of biosolids [sewage sludge] for beneficial use.) This processing of wastewater is an essential step in preventing the pollution of New York City's surface waters. Digester gas is used in the facility to provide domestic and treatment process heat.\n\nThe methane in the digester gas is a regulated flammable substance under both the EPA and OSHA regulations.  At Jamaica the maximum inventory of digester gas exceeds the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nNew York City DEP is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \n\nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through the Fire Department of New York.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe NYCDEP has conducted an offsite consequence analysis as required by the regulations, including an extremely unlikely, worst-case release scenario (i.e., total release from the single largest container over a ten minute period, assuming worst case meteorological conditions followed by an explosion of the resulting vapor cloud).   Results of this worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors would be affected. \n\nA release represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the robust design of digester vessels and gas holders (they are designed to withstand pressures well in excess"

A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in The alternative release scenario(s) section below.\n\n Alternative Release Scenario\n\nA credible worst-case scenario, formulated in accordance with USEPA guidance, was selected as the Jamaica alternative release scenario. This scenario involves a ten-minute release of the contents of a vessel followed by a vapor cloud fire. Results of this credible worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors could be affected.  \n\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nNYCDEP is committed to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Plant Chief has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The Plant Chief has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nTo ensure that a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the NYC DEP maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving methane.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\n\nFlammable gas detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n\nProcess safety information to document the safe p"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major methane release that could have had adverse effects on the public.  \n\nEmergency Response\n\nIn the event that a methane release does occur, the Jamaica facility has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the Fire Department of New York. If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the Fire Department of New York who would dispatch firefighters to the facility.\n\nMaintaining A Safe Operation\n\nThe NYCDEP continually works to safely manage the hazards of methane to protect employees and the community we serve.
