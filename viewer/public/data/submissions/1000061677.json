As part of this commitment, Firestone has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes of the Lake Charles Plant.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Program (the RMP rule) and OSHA's 29 CFR part 1910.119 (the PSM rule).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide interested parties with a description of the risk management program at the Plant.  \r\n\r\nFirestone is an active participant in the community.  The Lake Charles Plant is voluntarily involved in the Calcasieu Community Advisory Panel (CAP).  The purpose of this group is to share information about plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The Lake Charles Plant is also an active member of the Lake Area Industry/McNeese Engineering Partnership (LAI/MEP), the Safety Council of Southwest Louisiana, Mutual Aid of Southwest Louisiana, Calcasieu Area Emergency Response (CAER), and the Calcasieu Parish Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\nOver the past five years the Lake Charles Plant has received several corporate pollution prevention awards and Bridgestone/Firestone corporate safety awards for 15%, 30% and 35% improvements in safety performance.\r\n\r\nFirestone is committed to the safety of workers, the public and the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Lake Charles Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel are prepared to re"

The Plant produces a wide range of synthetic rubber products manufactured by the solution polymerization process.\r\nThree flammable substances and one toxic substance are covered under the Accidental Release Program (ARP).  The three flammable substances are 1,3-butadiene, 2-butene-cis, and 2-butene-trans.  The toxic substance is boron trifluoride.\r\n\r\nWORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO FLAMMABLE\r\n\r\nBoth the flammable worst-case and alternative release scenarios at the site involve 1,3-butadiene.  A worst-case release of 1,154,673 pounds of 1,3-butadiene from tank F-133 results in a distance to endpoint of 0.8 miles.  The alternative release scenario involves a release of 1,3-butadiene through  piping failure in the tank farm area. A 3/4 inch piping failure is assumed to have occurred and it is assumed that the flow would continue for ten (10) minutes in duration. A total of 3,840 pounds of 1,3-butadiene is determined to be released for the 10 minute duration before the release is isolated. The alternative release scenario results in a distance to endpoint of 0.08 miles.  The USEPA's RMP*Comp modeling software was used to determine the distance to endpoints for both flammable release scenarios.\r\n\r\nWORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO TOXIC\r\n\r\nBoth the toxic worst-case and alternative release scenarios at the site involve boron trifluoride.  A worst-case release of 30,000 pounds of boron trifluoride is determined to occur from 16 cylinders that are manifolded together on two truck trailers. The release results in an endpoint of 7.4 miles. The alternative release scenario involves a release from a single cylinder, which contains 1,875 pounds of boron trifluoride. The entire contents of the cylinder are assumed to be released over a ten minute span (release rate of 187.5 lbs./min.). The al"

The processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The Prevention Program questions found in section 7 of the Risk Management Plan Data Elements submittal have been answered assuming that they apply to OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nOpen communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  There are various levels of responsibility taken by different employees, including the facility manager, safety coordinator, department managers, first-line supervisors, and all employees.\r\n\r\nThe Plant actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\n\r\nThe Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and e"

Other chemical-specific information includes maximum intended inventories of chemicals, information on inadvertent chemical mixtures that could occur and their associated hazards. The Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment, which include information on materials of construction, piping/instrumentation diagrams, relief systems design, as well as others.  This information is provided to maintain safe operations at the facility.\r\n\r\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  PSI is updated through the Management of Change Program, as are the operating specifications.  The entire system is audited every three years.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Plant uses some or all of the hazard evaluation techniques outlined in the American Institute of Chemical Engineers publication Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures to perform these evaluations.   The analyses are conducted using a team with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.
