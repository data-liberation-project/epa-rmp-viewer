Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn this manufacturing facility, we handle chlorine, which is a toxic non-flammable substance. The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent excessive human exposures.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices introduced in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the trailing of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based, in part, upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Risk Management Program guidances.  The emergency response plan includes detailed procedures for mitigating releases, procedures for notification of the local fire, medical, and emergency response authorities, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nB.  The Stationary Source And Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture sodium hypochlorite (bleach) for customers. Chlorine is received by rail car. It is then used in the manufacturing of sodium hypochlorite.  This facility has equipment for safe unloading of the rail cars. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  The total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is limited to the reasonable minimum.\n\nC.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distance For Each Reported Scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario: In this scenario, it is assumed that the entire contents of a railcar are released as vapor, which is heavier than air.  The distance to the"

The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/L (3 ppm) is determined by the the model you use.  This has the potential to extend past the facility's boundary.\n\nD.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThis facility complies with U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute, and U.S. EPA regulations and guidelines.\n\nE.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\nNo accidental release of hazardous materials in reportable quantities has occurred during the past five (5) year period.\n\nF.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. We have discussed this program with the Dallas County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the City Fire Department. Representatives of the City Fire Department and many emergency responders have visited this plant.\n\nG.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility was constructed in 1952, and it has operated safely for over five (5) decades.  We continue to improve our programs to insure the maximum safety for our employees, workers of the nearby businesses, and residents of the surrounding areas.  The most notable improvements occurred as a result of an incident in 1997, when all safety procedures and systems were reassessed.  This facility now utilizes three levels of safeguards to protect against an accidental release: (1) perimeter/process area sensors with automatic shut-off of the process using chlorine, (2) automatic shut-down system which is activated by loss of pressure or electivity, a"

A closed manufacturing system was installed in 2005.  This improvement provides safety controls for the manufacturing system, and controls the process fugitive emissions and the potential of unauthorized excessive emissions from the processing system."
