Disinfection involves addition of chlorine and aqueous ammonia to the water to destroy bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that may cause harm to public health.  Other chemicals are handled and safely used onsite to aid filtering and removal of organics and other particulate materials that may affect the taste and odor of the treated water.  These chemicals are not part of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program, but are handled, stored, and used in a safe manner by Randall-Bold WTP staff.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine disinfection process at the Randall-Bold WTP is subject to two regulations A\u00bf the Federal Risk Management Plan and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), which is CaliforniaA\u00bfs version of the RMP.  The initial compliance deadline for both of these regulations was June 21, 1999.  As required by the regulations, an RMP was prepared for the Randall-Bold WTP and submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Contra Costa Health Services Department (CCHSD) at that time.\r\n   \r\nRMP/CalARP regulations require that the RMP be resubmitted every 5 years.  Based on the last RMP submission date of June 17, 2009, the 5-year RMP resubmission requirement must again be met by June 17, 2014.  The purpose of this RMP is to comply with the 5-year resubmission requirement.\r\n\r\nPrior to RMP/CalARP requirements, the Randall-Bold WTP implemented programs to comply with several other accidental release prevention regulations that predated RMP/CalARP.  These earlier regulations included CaliforniaA\u00bfs OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program and CaliforniaA\u00bfs Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) because of use and storage of chlorine. The California RMPP law was repealed"

To meet this goal, CCWD has identified potential hazards, implemented comprehensive accident prevention programs, installed safety and release response equipment (including a scrubber system to treat release events and other process and piping related safety equipment), and prepared for emergencies. The CCWDA\u00bfs approach to meet safety information and associated operating and maintenance procedures and documentation requirements for RMP/CalARP is to build upon the existing programs and regulatory compliance activities associated with the PSM and RMPP Programs. The PSM and RMPP were implemented at Randall-Bold WTP when regulations became effective at the facility.  Most of the compliance requirements, documentation, procedures, and safety programs to meet compliance with these new regulations were taken directly from PSM and RMPP documents or existing operating and maintenance procedures. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this RMP is specific to the chlorine process at Randall-Bold WTP.  Randall-Bold WTP aqueous ammonia is below the Federal RMP threshold concentration limit of 20 percent by weight.  However, there is no aqueous ammonia threshold concentration limit for the State of California.  As such, all aqueous ammonia use in California exceeds the StateA\u00bfs threshold concentration limit and may be subject to RMP requirements depending on storage amount.  Aqueous ammonia use at Randall-Bold WTP is presented in an addendum RMP under agreement with CCCHSD.

The Randall-Bold WTP uses chlorine to disinfect water so that it is safe for customers to drink. Chlorine disinfection is a common process at water treatment plants. The Randall-Bold WTP disinfection system uses liquefied chlorine gas from four 1-ton containers. Up to twelve more 1-ton containers are kept in the chlorine storage room. A vacuum is used to draw chlorine out of the containers and into the water supply.  \r\n\r\nThe chlorine storage and use areas are all inside a building that is designed to vent to a scrubber in the event of a chlorine release. The scrubber system can remove up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas released inside the building.

Chemicals such as alum, ozone, and polymers are added to aid in the filtering and removal of organics and other particulate matter that may affect the taste and odor of the potable water. Chlorine and aqueous ammonia are the only CalARP regulated substances in use at Randall-Bold WTP.\r\n\r\nB.2\tDescription of the Process\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia, at 19% concentration by weight, is stored in a 6,000 gallons capacity abovegr"

This slope and drainage serve to collect and contain liquid spills from the tank.\r\n\r\nFor operational purposes, the storage volume never exceeds 5,400 gallons of aqueous ammonia.  The tank is equipped with various devices to relieve vacuum and prevent over pressurization, and control emissions during bulk loading and operation.  These devices include a pressure vacuum relief valve, vapor scrubber, and vapor return line.  In the event of excess pressure, ammonia vapors from the tank vent through the pressure relief valve to the vapor scrubber.  During bulk loading, vapors are returned to the delivery tanker truck by way of a vapor return line.\r\n\r\nThe primary use and purpose of aqueous ammonia is to form chloramines to maintain chlorine residual.  Chloramines prevent the formation of trihalomethanes in the treated water distribution system.  To form these chloramines, the chemical feed room pumps draw aqueous ammonia from the bulk storage tank.  From the chemical feed room, aqueous ammonia is piped to one or both of two injectors.  The primary injector feeds the aqueous ammonia at a point in the water treatment process located before the post ozone contactor.  The aqueous ammonia mixes ultimately with a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is added after the post ozone contactor, to convert the free chlorine residual to combined chlorine residual (i.e., chloramines). \r\n\r\n\r\nC.\tWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nCalARP requires an offsite consequence analysis of a worst-case scenario (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS).

RMP*CompTM is readily available to the public through EPA.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the results of the offsite consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nC.1\tWorst-Case Scenario\r\n\r\nUnder the guidelines, a WCS considers a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the single largest container over a ten-minute period.  Given these parameters, the single largest container at Randall-Bold WTP is the aqueous ammonia storage tank.  The tank has a maximum capacity of 6,000 gallons.  By CCWD administrative procedure the tank volume never exceeds 5,400 gallons.\r\n\r\nFor the Randall-Bold WTP WCS, the model input used passive mitigation.  This mitigation consisted of the containment of a spill in both the chemical storage area (area) and spill containment basin (basin).  For modeling purposes it was assumed that both the area and basin flooded simultaneously.  The depth of the modeled basin was set at the maximum height of the basin.  These are extremely conservative assumptions as they present the maximum amount of spill surface area exposure.\r\n\r\nThe model input also consisted of conservative input (e.g., rural conditions, stability class F, and wind speed of 1.5 meters per second) in accordance with the guidelines.  Additionally, an aqueous ammonia concentration of 20 percent was used to estimate distance to toxic end point.  This concentration is a set value in RMP*CompTM.  It slightly overestimates the actual concentration to yield conservative results.\r\n\r\nGiven the aqueous ammonia toxic endpoint (TE) of 0.14 milligrams per liter (CalARP Section 2770.5), the WCS distance to TE is 0.5 miles.
