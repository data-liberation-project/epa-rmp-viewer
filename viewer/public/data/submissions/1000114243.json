Employees involved in operating  the AF Line ammonia system must receive training that includes applicable operating procedures and an overview of the process. Training must emphasize safety and health hazards, and safe work practices.\n\nWeyerhaeuser NR MDF facility employees have received initial training on the operations of the regulated processes, an overview of each of the RMP/PSM plan elements, and the procedures that must be followed to comply with the requirements of the RMP/PSM plan. In addition to RMP/PSM plan training, Weyerhaeuser NR MDF facility's employees have been trained in the emergency action plan . Refresher process operation training must be provided at least every 3 years. \n\nContractors\n\nWeyerhaeuser NR MDF facility must make contractors aware of the known hazards of the AF Line ammonia system process related to the contractors' work. In addition, the facility must make contractors aware of the applicable elements of its emergency action plan. Weyerhaeuser NR screens contractors for those who can perform work on or adjacent to the ammonia system process without compromising the safety and health of employees at the facility.\n\nBefore allowing a contractor to work on or adjacent to the ammonia system process, Weyerhaeuser NR must obtain and evaluate information regarding the contractor's safety performance and programs. When a contract involving work on or adjacent to the ammonia system is to be bid, the bidding procedures must ensure that contractor safety management requirements are met. If a contractor is to work in or adjacent to any covered processes, a safety briefing, to make the contractor aware of the Weyerhaeuser NR MDF facility's RMP/PSM plan requirements, must be conducted before work begins.

No new or significantly modified process will start up and no acutely hazardous chemicals will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review. The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that the facility is ready to operate new and modified regulated processes safely.\n\nTo initiate the pre-startup safety review, all updated elements of the Process Safety Management Plan are assembled for review. This includes all process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training and mechanical integrity. A pre-startup safety review team completes a pre-startup checklist. The pre-startup safety review team should complete and sign a Pre-Startup Safety Review Form. This form documents the process and helps ensure that the review has been properly performed. The Pre-Startup Safety Review Form must be authorized before startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nAn effective mechanical integrity program is one of the primary lines of defense against a release. The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle ammonia is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\n\nMDF facility maintenance employees use a computerized maintenance management system to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, schedule preventative maintenance (PM), provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory"

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Columbia Falls facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe Weyerhaeuser NR Columbia Falls, Montana complex consists of a log yard and a medium density fiberboard (MDF) facility.\n\nIn the MDF process, sawdust and planer shavings are refined into fine cellulose fibers. These fibers are then mixed with urea formaldehyde resin and dried to the proper moisture content. The dried fibers are then formed into a mat and pressed into MDF panels. These panels are sanded, cut to final size, and packaged for shipment.\n\nIn the MDF process ammonia is added to the MDF panels where the ammonia reacts with the free formaldehyde to bind the formaldehyde to prevent future formaldehyde off gassing. Liquid ammonia is transferred from the ammonia storage tank through a pump to a vaporizer. In the vaporizer the ammonia is converted from a liquid to a gas. From the vaporizer the gaseous ammonia goes through a filter and flow control instrumentation to the vacuum treatment chamber where the ammonia is pulled through the MDF panels and reacts with the forma"

Any residual, unreacted ammonia then goes through a baghouse filter to a vacuum pump, then is discharged to the atmosphere through a vent stack.\n\nThe Weyerhaeuser NR AF Line ammonia system is subjected to the RMP requirements because ammonia is stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold. Because the facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, the facility's ammonia system process is subject to the most stringent of three RMP programs (Program 3).\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe Prevention Program, together with the Emergency Response Program, makes up the RMP/PSM Plan. The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. These 12 elements are summarized below.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nWeyerhaeuser NR supports and encourages employee participation in its safety program. Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the employees and it allows the employee's experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan. Employees are involved in the facility's incident investigation of near misses, as well as accident investigations, safety meetings, developing and/or revising operating procedures, and employees participating in the Process Hazard Analysis that is described below. MDF facility employees and contractors receive hazard awareness training that instructs them on how hazards may impact their jobs and are trained on the emergency action plan. Those employees who operate and maintain the AF Line ammonia system are trained in how to safely maintain and operate these processes.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe RMP regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, their hazards, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of a RMP p"

The information is supplied to contractors who work in the MDF facility AF Line ammonia system area as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. This information is being used by Weyerhaeuser NR staff to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHA that was performed for the MDF facility AF Line ammonia system. \n\nThe MDF facility AF Line ammonia system PHA was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of Weyerhaeuser NR employees familiar with the process operation and maintenance, and plant management. The PHA was done using a combination of What-If and Checklist methods. Based on the results of the PHA, the facility will review the recommendations and address them in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures for the MDF facility AF Line ammonia system have been developed as part of the RMP/PSM. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing employees. The detailed operating procedures include startup, shutdown and emergency operating procedures. The procedures describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release.

In addition to preventative maintenance, the MDF AF Line maintenance employees perform corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. The employees that carry out maintenance are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM.\n\nHot Works Permits\n\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the AF Line ammonia system. To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot work is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torches, welding equipment, grinders, cutting, brazing, or similar flame- or spark-producing operations. The process of completing the hot work permit makes it necessary to identify the hazard, recognize what safeguards are appropriate, and then initiate the safeguards necessary to ensure a fire-safe workplace. Following the standards outline in this section aid in complying with the OSHA Hot Works Regulations (1910.252(a)).\n\nManagement of Change\n\nA system for the proper management of changes and modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions is required under the RMP/PSM.

A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and to implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, an investigation team will be established. As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared, and changes recommended as appropriate.\n\nThe investigation team should ask questions such as what equipment failed, which behavior failed, and which material leaked, reacted, or exploded. As part of the incident review, employee's actions that may have contributed to the incident will also be reviewed. A determination will be made as to whether it is necessary to institute additional training for the employees to prevent the incident from occurring in the future. On the incident investigation report form, the MDF Plant Manager identifies which of the recommended system changes are approved for implementation. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all employees who operate and maintain the AF Line ammonia system.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nThe MDF facility is required to complete a compliance audit for the RMP/PSM program. The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to gather sufficient data to verify compliance with RMP/PSM requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase safety awareness among plant employees.\n\n A compliance audit must be conducted at the plant at least once every 3"
