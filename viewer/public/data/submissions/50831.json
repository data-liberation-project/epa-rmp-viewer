The building is equipped with temperature controls and make-up vents.  The building is operated under negative pressure created by the vent scrubber.  There are two (2) modes of vent operations:  normal and emergency.  In the event of a chlorine release, the vent system doubles the air turnover through the building.  \n\nRedundant system.\n\nEquipment Design\n\nThe chlorine piping system is constructed of Hastelloy metal tubing.  This tubing is both compatible with chlorine (non-corrosive) and rated to 1,500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine is only 150 psig allowing for a 10 to 1 safety margin.  There is a chlorine monitor that detects the presence of chlorine in the storage building.  The monitor, along with the other plant detection systems, will alarm to alert employees of a potential chlorine release.\n\n\n\n5.0 \tFive-Year Accident History (40 CFR 68.155(e))\n\nPer 40 CFR 67.42(s), no accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the Corning \u00c2\u00bf Concord site over the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n\n6.0 \tEmergency Response Program (40 CFR 68.155(f))\n\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the facility\u00c2\u00bfs Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).

Corning \u00c2\u00bf Concord\u00c2\u00bfs prevention program complies with all applicable U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program regulations codified under 40 CFR 68.\n\nManagement System\n\nConcord \u00c2\u00bf Corning maintains a management system to oversee the implementation of and compliance with all elements of the RMP regulations.  This management system, along with other Corning \u00c2\u00bf Concord policies, provides a means to eliminate and/or reduce the potential for hazardous chemical releases at the plant.\n\nPrevention Program Level 3\n\nCorning \u00c2\u00bf Concord is a Program 3 facility.  Therefore, Corning \u00c2\u00bf Concord\u00c2\u00bfs prevention program provides for policies, procedures, and systems that address all elements of the RMP concerning Program Level 3 facilities and implementation procedures.  Corning \u00c2\u00bf Concord\u00c2\u00bfs prevention program also addresses the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00c2\u00bfs (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program elements, which are similar to those required by the RMP regulations.

The site is located at 14556 Highway 601 South, Midland, Cabarrus County, North Carolina.  The Corning \u00c2\u00bf Concord plant currently employs 150 full-time employees engaged in the manufacture of fiber optics.  \n\n\nRegulated Substance\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance at the plant that exceeds the threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68; therefore, chlorine is the only substance at the plant for which the RMP regulations apply.  The chlorine storage and distribution system is contained in a specially designed process building.  All chlorine utilized at the facility is contained with the Bulk Chlorine Storage Building that is equipped with vent make-up and exhaust scrubber systems.  The chlorine process was installed as part of the fiber optic manufacturing process.  Chlorine is received, stored and utilized in two (2) processes that distribute chlorine to four (4) control panels.\n\nChlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2 and serves as a chlorinating or oxidizing agent.  Chlorine is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and OSHA listed toxic chemical, an irritant, and a corrosive substance.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen or a flammable substance.  OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for chlorine is 1 ppm.  The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) lists chlorine with a health rating of 4 (severe) with immediate and delayed health hazards.  \n\n\n\n\n3.0 \tREMOVED - Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios (40 CFR 68.155\u00c2\u00a9)  \n\n\n\n\n4.0 \tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThroughout the facility"
