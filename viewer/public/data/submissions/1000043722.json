This commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in accident prevention programs, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release should occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond, control and contain the release, and notify outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Midkiff Gas Plant is located four miles East of Midkiff, Texas on Farm to Market Road 2401 (about forty miles South-Southeast of Midland, Texas) and includes compression, amine gas treating, dehydration, and two cryogenic plants for the low temperature recovery of natural gas liquids (NGL's). The plants produce a lean, dry residue gas stream (primarily methane), a mixed natural gas liquid stream (NGL) and a natural gasoline/condensate stream. The liquid products contain ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes. The plant uses an amine process to remove carbon dioxide and traces of hydrogen sulfide. This facility does not handle threshold quantities of any regulated toxic substance, therefore, there are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Midkiff Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) for the Midkiff Gas Plant involves the following equipment:\n\n- Gasoline Storage Tank 450 (mixture of flammable gases)\n\nThis storage tank was selected due to having the greatest inventory and"

The WCS for this Program Level 1 facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing a flammable NGL mixture. Although controls and procedures are in place to limit the storage inventory of this tank, the WCS calculation is based on 100% of the tank capacity (5,147 barrels) being released and ignited, resulting in a VCE with a maximum distance of 0.77 mile, or 4,064 feet to the 1 psi endpoint, utilizing the TNT-equivalency method. Although controls and procedures are in place to prevent such a release from occurring, no credit was taken for active or passive mitigation measures in evaluating or calculating the WCS for the Midkiff Gas Plant.\n\nSeveral Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for regulated flammable substances were calculated involving regulated flammable substances at the Midkiff Gas Plant. Although an ARS is not required of this Program Level 1 facility, the following was selected as a credible scenario for emergency response and planning purposes:  - Pipeline Pump P-603/P-604 seal failure.\n\nThis ARS was evaluated and calculated with the failure of a seal, which could release 45,600 gallons of flammable NGL mixture over a period of sixty minutes. The maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for this hypothetical scenario would be 0.48 miles or 2,511 feet. Although the Midkiff Gas Plant is a Program Level 1 facility, this ARS was calculated for informational purposes only.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process and employee safety issues. These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change, safe work practices, our \"Safe Start\" program and participation in flow sheet reviews.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Midkiff Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Midkiff Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate. The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Midkiff Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations, if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n- Hydrocarbon area detectors and flame detectors both with alarms.\n\nRelease Containment /Control\n\n- Process relief valves that discharge to a flare which will capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n- Valves to permit isolation of portions of, or the entire process.\n\n- Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters.\n\n- Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\n- Redundant equipment, backup systems and instrumentation (e.g. UPS system).\n\n- Atmospheric pressure relief devices.\n\n- Overall plant and local area ESD's.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n- Manually operated fire extinguishing systems.\n\n- Trained emergency response personnel.\n\n- Personnel protective equipment (e.g. self-contained breathing equipment).\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the last five years there have not been any hydrocarbon releases at the Midkiff Gas Plant whose quantities approached those described in the RMP release events.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORM"

      "SummaryText": "ATION\n\nThe Midkiff Gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety and the environment. The program consists of procedure for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion, should a flammable substance accidently be released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup. In addition the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program of the Midkiff Gas Plant is coordinated with the Big Lake fire department and local emergency planning committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Midkiff gas plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergency situations. The Midkiff gas plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve local emergency response organizations. In addition, the gas plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n"
