This starts with delivery of aqua ammonia solution in DOT approved tank-trailers and then transferring the product into a 12,971 gallon, carbon steel storage container.  Unloading of the product from the trailer to the storage tank is conducted in a containment area that is designed to catch any accidental spills.  The storage tank are located in a containment basin and is equipped with high level indicators to help prevent accidental overflow.  Prevention continues by having employees trained in proper handling procedures and using unloading checklists.  Employees are also equipped with proper personnel protective equipment to safely store raw materials and manufacture and package additives for customer delivery.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.  We also follow industry standards, such as those of the National Association of Chemical Distributors to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community.",
