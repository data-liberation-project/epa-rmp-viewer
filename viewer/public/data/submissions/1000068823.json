We believe that excellent performance in the areas of health, environment, safety and security goes hand-in-hand with operational excellence and financial success. In fulfilling this commitment, we will comply with regulatory requirements and provide and maintain a safe working environment using acceptable and proven business practices. All Kinder Morgan employees will strive to identify and eliminate hazards which could result in injury and illness, damage to the environment, property damage, and security losses.\r\n\r\nThe KMCC Galena Park Splitter is operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which we operate. We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning.  This summary provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed and implemented.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe KMCC Galena Park Splitter is a condensate processing facility located in Galena Park, Texas.  The KMCC Galena Park Splitter receives condensate via pipeline and processes it into product streams including LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas, in this case, Y-grade, a flammable mixture regulated under Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan Regulations), Naphtha, Kerosene, Diesel fuel and Fuel oil.  The KMCC Galena Park Splitter complies with Process Safety Regulations in the covered process areas including all LPG loading/ unloading areas, LPG storage vessels, pumps and associated pipin"

LPG is stored in two (2) 20,000 barrel spheres and can be delivered offsite via either pipeline or the truck loading rack.\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment. The release modeling included in the Risk Management Program assumes a more conservative approach by modeling the composition of the flammable mixture to consist of all butane. This would predict a release impacting the largest area. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, and the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard 29CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention programs are in place at the KMCC Galena Park Splitter:\r\n1) Employee Participation\r\n2) Process Safety Information\r\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) \r\n4) Operating Procedures\r\n5) Training\r\n6) Contractor Safety\r\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review\r\n8) Mechanical Integrity \r\n9) Hot Work \r\n10) Management of Change\r\n11) Incident Investigation\r\n12) Emergency Planning and Response\r\n13) Compliance Audits\r\n14) Trade Secrets\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe facility has never had an accident involving the covered process which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe KMCC Galena Park Splitter maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations.  The programs are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required.  Our Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Contained within the Plan are written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the facility.  These emergencies may include: airborne releases of c"
