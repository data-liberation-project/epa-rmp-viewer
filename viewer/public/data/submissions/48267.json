The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  Refining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2, which are on contiguous properties.  BWC also has delayed coking operations in Area 3 (EPA Facility ID 1000 0014 9662), which is not adjacent to Areas 1 and 2.  A separate RMP submittal has been prepared for that area.\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific \"regulated substances\", or hazardous chemicals idenfied by the EPA, that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  BWC has various \"regulated substances\" in quantities above the threshold amounts.  \n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at BWC\nSection 3: Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\nSection 4: BWC Accidental Release Prevention Program\nSection 5: Five-Year Accidental Release Summary\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSection 1:  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\n\nEquipment at the various units is designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable internal engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.

Regular expansion and improvements of facilities have occurred over the years by different owners, including the integration of an adjacent refinery in 1986 that doubled gasoline production.  In 1998, the refinery became a part of Equilon Enterprises, LLC, a joint venture of Shell Oil Company and Texaco Inc.  Shell Oil Products US acquired Texaco's interest in 2002.  On March 16, 2005, Big West of California, LLC acquired full interest in the refinery.\n\nBWC refines crude oil into a number of consumer products, including gasoline, diesel, gas oils, liquified petroleum gases (LPG), ammonia (for local agricultural use), and coke.\n\nTable 1 lists the covered process units that are subject to the federal Risk Management Program, defines the appropriate RMP program level, and identifies the regulated substances handled in these units.\n\n\nTable 1\nSummary of Covered Process Units - BWC Areas 1 and 2\n\nCrude Vacuum Unit \n(Units 10, 11, and 12) \nPhysically separates crude oil into intermediate and final products by boiling the crude oil and condensing the vapors (i.e., distillation).\nFederal RMP Program Level: Level 3\nRegulated Toxic Substances: None\nRegulated Flammable Substances: Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, Isopentane, Pentane\n\nHydrogen Generation Unit (Unit 20) Manufactures high purity hydrogen for consumption in the hydrotreaters, and the hydro"

The endpoint for toxic substances is a specified concentration, and a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion is used for flammable substances.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a regulated toxic is one where the total quantity in the largest vessel or pipe is released for ten (10) minutes, resulting in acute health effects associated with airborne exposure.  For a regulated flammable substance, the worst-case scenario is one where the total quantity of the regulated flammable substance in the largest vessel or pipe is assumed to vaporize and instantaneously result in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nA summary of the worst-case scenarios for BWC Areas 1 and 2 is provided below.  As required by the RMP rule, the results are shown for one vessel containing a toxic substance (ammonia) and one vessel containing a flammable substance (flammable liquid).  These scenarios produced the greatest distance to their respective toxic and flammable endpoints.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Results - BWC Areas 1 and 2\n\nRegulated Substance: Ammonia, Anhydrous (toxic gas)\nArea/Unit: Area 2 Tank Farm\nAdministrative Controls Considered: Quantity stored limited to 80% of capacity by written operating procedures\nPassive Mitigation Considered: None\nOff-Site Impacts: Yes\n\nRegulated Substance: Flammable Liquid\nArea/Unit: Area 2 Tank Farm\nAdministrative Controls Considered: Quantity stored limited to 87% of capacity by written operating procedures \nPassive Mitigation Considered: None\nOff-Site Impacts: Yes\n\n3.2  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nIn addition to worst-case scenarios, this RMP contains a second set of release scenarios designated as alternative release scenarios (ARS).  These scenarios are more realistic than worst-case scenarios for assessing the potential hazards posed by process units and developing emergency response plans.  Although these scenarios may be unlikely to occur, they are physically possible and reasonably feasible. "

Process Safety Information (PSI), which addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, limits for specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information, was compiled for each process unit.\n\nPSI is used in process unit hazard analyses, inspection, maintenance, and training activities.  This information is kept current by management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures, which are discussed further in this section.\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazards Analysis\n\nBWC conducts process hazards analyses (PHAs) to ensure that hazards associated with process units are identified and controlled.  Under this program, each process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.

A walk through was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company.  The objective of the seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of a regulated substance having off-site consequence would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computerized tracking system.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nBWC has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.  The written operating procedures address the various modes of process operations such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.\n\nThese procedures are used as references by experienced operators and for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process and through annual certification.\n\n4.4  Training\n\nBWC's general policy requires operating personnel to be trained in the safe operation of facilities, handling process upsets, emergency response, and personal safety.

The requirements for Management of Change are documented in a written procedure, and MOC-related information is kept for the life of the process unit.\n\n4.6  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe purpose of the Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides additional assurance that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR also verifies that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nPre-startup reviews are goverened by a written Pre-Startup Safety Review procedure and covers a variety of issues, including:\n\n   * construction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications;\n   * safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate;\n   * for new facilities, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented   \n     before start-up;\n   * modified facilities have complied with MOC requirements including updating the process safety information (e.g., piping \n     instrument diagrams, operating procedures, etc.); \n   * training of each applicable operating employee and maintenance worker has been completed.\n\n4.7  Mechanical Integrity\n\nBWC has estab"

BWC maintains a certification record that each inspection and test has been performed, which includes the date of the inspection, the name of the inspector and test, and the serial number or other identifier of the equipment.  Every recommendation made by an inspector is resolved and documented.  In so doing, BWC will correct deficiencies in equipment that are outside acceptable limits (as defined by the process safety information) before further use, or in a safe and timely manner that ensures safe operation.\n\n4.8  Compliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, BWC shall conduct audits every three years to assure that the accident prevention program is being implemented.  These audits shall include an assessment of written prevention program elements, retained records (e.g., training records, completed hot work permits, etc.), and personnel interviews to assess the level of implementation for the prevention program.  SBR also implemented this audit schedule when they were the owner of this facility.\n\nCompliance reviews are performed by trained, expert personnel.  Audit results are communicated to affected employees and contractors, and retained for five years.  Action items or recommendation resulting from the various audits are tracked to completion through a computerized database.\n\n4.9  Incident Investigation\n\nThe BWC accident investigation program covers four types of incidents:\n\n   * personal injury;\n   * environmental release; \n   * equipment damage and loss of production caused by fire, equipment failure or other circumstance; and\n   * those incidents that could have reasonably resulted in a catastro"
