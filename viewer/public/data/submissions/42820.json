The facility's operation involves the manufacturing of feed stock products for the urethane plastics industry. This includes the manufacturing and packaging of various custom feed stocks leaving the plant in 5 to 55-gallon containers. The manufacturing process utilizes raw chemicals primarily consisting of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, formaldehyde, allyl alcohol and dimethylamine.  Raw materials for the process are received via tank truck and rail car.  Packaging materials are received by dray truck. Liquid raw materials are stored in tanks on the plant property both inside and outside. Packaged raw materials are stored on pallets in pallet racks until they are required in the manufacturing process. The products are manufactured in a batch process in reaction vessels of various sizes.  Finished products are stored in the tanks within the warehouse or in the vessels until they are packaged. \n\nThe finished products are packaged in a variety of styles and they are stored in the warehouse on pallet racks until shipped to the various customers. Finished products are also loaded into bulk trucks and delivered to customers.\n\nThe Pelron plant currently operates in compliance with Illinois State Air Permit.  The Pelron Plant is also subject to Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) Tier II filing for toxic chemicals. \n\nThe five chemicals stored at the Pelron Plant in quantities over the threshold values are Ethylene Oxide, Propylene Oxide, Formaldehyde, Allyl Alcohol and Dimethylamine.  They are brought in as raw materials and are essential in the production of various products. These materials are received in bulk either via rail car or tanker truck. Each is added at various times during the process at various temperatures and pressures."
