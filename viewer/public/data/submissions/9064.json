The company was purchased on 4-9-99 by Western Slidell, LLC. This facility was Tycon Gas Products from 8-27-97 to 4-9-99. Before 8-27-97 BOC Airco owned and operated this facility and still owns the property and buildings today. \n\nWestern is committed to the personal, property and environmental safety to all surrounding life and environment that could possibly be affected in any manner by the business conducted at this facility. Monthly safety meetings are held.\n\nWestern has active membership in CGA-Compressed Gas Association, NWSA-National Welding Supply Association, NFPA- National Fire Protection Association and the local LEPC.  Many of our management serve on the teams of these different organizations.\n\nWestern has a full-time Safety & Compliance Director that is OSHA certified and maintains an ongoing training program both outside of and within Western.  This enables Western to be on top of the most current regulations as they are issued.  Western has monthly safety meetings.  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility:\nWe take pride in having done it right the first time before an accident or incident would require any form of additional safety measures.  This facility has 3 gas monitors throughout the production areas.  The monitors are set at a level of gas detection that will alert us of any escaping gas at the point of weighing in the cylinders and again before they go out.  There is a shutdown switch to stop generation of Acetylene in the event of an incident.\n\nOur policy is SAFETY FIRST.  The personal safety of each employee of this company is of primary importance.\n\n\nOur facility and the regulated substances handled:\nWesterns primary business includes the manufacture of Acetylene Gas.  We have a dual generation system and transfer acetylene from chemical acetylene trailers into DOT regulated cyli"

      "SummaryText": "nders.  Acetylene is primarily used for welding applications across America.  It has no long term adverse health or environmental effects.  The process of manufacturing acetylene gas forms no hazardous wastes.\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\nWe used the RMP comp as guidance for both scenarios.  Both our worst case and alternative release scenario's endpoints are within one tenth of a mile of the plant. To put this in perspective, a 300 gallon propane tank which is in the back yard of many rural residences, will have an endpoint of about one tenth of a mile according to the same conservative calculations. \nFor both our worst case and alternative scenario's no administrative controls or passive mitigation measures limit the quantity released below the maximum capacity of the largest vessel or release rate of alternative case scenario.\n  \n \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe training of our personnel is a very important step in the accidental release prevention program and we take this very seriously.  The entire acetylene process from start to finish is specifically covered under the Process Safety Management (PSM rule) in CFR 29,1910.119 and is constructed and maintained under the regulations in NFPA51-A.  Our entire facility is also covered under the OSHA regulations.  \n\n\nThe five-year accident history:\nThere has not been an accident at this facility in the last five years.    \n\n\nThe emergency response program:\nCoordination of Emergency Response for this facility consists of communication with the Slidell Fire Department and Local EMS system. Training on emergency response is received by all personnel.  Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually or whenever a change in process occurs.  Monthly safety meetings are held.  Alert systems within the facility consist of an audible horn and by word of mouth.  There are currently five employees at this facility.   \n\n\nPl"
