      "SummaryText": " 2 inch storage tank transfer line that releases 5,000 pounds of anhydrous dimethylamine (DMA).  Potential public receptors include Village of Mapleton residents, Crompton Corporation employees, degussa Corporation employees, and the general public and commerce within the affected radius.  Assuming the released DMA results in a vapor cloud explosion, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.08 miles according to EPA's RMP* Comp (TM) model. (Note: MMA(50%) and MMA(anhydrous) produced the same results).\n\nWe are using this alternate case release scenario information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nalgroup lonza complies with OSHA's PSM rule and EPA's RMP rule.  We also participate in CMA's Responsible Care program.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n  -Process Safety Information\n  -Process Hazard Analysis\n  -Training\n  -Mechanical Integrity\n  -Management of Change\n  -Pre-Startup Reviews\n  -Compliance Audits\n  -Incident Investigation\n  -Employee Participation\n  -Hot Work Permits\n  -Contractor Safety\n  -Site Security\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program all work together to assist our efforts to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our facility management and our employees are committed to safe work procedures defined by the prevention program.  We have specific accountablitlies and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past five (5) years, we have not experienced an accidental chemical release from covered processes that has"

      "SummaryText": " resulted in either deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known deaths, injuries, evacuation, shelterings-in-place, property damage or environmental damage off site.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nOur emergency response program covered various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  We have procedures and we have conducted training for initial incident response, emergency responder contact, regulatory agency and community notifications, maintenance of emergency response equipment, and specific response management.  Futhermore, we actively participate in our Peoria County LEPC, coordinating our plan with the LEPC's community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have a trained emergency response team on site, and if necessary we coordinate with Timber Hollis Fire Department for handling larger emergency incidents.  Our emergency response team has incident command, fire, rescue, and Hazmat training and has conducted joint training and drills with the Peoria County LEPC and neighboring industries.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nLonza subscribes to the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care initiative, which provides for continuous improvements in all aspects of our safety, health and environmental programs.  In addition, plant safety programs include safety positives (improvement recommendations), behavior based safety activities, and celebrations of safety milestone achievements."
