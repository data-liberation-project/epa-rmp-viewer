The Facility Policy for Propane Storage at Brownstown\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Jackson-Jennings Co-op are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of LP Gas.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities. To mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\na The primary activity at the facility is the storage OF LP Gas for sale to farmers.\n\n\nb LP Gas is received, stored, and distributed for both consumer and farmer use.\n\n\nc The maximum quantity stored would be 68156 pounds in our largest storage tanks.  The largest of which is 18000 gallons.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 9000 gallons pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint point of detonation is .40 miles. \n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of detonation) is .10 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of NFPA 58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage and also the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.for general safety.\n\n\n\n \n5. The five-year Accident History \n\nOur Facility has not had any accidents that would have caused deaths, injuries, or significant properly damage at the facility; nor To our knowledge, have resulted in offside deaths, injuries, and ev"
