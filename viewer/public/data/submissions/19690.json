      "SummaryText": "The Citizens Utilitities Water Company of Pennsylvania Penn Water District Warehouse Facility stores up to 30  150 pound chlorine cylinders.  Emergency Response and Accidental Release Prevention policies have been instituted to include:  operation and maintenance procedures, training of employees, incident investigation, notification procedures in the event of a chlorine release, PPE for trained employees, on-site emergency response plans and procedures for notifying the local emergency planning committee in the event their response is necessary.\n\nThe facility has had no accidents resulting in on-site or off-site releases.\n\nTwo scenarios for off-site consequences have been completed.  The worst-case scenario describes the release of an entire 150 pound cylinder in an 10 minute time period or 15 pounds per minute.  Atmospheric conditions utilized for this scenario include a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability of F.  Under these conditions, the distance to Toxic Endpoint Limit was 0.8 miles.\n\nThe alternate-release scenario was based on a fire at the storage pad in which 20 cylinders would release chlorine gas.  A release rate of 300 pounds per minute was modeled, along with a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second and a stability class of D.  Off-site consequences were identical to the worst-case scenario.\n\nAn on-site Emergency Response Program and other safety information have been developed.  This program has been integrated with the Hazardous Materials Off-Site Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThis Risk Management Program will be updated as necessary based on changes in facility processes, if they occur.  The program will undergo review at least every five years if no changes occur."
