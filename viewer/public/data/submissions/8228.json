The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety dependa upon the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institure recommendations, as well as Federal, State and County guidelines.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and other regulatory agencies, who would in turn notify any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat water for potable use.  Chlorine is brought by truck in 1-ton containers.  4 cylinders are kept in the chlorine room.\n\nFailure fo a 1-ton container when filled to the greatest amount could release 2350 lbs of chlorine.   the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 3.4miles.\n\nBecause there are extensive safety features at the facility including vacuum regulators and automatic valves on the chlorine container heads, any loss of vacuum downstream would result immediately in shutting off the chlorine supply.  In such an event the maxkmum amount of chlorine release would be the amount in the 5/8\" tubing.  This amount is 3 pounds.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this alternative scenario is 0.1 miles.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Preventiion rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.  All of our employees have been thoroughly trained in the appropriate chlorine ahndling procedures.\n\nThere have been no chl"
