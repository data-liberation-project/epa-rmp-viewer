Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n     Policies\n\nThe Arkema Emulsion Systems Alsip Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Arkema Emulsion SystemsA? Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Arkema Emulsion Systems Alsip Plant is a manufacturing facility that produces synthetic latex polymer products, which are sold to customers that convert them into finished products such as latex paint, caulk and adhesives.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Alsip Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Arkema Emulsion Systems Alsip Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at levels above threshold quantities: \n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer (Acetic acid ethenyl ester)\nThe Alsip Plant has no RMP-regulated flammable substances.\n\n3. Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPAA?s RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of"

Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, are shown immediately after the scenario description.  The plant's general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\n\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nVinyl Acetate:  This scenario assumes a storage tank ruptures, releasing within 10 minutes 310,800 pounds of vinyl acetate as a liquid to the monomer mound storage dike, which in turn drains to the spill containment basin.  According to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\n\nSpecific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n\n  Fire Water Monitors:  Area fire water spray monitors can be used with foam to help suppress Vinyl Acetate vapors.\n\nA? Inhibitor:  The vinyl acetate contains an inhibitor that prevents reactions from occurring in a storage tank car that could lead to over pressure.\n\nA? Secondary Containment:  The tank is located in a concrete secondary containment structure and is connected to the spill containment basin.  This containment basin reduces evaporation from the spill.\n\n  The vapor monitoring system in the monomer storage area has been expanded to include the spill containment basin.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\nVinyl Acetate:  This scenario assumes the bottom valve on the tank car is knocked off and the entire contents, 195,000 pounds is lost in 10 minutes.  According to the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. The following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n\nA? Secondary Containment:  The railcar is located in a concrete secondary containment structure and is connected to the spill containment basin.  This containment basin reduces evaporation from the spill.\n\nA? Emergency Shutdown System:  There is a c"

Additionally there is a manual pump Start/Stop switch located in the control shed that can be turned to the off position and the unloading pump and transfer value will shut as their fail safe position.  This system can also be shut down remotely using the Moore APACs control system.\n\nA? Surveillance: Operations employees monitor the work area while the pump is in use.\n\nA? Rail Traffic Control:  To prevent possible collision and rupture of the rail car with rail equipment derailers are used to prevent unexpected moves and collisions.\n\n\nOther specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n\nA? Fire Water Monitors:  Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress vinyl acetate vapors in the process detention basin used in conjunction with inducted foam.\n\nA? Vapor Suppression:  Vapor-suppressing foam can be applied to the contents of the unloading pad using the foam water deluge system.\n\n  The vapor monitoring system in the monomer storage area has been expanded to include the spill basin.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nOur general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule and OSHA's PSM standard and implementation of Union Carbide's Operational Safety Program and Episodic Risk Management System.  Key elements include:\n\nEquipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazards, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Process hazard analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective acti"
