Most such disasters are caused by tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, fires, or explosions.  In   many cases, personal injury and loss of life have been greatly increased because of panic and confusion.  This company has implemented an emergency action plan that can reduce injuries and save lives if a catastrophe should occur.  Although, such plans seem remote in there use and implementation, it behooves Skylark Meats to be ready to respond in an organized manner, if such an occurrence should arise.  We believe in safety, protection of our employees, and the people that work and play in our community.\n\nB-Regulated Substances That We Use\n\nWe are in the meat processing, cold storage, and distribution business.   Being in the perishable food manufacturing business, we use and store quantities of anhydrous ammonia (35000 lbs.) in our refrigeration system.  Industry has used anhydrous ammonia for many years as a coolant because it is widely available, relatively cheap, and has exceptional ability to remove large quantities of heat.  Albeit, it does have it's dangers if stored and handled improperly.  That is why the Environmental Protection Agency has listed this chemical as an Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS).\n\n\nC-Accidental Release Preventive Program\n\nWe have adopted a program to meet the requirements of the Occupationaly Safety & Health Act's Process Safety Management standard.  This includes (1) training our employees.  We believe this is one of the most important steps that we can take to enchance employee safety.  An effective training program will help employees understand the nature and causes of problems arising from process operations, and will increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia refrigeration.  We believe in (2) employee involv"

We have developed complete and accurate (3) process safety information on ammonia.  This information is a valuable resource to a variety of users including the team that performs process hazard analysis, trainers, employees, and contractors.  We have developed isometric drawings of our ammonia system showing piping, instrumentation, diagrams, and all valve locations that are individually numbered and identified.  We have an ongoing program to review the safety records of our (4) contractors that perform work in and around processes that involve highly hazardous chemicals and others that are incidentally involved.  Their safety record directly impacts their work performance when on our premises.  We assure (5)  mechanical integrity so equipment used to process, store, or handle ammonia is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of release of ammonia.  We practice (6) management of change to technology, equipment, and procedures to assure that procedures have a technical basis for the proposed change, impact of change on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  We (7) investigate each incident that could result in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of ammonia.  We try to understand the mechanism that resulted in the release and make corrections immediately.  We insist on (8) non-routine work authorizations as required where work is performed using lockout/tagout, confined spaces, and hotworks.  We have our refrigeration maintenance personnel trained and knowledgeable of our (9) standard operating procedures.  Specific procedures have been written for initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, and emergency shutd"

We have conducted a (10) process hazard analysis to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards involved in our refrigeration system.  This analysis is based on such rationale as priority, extent of the process hazards, number of potentially affected employees, age of the process, and operating history of the process.  Every three years we have a (11) compliance audit to certify that the provisions of the process management standard are adequate and are being followed.\n\nD-Five Year Accident History\n\nWe have not had any accidents within the last 5 years.\n\nE-Emergency Response Plan\n\nWe have developed an emergency response plan in which we are co-ordinated with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee.  Our maintenance personnel have had 24 hour emergency response, confined space, hazardous communication, and lockout/tagout training.  Our maintenance personnel have been trained in the use of self containing breathing apparatus and such units are available in case of an emergency.  We conduct an annual emergency evacuation drill to familiarize employees with an orderly exit and the review of employee's responsibilities.  \n\nF-Planned Changes to Improve Safety  \n\nEmphasis will be put on increased awareness and employee training.  Equipment and system changes will be updated as the need arises"
