Description of the Flemington, NJ Facility\r\nThe Flemington, NJ facility is located at 55 River Rd. Flemington, NJ 08822. The facility provides\r\ntransportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of prepackaged\r\nspecialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as\r\nspecified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Flemington, NJ Warehouse include\r\nchemicals containing toxic hazards.

Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes\r\nRinchem receives Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous) & Hydrochloric Acid by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user.

Worst-Case Release Scenario\r\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential\r\nhazards at the Rinchem Flemington, NJ Warehouse. Rinchem conducted an offsite consequence analysis,\r\nusing the EPA's Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA),RMPcomp in conjunction with the rules\r\nspecified in 40 CFR 68.25 to estimate the offsite consequence of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) from our\r\nwarehousing process. The WCS associated with toxic substances in the Flemington, NJ warehouse is a\r\ncatastrophic failure of the single largest container resulting in a release of the total contents, 55 gallons of Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia anhydrous) & 55 gallons of Hydrochloric Acid (each shown separately). The passive mitigation measures taken into account for this scenario are the limited quantity of any of the two chemicals that can be released due to container and the handling of containers within the building.\r\n1.4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological\r\nsafeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those\r\nrecommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in Planned Changes to Improve\r\nSafety. The safeguards shown in Table A-1 include both administrative and technological safeguards that\r\nprevent, detect, or mitigate releases of chlorine.\r\n1.5.
