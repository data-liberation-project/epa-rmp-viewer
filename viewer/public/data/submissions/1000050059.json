Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nWe at the Grimmway Enterprises, Inc. Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental\r\nsafety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and\r\nour process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation,\r\noperation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our\r\nfacility. IT is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nOur facilitys primary activities encompass potato processing and storage. We have 1 regulated substance\r\npresent at our facility. The substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used as a refrigerant in our plant.\r\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 21,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls\r\nand mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\r\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the\r\nEPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and the RMP-COMP\r\ncalculation program.\r\n\r\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set\r\nout under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58\r\nStandard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention\r\nprogram that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nThe Grimmway/West Plan"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazop. The studies\r\nare undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and\r\nare revalidated at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nFor the purposes of safely conduction activities within our covered processes, the Grimmway/West Plant\r\nmaintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as\r\ninitial startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to \r\n\r\noperators\r\ninvolved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nThe Grimmway/West Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who\r\nare operating process equipment are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\r\nprocesses. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as necessary.\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\nThe Grimmway/West Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks of process equipment to\r\nensue proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among other: pressure\r\nvessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and\r\npumps. The timing of their inspections follow the recommended guidelines available form the manufacturer,\r\nthe International of Ammonia Refrigeration, and Chlorine Institute. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are\r\noffered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identifies by the maintenance checks are\r\ncorrected i"

These reviews are conducted to confirm\r\nthat construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to\r\nplacing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\nThe Grimmway/West Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out\r\nunder the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out least every three years and any\r\ncorrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nThe Grimmway/West Plant promptly investigated any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably\r\nresult in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the\r\nsituation leading into the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring.\r\nAll reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nThe Grimmway/West Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a\r\nteam effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident\r\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.
