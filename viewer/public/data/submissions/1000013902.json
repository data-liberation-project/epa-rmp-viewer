As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered process as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.

Glanbia is responsible for running the plant production, warehousing, and distribution, while SMP and DFA guarantee the milk requirements of the plant, which are approximately 10.5 million pounds milk per day.  The 300,000 square foot facility lies on a 3,000-acre site southwest of the town of Clovis, New Mexico.\n\nConsidered to be North America\u00c2\u00bfs largest cheddar cheese production plant, the facility produces blocks of cheese weighing up to 640 pounds.  Annual production reaches 280 million pounds of cheese and 18.5 million pounds of whey proteins using 2.7 billion pounds of milk.  The facility employs approximately 290 workers.\n\nProject design was provided by Power Engineers of Hailey, Idaho and E.A. Bonelli & Associates of Oakland, California.  Dahlgren Group of Seattle, Washington and the Carlisle Group from Minnesota constructed the plant.  Applied Process Cooling Corporation (APCCO) of Modesto, California designed and installed the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe Southwest Cheese Company plant is located at 1141 Curry Road 4 about six miles south of Clovis and Highways 60/84 and about two miles west of Highway 70.  The Clovis site was chosen for its proximity to a large, well-developed dairy producing region.

There are approximately 35,000 people living in Clovis, which was incorporated in 1909.  Prevailing winds are from the south and southeast.\n\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nThe single stage system has been designed with six (6) Vilter screw compressor packages and four (4) rooftop BAC evaporative condensers.  Screw compressor oil cooling is accomplished with a thermosiphon cooling recirculation arrangement using a thermosiphon receiver and liquid from the condenser drain line.\n\nHigh pressure liquid ammonia is drained from the evaporative condensers to the high-pressure receiver.  The receiver provides liquid to the recirculator vessel for direct cooling in the evaporator coils via the recirculator package ammonia pumps.  A liquid transfer vessel returns excess pumped liquid to the high-pressure receiver.  The recirculator package also provides liquid for glycol cooling via three (3) glycol heat exchangers.  A fourth heat exchanger utilizes liquid ammonia for polishing water cooling.\n\nThere is a single oil pot in the system at the recirculator.  The vessel is equipped with a self-closing spring-loaded drain valve for safety.  All pressure vessels in the system have dual safety relief valves (SRV's) to protect the respective vessel against overpressure conditions.  All SRV's relieve to atmosphere from a common discharge pipe on the roof.  An auto purger removes non-condensibles and air as required to maintain an efficient refrigeration process.\n\nEvaporator piping and valve trains are located on the roof, while the evaporators are located in rooftop penthouse units above the storage cooling and rapid cooling areas.  The evaporator coils are defrosted with hot gas from the high stage discharge line.\n\nA Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and compressor microprocessors provide system management and control.
