      "SummaryText": "he soil in which we grow many acres of vines that produce high quality grapes. The vines are tended and nurtured throughout the growing season by following up-to-date, progressive agricultural practices, which provide optimum development of the fruit. During the fall harvest season, the grapes are picked according to specific quality criteria and delivered to the winery to be processed into wine. Transported from the vineyard by trucks, grapes of many varieties arriving in 6-ton bins are separated into specific lots for crushing. The crushing process separates the thousands of gallons of juice from the skins, seeds and stems of the grapes to prepare the juice to become wine. This conversion process of juice to wine is called fermentation, and is accomplished with a microscopic organism called yeast. Wine lots of 3,000 to 350,000 gallons are then moved through various processes to clarify, consolidate, blend and finish into a product that is ready for our customers to consume. Many thousands of gallons of wine flow through miles of pipelines and numerous pieces of equipment and tanks of various shapes and sizes before reaching the final destination, the customer's glass.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Processes\n\nDuring our winemaking process there are many stages where refrigeration of the juice or wine is important to retain certain quality characteristics. Several systems installed around our facility to perform this task utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant chemical.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency lists anhydrous ammonia as an Extremely Hazardous Substance with a Threshold Planning Quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The process refrigeration equipment at Delicato Vineyards uses ammonia as the refrigerant gas.  There are eight ammonia refrigeration systems at this facility. The largest of these is actually comprised of two vessels linked to have a combined quantity of ~29,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe eight ammonia refrigeration systems are fixed i"

Each is dedicated to a particular processing application with locations throughout the winery.  There are two types of systems: a Tube In Shell and a Jacketed Tank.  The systems vary in size, with the ammonia quantity in each ranging from approximately two hundred gallons to three thousand eight hundred gallons.  The thermodynamic reaction cycles of ammonia expansion from a liquid to a gas, and compression of the gas back into a liquid all within a closed system, provides the necessary removal of heat from our wine and grape products. The period of heaviest refrigeration use is during the grape harvest season, usually from August through November.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia has been a commonly used refrigerant gas for decades because it is highly efficient. Ammonia is a naturally occurring compound, and some scholars believe the atmosphere of the earth was originally composed of ammonia (NH3) and water (H2O). Ammonia has also been extensively used as a primary fertilizer in our country's prosperous agriculture industry for many years through a process of direct injection into the soil. It is commonly used in many households as a cleaner for windows, floors and countertops. Treated with respect, ammonia provides tremendous benefit in the processes in which it is used to enhance our country's economy.\n\nBeing classified as a hazardous material, ammonia can be dangerous if it is mishandled. The concentrated liquid can freeze tissue and cause chemical burns. In a gaseous form of sufficient strength, it can be inhaled to cause immediate burning of lung tissue. This is why extensive safety precautions and equipment are in place at our facilities using anhydrous ammonia. Since our previous RMP submittal we have updated equipment drawings of each refrigeration package and increased the amount of labeling on each"

The company committed to this improvement to increase the level of awareness within the company\u00c2\u00bfs refrigeration technician population and to increase the standardization of the process. The company has also installed state-of-the-art control panels that allow for a user to monitor all safety and operating parameters in one location. The new control panels also allow remote access to trained technicians in the event the local panel becomes dangerous to approach. In the event of a release, an emitting refrigeration package could be isolated and shutdown remotely thus decreasing the response time and corrective action time in the event of a discharge. Structural barricades have also been erected around refrigeration packages that are susceptible to heavy internal traffic transporting grapes or grape processing material. The company has also improved the procedures of routine maintenance operation and the internal mechanical integrity program. All of these improvements were conceived from cross-functional review meetings designed to increase the quality of the company\u00c2\u00bfs RMP.\n\nInterestingly, ammonia-related deaths and injuries are more common from misuse of household ammonia used for cleaning purposes than from the millions of tons of anhydrous ammonia used around the world for industrial and agricultural processes.\n\nSulfur Dioxide Processes\n\nWine is a beverage that has been produced and consumed by mankind for thousands of years. While modern science and technology have greatly contributed to higher quality and increasing quantities, some basics of the winemaking still remain an art form. Almost equally paralleling the history of wine is the use of sulfur dioxide as a sterilizing and preservation agent. When first used, generation was from burning sticks of sulfur inside barrels and casks. Today there are safer and more efficient means to produce and use sulfur dioxide. In a compressed liquid form, this compound is more precis"

Operations and Maintenance personnel receive training through monthly safety meetings and periodic processing review sessions. A large group of employees from each department, which make up the Emergency Response Team participate in periodic emergency preparedness training throughout the year. Improvements in mechanical integrity are also providing a more thorough ability to repair or replace parts in the systems before they have a chance to fail. The company employs an outside party to routinely audit our safety programs to ensure our rate or improvement never stagnates. The company also sponsors an internal RMP/PSM cross-functional team with both of the company\u00c2\u00bfs wineries to update each other from lessons learned.

It has a long safe history of use in this form throughout the wine industry.\n\nAt our winery, sulfur dioxide is received from suppliers as a liquid compressed gas in one-ton cylinders. These cylinders are stoutly designed with thick steel walls that will remain intact even after receiving the impact of falling off a truck at highway speeds. Their successful historical use dates back into the early half of this century.\n\nFrom the one-ton cylinders, sulfur dioxide is dispensed in liquid form into portable canisters having various capacities of up to 100 pounds. Once filled, these canisters are transported around the winery and the liquid sulfur dioxide is dispensed into various wine tanks according to the winemakers written instructions. Specific amounts of sulfur dioxide are dispensed through a closed system into the selected wines. The amounts added are very small, in parts per million relative to the quantity of wine being treated. Due to the fact that we can have as much as 44.2 million gallons of wine on site, it is reasonable to calculate that we will use several tons of sulfur dioxide in our products through the year. The greatest period of use is during the harvest period of August through November.\n\nEven though sulfur dioxide is added to wine and becomes an integral part of the beverage we consume, there are still some hazards associated with the process of handling it. As a hazardous material, sulfur dioxide is more likely to cause harm as a gas, because it readily transitions a gaseous state at ambient temperatures. It can cause asphyxiating reactions if inhaled, due to lung tissue inflammation and damage. In its liquid form, this compressed gas also has the ability to freeze tissue it contacts, as well as causing chemical burns.\n\nThanks to safe design of the containers and the closed system in which it is used, sulfur dioxide releases are difficult to cause when correct procedures"
