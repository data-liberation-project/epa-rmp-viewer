The site's EHS Compliance Manager has been assigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and for ammonia refrigeration safety.  \n\n\n\nThe site occupies approximately 35 acres in an open, relatively flat, industrial area.  Within 500 feet of the west side of the facility is the I-75/I-71 combined interstate, and 500 feet on the other side of the interstate is residential area.\n\n\n\nThe Florence facility manufactures frozen pizza.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the two refrigeration systems that are contained within the the SGSC property boundary.  Ammonia is the most efficient and environmentally compatible refrigerant available.  Although it is toxic at high concentrations and is an irritating gas; it is not a cumulative metabolic poison, does not cause cancer or other dreadful diseases, and does not cause lasting environmental damage.\n\n\n\nSchwan's maintains 24/7 coverage at the site with emergency responders trained to the 24-hour HAZMAT first responders operation level at the facility with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule.  The training is designed with a heavy emphasis on ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, personal protective equipment up to use of Level 'A' Suits and interaction with an incident command system / national incident management system (ICS/NIMS).  Copies of emergency plans are filed with the Florence Fire Department, and annual facility walkthroughs are conducted with Florence Fire Officers.  A post-incident debriefing and investigation is conducted after each incident.  The Plant is fenced, security contractor is on-site 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.  The facility refrigeration team is on-duty 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.\n\n\n\nSince a continuous improvement philosophy is deeply imbedded in the Schwan's company culture, improvements in system safety are implemented as a result of em"
