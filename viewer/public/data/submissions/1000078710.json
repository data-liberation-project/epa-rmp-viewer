The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 2690 Highway 194 in Hart, Texas (the facility).  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There are two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility with capacities of approximately 30,000 gallons and 18,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.  A maximum total of 50 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia are stored at the facility at any given time.  The contents of the nurse tanks are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n  \r\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Manag"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\r\n \r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has been one qualifying accident involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan. An employee not wearing PPE was injured unbolting a pump that was believed to have been completely vented. While removing the last bolt, the employee was sprayed with anhydrous ammonia on the chin and right arm. Corrective actions included refresher training for all affected employees on PPE usage and specific job task instructions.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Hart Volunteer Fire Department (fire department) regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.

The Branch Manger is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a plan to address the suspect corrosion protection for the 18,000g PV\r\n2. Install 2 Continental PRVs in the Continental pressure relief manifold and 2 Squibb Taylor PRVs in the Squibb Taylor pressure relief manifold\r\n3. Modify the plumbing to meet the Standard at the liquid and vapor load-in and load-out stations\r\n4. Install EFVs between the transfer hose and Nurse Tank Riser to mitigate restrictions\r\n5. Install a pressure gauge on the discharge side of the liquid pump as recommended by the Standard\r\n6. In reference to accident: additional assessment and documentation of the incident to understand if the procedures implemented were valid or if there could have been something else done to have removed trapped pressure in pump\r\n7. Install HRVs between the discharge side of the liquid pump and nurse tank riser; and Internal Valves at the 18,000g PV and the load-in/load-oat station\r\n8. Identify PRVs and HRVs with missing rain caps\r\n9. Properly label the 18,000g PV before it is returned to service. \r\n\r\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety cu"
