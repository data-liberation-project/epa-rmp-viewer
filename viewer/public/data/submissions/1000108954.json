NIPG Lewisville policy is to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances. If a release occurs, as a non-responding facility, our employees are on hand to coordinate evacuation and communication with emergency responders. \n1.2\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a768.155(b))\nNIPG Lewisville uses a threshold quantity of 1,1-Difluoroethane (R152a) in its insulated metal panel operations as a blowing agent in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation. The maximum inventory of R152a expected to be present in this facility, based on process and operational requirements, is 76,602 pounds (rounded up to two significant digits for reporting purposes).\n1.3\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a768.155(c))\nThis facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations for chemical accident prevention and Risk Management Plans (RMPs). The R152a process is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Additionally, the facility is also subject to the EPA\u0092s Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place.\n1.3.1\tProcess Safety Information:\nNIPG Lewisville has compiled the relevant data as defined in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119(d). The data details electrical classification, materials of construction, safety systems, ventilation system design, and design codes and standards employed. The information contained within the Process Safety Information (PSI) is uti"

The organization utilized a Hazard Operability methodology, commonly referred to as a HazOp, to complete these necessary analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n1.3.3\tOperating Procedures:\nNIPG Lewisville maintains written operating procedures in accordance with the OSHA PSM standard. These procedures address the various modes of operation involved in the R152a process such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up post turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n1.3.4\tTraining:\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the job supervision and skills evaluation until they are deemed proficient to work independently. Refresher training on operating procedures is provided at least every three years, and more frequently as needed.\n\n1.3.5\tMechanical Integrity:\nNIPG Lewisville requires documented maintenance checks to be conducted on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined during these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and ventilation systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and"

Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n1.3.6\tManagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and processes. Process operators, maintenance personnel, and/or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations are promptly made aware of and given training appropriate to the modification.\n \n\n1.3.7\tPre-Startup Reviews:\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification of established processes are conducted as a standard practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n1.3.8\tCompliance Audits:\nNIPG Lewisville conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the chemical accident prevention provisions have been correctly implemented and maintained. These audits are carried out at least once every three (3) years, and any corrective actions identified during the audit process are completed in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n1.3.9\tIncident Investigation:\nIncidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance are promptly investigated and no later than 48 hours following the incident. These investigations are performed to identify the situation(s) leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions necessary to prevent recurrence. All incident reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(m)(7).\n\n1.3.10\tEmployee Participation:\nNIPG Lewisville encourages employees to express their views concerning accident prev"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. NIPG Lewisville has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n1.4\tFive-Year Accident History (\u00a768.155(d))\nNIPG Lewisville has not had any reportable, process related accidents or incidents during the past five (5) years.\n \n\n1.5\tEmergency Response Plan (\u00a768.155(e))\nNIPG is a non-responding facility. It has coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and nearby emergency responders. R152a is not required to be included in the community emergency response plan because it is not a regulated toxic substance. NIPG has also developed and implemented its own Emergency Action Plan for this facility. The Emergency Action Plan includes actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances as well as procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release. The last emergency response notification exercise was conducted on December 14, 2023. \n\n1.6\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (\u00a768.155(f))\nSome action items have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. NIPG will continue regular reviews of the R152a system and procedures. NIPG will also conduct annual notification and evacuation drills as required."
