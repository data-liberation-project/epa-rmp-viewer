      "SummaryText": "At this potable water treatment plant, we handle chlorine which is considered hazardous by the EPA. The use of chlorine as a disinfectant, inactivates numerous pathogens potentially present in raw drinking water supplies. The same properties that make chlorine an essential part of protecting the public from waterborne diseases make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine. These precautions  prevent unnecessary human exposure,  reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co workers and to reduce the threat of of nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chorine, the safety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our employees. Our emergency response plan is based upon the EPA's model for WWTP plants and the Chlorine institutes Pamphlet # 64 Respnse Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The Emergency Response Plan includes notification of ( 911 ) Mission Fire Department HAZ-MAT response protocol. The Mission Fire Department is the primary first responder to all chemical spills or releases in Mission,Texas. The primary purpose of this facility is to provide drinking water for the City of Mission,Texas. Chlorine is delivered from the vendor in DOT approved ton containers on a flat bed trailer equiped with a hydraulically operated unloading device. The inventory of chlorine stored at this facility is 10,000 pounds. The worst case release scenario of a one ton container would release 1900 pounds of chlorine . It is assumed that the contents will be released as a vapor that is heavier than air. The distance to the end point of .0087 mg/l ( 3ppm ) would extend a distance of 0.9 miles or less than a mile as determined by EPA RMP COMP model. An alternative release scenario of a hole in a gas delivery tube would release 105 pounds of c"

This facility complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations. The handling of chlorine in this facility is in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institues Chlorine Manual and pamphlet #'s 6,63,64,65,73,74,89,151,155and 162. We have not had any accidental releases or incidents in the last 5 years. This facility was constructed  in 1983 in accordance with the Standard Building Code Standards as well as desogn engineering for chemical applications. We will continue to improve our operations by incorporating new ideas and principles in reasonable safety and care."
