Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nAt our power plants, we handle isobutane, isopentane and pentane which are considered hazardous flammables by the US EPA. The same properties that make these regulated substances valuable as a working fluid for the power plants also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure,  to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our facility staff personnel, and to reduce the threat to our community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these regulated substances combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of these facilities combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\nSince our operators do not respond to large chemical releases, we have implemented an Emergency Action Plan which includes procedures for handling small releases of hazardous chemicals as required by OSHA under 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n2.  Facility and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe purpose of our operation is to generate electricity by utilizing the geothermal resource as a source of energy. Our facilities are located nine miles south of Reno, Nevada and includes eight power plants designated as SB1, SB1A, SB2, SB3, Galena 1, Galena 2, Galena 3, and Steamboat Hills. The SB1 and SB1A power plants are co-located at the northwest corner of the site and use the regulated substances pentane and isopentane, respectively, as the working fluids. The SB2 and SB3 power plants are located in the northwest corner of the site and both use the regulated substance isobutane as the working fluid. Galena 1 is located about 100 yards north of the SB1/SB1A system.  Galena 3 is located a half mile northwest of the SB2 and SB3 Facility. Galena 1 and Galena 3 are virtually identical to each other, the both utiliz"

Galena 2 and Steamboat hills are located 1.5 miles north of Galena 1, They both utilize pentane as their motive fluid.  \n\n- Geothermal Energy and Power Plants\nGeothermal energy is renewable heat energy from the earths core. Geothermal reservoirs of hot water or steam are tapped with wells and their heat is converted to electricity. At the Steamboat Power Plants, Galena 1, and Galena 3,  geothermal brine at a temperature of 300?-315? F is pumped from production wells drilled into the geothermal reservoir. The brine is kept under pressure to keep it from flashing to steam as it is piped through the plant to the heat exchangers where the heat is extracted from the brine and is used to heat a working fluid (isobutane, isopentane, or pentane) to a vapor. The used brine is injected back into the geothermal reservoir keeping the cycle closed. The vapor is piped through the blades of a turbine, spinning the turbine which is connected to a generator and produces electricity. The hot vapor is piped through air-cooled condensers, transforming it back to a fluid. The fluid is cycled back to the heat exchangers in a closed-loop system and the process starts again.\nGalena 2 runs much the same as the lower steamboat plants, but rather than keeping the brine under intense pressure to keep it a liquid, the geothermal fluid coming out of the ground is separated into steam and brine lines.  Galena has a preheater that is heated by hot brine, and a vaporizer that is heated by steam.  After the steam runs through the vaporizer, it condenses into water and then runs through a recuperator where it preheats the water going into the preheater.  The condensed is steam then mixed into the brine, and then pumped back into the ground at one of our injection wells.\n\nOur Steamboat hills facility or SBH has two turbines, one known as the STG, and the other known as OEC 41 or SBHE.  The STG is a steam flash turbine, and OEC 41 is a binary cycle that utilizes Pentan"

Collectively, SB1 and SB1A produce approximately 7 megawatts (gross) of electricity daily and sell the power to Sierra Pacific Power Company.\n\nSB1 uses approximately 85,000 pounds of pentane and SB1A uses approximately 25,000 pounds of isopentane within their closed-loop systems.\n\n-  SB2 & SB3 Overview\nThe SB2 and SB3 Power Plants were developed by Steamboat Development Corporation in 1992. In February 2004 Ormat Nevada, Inc assumed the operation of these two plants, while retaining the entire operations, maintenance and management staff. Collectively, SB2 and SB3 produce approximately 40 megawatts (gross) of electricity daily and sell the power to Sierra Pacific Power Company under a 30 year power purchase agreement.\n\nTogether, the plants use about 660,000pounds of isobutane as the working fluid within their closed-loop systems.\n\n-Galena 1 Overview\nThe Galena 1 facility was developed in 2005 by Ormat Inc.
