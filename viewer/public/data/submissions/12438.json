      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Alco Controls facility in Wytheville, Virginia, is committed to provide a safe work environment for its employees and protect the community from potential hazards associated with site operations.  Alco Controls senior management is dedicated to fulfill these goals and has established an environmental, safety, and health committee to address any concerns related to catestrophic releases in the workplace or to the environment.  The facility has active participation of employees and supervisors to address any concerns and implemented several environmental, safety, and health programs designed to prevent releases of toxic substances and prepare for the rare ocassion that a release may occur.\n\nRegulated Substance(s) Handled\n\nThe Alco Controls facility uses ammonia as a raw material, which is disassociated into nitrogen and hydrogen for combustion in a finishing furnace.  Ammonia can be toxic if inhaled in high concentrations and has a pungent, characteristic odor.  The maximum quantity of ammonia handled at the plant is 18,000 pounds.  The risk management plan (RMP) standard requires facilities with greater than 10,000 pounds of ammonia to prepare a plan and program to address potential releases.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP standard requires covered facilities to evaluate a worst-case and alternative release scenario.  At the Alco Controls faciltiy, the worst-case scenario would be the release of all of the ammonia storage tank contents (18,000 pounds) over a 10 minute period.  This release scenario is highly unlikely, since the tank is pressure tested annually and several failsafes (i.e., pressure relief valves) are provided to prevent such an ocurrance.  The alternative-release scenario would involve the failure of a pressure relief valve in the full-open position.  Assuming this event occurs, approximately 4,300 pounds of ammonia would be released in a 10 minute period.  Usin"

      "SummaryText": "g the RMP*Comp program to determine the toxic endpoint distance of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, it was determined that a release would reach offsite receptors.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Alco Controls facilty's ammonia disassociator system complies with applicable OSHA process safety management (PSM) provisions, which require the performance of a process hazard analysis (PHA), development of prevention and inspection programs, and employee training and participation.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Alco Controls facility has not had a reportable release of ammonia within the last 5 years.  No other operational activities have resulted in a release of significant quantities of ammonia in the workplace or offsite.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAlco Controls is regulated by several programs that require the development and implementation of spill prevention and countermeasures systems.  Facility personnel participate in periodic drills and inspect equipment that may experience leaks.  Any deficiencies are quickly addressed.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Alco Controls facility has recently updates its PSM progam with respect to the ammonia disassociator.  Recommnedations from the PSM Committee to be implemented to improve the safety of the system include the installation of additional safety valves, increased leak inspection, and updating existing response programs.  This work will improve the safety of this system which currently meets or exceeds industry-recognized standards."
