      "SummaryText": "Big \"N\" Fertilizer - Tulia, Texas\n\nOur facility has one 18,125 gallon tank, 2 8,000 gallon tanks, and equipment for receiving ammonia from truck transports and railcars and transferring ammonia from storage to nurse tanks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet or exceed all local, state, and national standards relating to storing and transferring ammonia.\n\nAlthough ammonia is a toxic material, records at this facility show that we have never had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences. Specific safety features that we employ to minimize damage from any unusual occurrences include:\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose or line breaks.\n2. Pressure relief valves on each tank to prevent overpressurizing and rupturue of tanks.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained, and periodically retrained, in procedures that re in accord with current ammonia storage and transferring regulations.  In addition, we have coordinated with the Tulia Volunteer Fire Department to respond to emergencies.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenerio defined by the EPA.  This scenario involves a vapor cloud release of the entire contents of the 18,125 gallon tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the impact from this scenario would extend 5.10 miles from our facility.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA's worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break caused by a pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the impact from such a release would only extend 0.38 miles and would not impact any schools, hospitals, or parks."
