We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 25,949-gallon tank, twenty 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and seven 1,500-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Leonard, North Dakota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 56,449 gallons (246,908 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 113,504 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios (NOTE: Available only to LEPC, Fire Department and Maple River Grain & Agronomy)\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source."
