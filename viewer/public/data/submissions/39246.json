Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nRoyal Ridge Fruit and Cold Storage  ( RR ) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of RR to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\n\n    RR refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.\n\n\n\nAt RR anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance ( EHS ) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\n\n? Prevent unnecessary human exposure to the EHS\n\n\n\n? Reduce the threat of exposure to our personnel\n\n\n\n? Reduce the threat to the community and the surrounding ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\nB.    Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nRR is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located approximately one mile south-south east of Royal City, which is located in Grant county and within the state of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at RR is anhydrous ammonia.  Chemical Abstract Number ( CAS ) # 7664-41-7.  The substance is used as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nThere is approximately 9,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the system as of this writing, but RR hopes to increase the total quantity to 13,500 pounds this summer.  The close proximity of this planned increase, directs me towards the safer course and with this in mind I used the greater of the two quantities ( 13,500 ) to calculate the Worst-Case Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario. \n\n\n\nRR uses other haza"

However, RR believes in the concept set forth in the ?General Duty Clause? of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, RR plans to established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.    Worst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis considers two ammonia release scenarios identified as ?worst case? and ?alternative? scenarios.  The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that ?the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst case scenario?.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest vessel would release 13,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would occur inside the compressor room; its walls are in direct contact with the outside, however the effects of building mitigation were not considered.  \n\n\n\nThe distance to the toxic end-point of 0.14 mg/L is 2 miles.  The ?risk radius? extends past the boundaries of the plant, into public receptor areas. Distance was determined by use of RMP-COMP? version 1.07.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario ? Several alternative scenarios were modeled, using ALOHA?, version 5.3, however a release from the bottom (liquid space) of the receiver, under normal operating conditions, was chosen.  This alternative scenario provided the greatest risk radius of .1 miles.  There was no building mitigation used for this scenario.  It was, however, assumed that the safeties and computer control would limit the release to the amount in the receiver.\n\n\n\nBoth the ?worst-case? and ?alternative? scenarios are unlikely due to the safeties on the system such as temperature and pressure cutouts, computer controls and pressure "

      "SummaryText": "relief valves to prevent an overpressure situation.\n\n\n\nA more realistic scenario would be that of a pressure relief valve lifting, discharging ammonia vapor from vents on top of the building, approximately 40 feet above the ground.  In scenarios modeled for this type of an event, the risk radius was reduced to approximately 325 feet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nRR?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\n\n? Initial and continued training of personnel\n\n? Preventative maintenance programs as described in the PSM\n\n? Use of safety equipment and procedures\n\n? Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\n\n\nRR complies with:\n\n\n\n? OSHA?s and Washington State?s process safety management rules\n\n? Washington State?s General Safety and Health Codes\n\n? Various Consensus Standards applicable to Ammonia Refrigeration\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Piping and equipment is secured and protected; compressor (engine) room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems RR utilizes include:\n\n\n\n? Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely from a company laptop-modem system or from the manufacturers location in Yakima\n\n? Suction trap hi-level float\n\n? High discharge pressure shut down\n\n? Low suction pressure shut down\n\n? High discharge temperature shut down\n\n? Oil pressure failure shut down\n\n? High amperes shut down\n\n? Automatic timer to prevent short cycling via computer controls\n\n? Oil filters plugged shut down\n\n? 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\n? 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\nOperating Procedures and checklists have been prepared by RR to be used by employees performing operational functions.  Procedures are kept in Dan DaSilva?s office.  These procedures include: \n\n\n\n? Pre-start up procedures\n\n? "

Planned Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nCommencing in August and concluding approximately February of 2005,  RR plans to add  64,000 square feet of freezer and storage area to it?s existing facility.  This new structure will be connected to the existing computerized monitoring and control systems.  All safety components of this system shall be incorporated into the new construction.  \n\n\n\nAdditionally, a floor heating system shall be installed as part of the projects freezer room.  Heating the floor will keep the soil below,  thawed during the winter and reduce the possibility of frost heave and thus potential damage to NH3 piping that is anchored to the floor.\n\n\n\n"
