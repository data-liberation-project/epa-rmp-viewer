      "SummaryText": "1.0    SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n1.1    SOURCE\nThe Muller-Pinehurst Dairy is subject to the United Stated Environmental \nProtection Agency's (USEPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) for \nAccidental Chemical Release regulation (40 Code of Federal Regulations \n[CFR] 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the \nthreshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) \n(Chemical Abstract System Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia is a \ngas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system \nis used to control the processing and storage temperature for ice cream, \nmilk, and related products.  It is a closed system that contains \napproximately 13,800 pounds (i.e., 2,600 gallons) of ammonia in various \nphysical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the \nhigh pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 pounds per \nsquare inch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 2,840 pounds of \nliquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90 percent).  However, \nduring typical operation, the vessel holds only about 1,300 pounds.  Most \nof the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, \nmake-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \npiping, and equipment.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Muller-Pinehurst Dairy ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage \nsystem.  The high pressure receiver supplies high-pressure (135 to \n190 psig) liquid ammonia to several units including:  the 3-barrel ice cream \nfreezer, lower cooler units, Mueller vat, ante room units, glycol chiller, \nsmall hardening room unit #2,"

The receiver also feeds ammonia to the intercooler, which in \nturn feeds additional units including: storage area unit, large hardening \nroom unit, small hardening room unit #1, new and old ice builders, and \nhalf-gallon air units 1 through 3. \n\nThe Mueller vat, hardening rooms, storage area, and ante room units \nreturn liquid/vapor ammonia to one of three suction traps.  The suction \ntraps are designed to supply liquid free suction to the booster \ncompressors.  Booster compressors supply ammonia vapor at 25 psig to \nthe intercooler.  Ammonia vapor from the intercooler is fed to one of five \nhigh stage compressors (four reciprocating compressors and one screw \ncompressor).  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \ngas), at 135 to 190 psig, is vented to two condensing towers.  The \ncondensed liquid is returned to the high-pressure receiver.\n\nA recirculator receives a liquid/vapor ammonia stream from the \nhollywood cooler units, lower cooler units, and McDonald's dock air unit.  \nLiquid ammonia is recirculated to these units via a pumper drum.  High-\npressure suction is directed to the booster compressor discharge header.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific \nsafety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room \nventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the \ncompressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, \nand the intercooler from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety \ninterlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts \nfor the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for the system \nvessels.  The high-pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n\n2.0    POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of \nammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from \nleak"

While these incidents can impact \nemployees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or \nrepresent an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the property line).\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined \nrelease scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative release) were \nanalyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the \nammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  This \nendpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which \nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without \nexperiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could \nimpair their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in \nthe USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration \n(the \"Model Plan\"), dated November 1998.  This guidance document used \nthe SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct \"lookup\" \ntables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the \nendpoint distance.\n\n2.1    WORST-CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic \nrupture and complete loss of the maximum contents of the high pressure \nreceiver (approximately 2,840 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute \nperiod.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the \nModel Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was \nestimated to be 5,060 feet or 0.96 miles.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it \nshould be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and \noperation of the high pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is \nextremely remote.

In addition, the vessel is \ninspected daily by a plant facility mechanic, trained in the operation of the \nsystem.\n\nThere are only two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment \nof the high pressure receiver:  (1) the internal pressure were to increase \nuncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside or (2) rupture of the \nvessel wall due to inadvertent contact and damage from the outside.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum \nallowable working pressure) of 250 psig and because of the safety factors \nbuilt into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately \n1,000 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  Such \npressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external \ncause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface radiation \nfrom a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessel.  If this were to occur, the \nvessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to relieve internal \npressure at 250 psig.
