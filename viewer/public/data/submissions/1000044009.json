      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Chemical Corporation (FCC) has one chemical on-site that exceeds the threshold quantity of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as established in the 1990 Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and described in detail in 40 CFR 68.  This chemical is anhydrous ammonia which has a single designated storage tank and is used as a raw material in a certain discrete process.  FCC receives ammonia principally by pipeline and infrequently by rail car. The unloading processes are continuously monitored.\r\n\r\nThere is no flammable gas worst-case release scenario because FCC does not store any RMP flammable chemicals above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nUsing the EPA defined process, an ammonia tank rupture represents FCC's worst-case toxic chemical release scenario.  FCC has a 112,800 gallon pressurized liquid ammonia storage tank.  This scenario assumed the tank was at the normal engineering controlled level maximum of 347,000 pounds of ammonia; the ammonia completely vaporized in 10 minutes.  This occurred when the very worst weather conditions occur, which is a calm night with a very gentle breeze at 1.5 m/s and an extremely stable atmospheric stability class of F.  By EPA 's definition of the worst-\r\ncase scenario, FCC must ignore every active response procedure in place to mitigate the release.  The end-point for this scenario is 9.7 miles downwind of the release, using EPA's RMP*Comp modeling program.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia alternative release scenario is a complete relief valve failure.  Unlike the worst-case scenario definition, the EPA allows companies to assume Operator response to reduce the off-site consequence of the alternative release scenario, as long as the consequence goes off-site.  Approximately, 14,500 pounds of ammonia would be released to the air, as determined by an orifice flow calculation.  FCC assumes the release would occur when the wind speed is three miles per hour and the atmospheric stability is a D category.  The end-"

The end-point would be contained inside the Industrial Park.\r\n\r\nIf either of these highly unlikely events ever occurred, FCC has an Emergency Response Plan in place. For the alternative scenario release, while the Shift Supervisor would be making emergency notification, an Operator would immediately prepare to close the emergency manual shut-off valve between the relief valve and the tank.  This process would take no more than twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nOther Operators would be designated to assist this Operator and would operate the fire monitors, using the water spray to reduce the ammonia release.  In addition, the water deluge valves would be activated.\r\n\r\nFCC utilizes OSHA's PSM program to reduce the likelihood that this worst-case release or the alternative release never occurs.  There are formal review programs beginning with the initial determination to produce a product, continue through the entire premanufacture process, and are ongoing after manufacture begins.  Listed below are some of the formal procedures used to insure the safe storage of ammonia:\r\n \r\n1)  Equipment selection is part of a formal review by Certified Professional Engineers.  In the case of this ammonia tank, the selected tank had a one and three sixteenths steel wall thickness. Independent companies performed ultrasonic tests and the Brunell Hardness Test on the tank to certify the tank meets the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) ammonia storage tank requirements.\r\n\r\n2)  FCC staff performed a formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) before process startup.  Any change to the equipment or any modification to the tank or piping require the PHA to be repeated.  One concern identified in this analysis was the possibility of the pressure relief valve venting.  While the relief valve is a required piece of equipment, if it vented and failed to reseat, the PHA analysis revealed the release could be si"

The PHA required the relief valve to be removed annually and inspected by an independent, certified inspector to insure the valve parts would be maintained and inspected regularly.  In addition, since overfilling would cause the relief valve to activate, FCC installed an automatic high level shut-off valve and alarm.  Automatic \r\nshut-off valves were installed on each fill and discharge line.\r\n\r\n3)  Operating procedures are written and available to all Operators for safe handling and storage transfers.   FCC has a formal Management of Change procedure detailing in writing changes associated with equipment, procedures, and personnel.\r\n\r\n4)  Each Operator must pass process-specific qualification before assignment to this area.  Competency is determined by written and oral testing.  After this initial testing, FCC has ongoing training for operating and safety analysis, as well as hazard response.  Each shift has members on the Emergency Response Team, which receives additional emergency response training.\r\n\r\n5)  A formal preventative maintenance program is in place to monitor the integrity of the tank, lines and pumps.  FCC performs an ultrasonic testing of the tank every 5 years.  The tank is emptied and internally inspected every 10 years.  Operators visually inspect the tank, lines and pump several times a shift.  The pumps are formally checked every week.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Chemical Corporation has not had a release of any RMP chemical that has had off-site health or injury consequences for the past five years.  The scenarios described above are hypothetical and have never occurred at this location.\r\n\r\nIf a release should occur that would create an off-site hazard, FCC will immediately notify the Industrial Park industries and emergency responders in the community.  The Fire and Police Departments will notify the community of the status of the release and the actions to take using public address systems.  These actions will depend upon the direction of wind, th"

Our Environmental Policy states:\r\n\r\n \"It is the policy of First Chemical Corporation to provide employees with the training, tools and equipment necessary to operate and maintain facilities in compliance with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, and promptly report to employees, customers and the public information on the health and environmental hazards of our products, processes and waste materials.\"\r\n\r\nOperators continuously walk through the plant observing for and reporting immediately all leaks, odors, spills, contractor work practices, and other dangerous situations.  A Work Order and Hot Work procedure are utilized for maintenance and contractor activities.   In addition, the Maintenance Department has written procedures specifying critical tests, calibration for instruments, and pump and tank inspections.  Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) are performed for every process before construction begins, making sure that all factors of safe storage and handling of the chemicals are considered and safety measures are incorporated into the unit.  FCC updates PHAs every 5 years or more frequently if process piping or a tank is modified.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Team has designated members and emergency response \r\nequipment, conducts frequent training on response techniques, and regularly performs a emergency response drills.
