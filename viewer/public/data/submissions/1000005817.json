The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The GCC PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of GCC to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  \n\nA A?Non-responding facilityA? policy has been adopted.  The Company also recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (San Luis Obispo County CUPA) and the California Dept of Forestry Fire Department.  Appropriate reports such as the California Hazardous Material Business Plan are filed with these Agencies at "

Qualified personnel trained beyond 1910.120(q) Awareness Level would support the Public Responders in the event of an emergency.\n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nGuadalupe Cooling Company (GCC) is a refrigeration plant located 1.1 miles north of Guadalupe, CA.  Frontier Industries constructed the initial facility in the early 1980A?s, according to the codes and standards locally adopted at that time.  Sawyer Construction and Western Precooling Systems assisted with expansions and upgrades over the next 17 years, according to the codes and standards in effect in their particular time-frames.  The overall site occupies approximately 20 acres of land.   Several commercial neighbors are located on the same property.  Farmland (row crops) surround the facility.  The Cabrillo Highway (Highway 1) runs along one facility border.\n  \nThe facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables, ice-making, and short-term refrigerated storage before the fresh produce is shipped to destination points.\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia CAS 7664-41-7 (NH3).  Refrigeration equipment consists of Pressure Vessels, HydroVacA? Vacuum Tubes, Compressors, Ice-making equipment, Pressure Cooling Equipment, Cold Storage Room Evaporators and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  Vacuum Tubes and Pressure Cooling units are used to pre-cool agricultural product; the refrigerated storage portion of the facility is used for short-term product storage.  Evaporators in the storage section of the facility maintain temperature until product is sold and shipped.  The refrigeration system is configured in a closed-loop system with safety cut-outs, isolation valves and overpressure relief valves installed in key areas.  GCC is a partner in one portable Vacuum Tube (VT).  Depending on geo"

The portable refrigeration equipment concept has been in use for over 50 years and is common to the industry. \n\nGCC is supported by an affiliate company, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  WPS is a statewide and well-known provider of ammonia refrigeration equipment and maintenance services.  GCC may rent or lease portable refrigeration equipment from WPS (or other reputable companies) depending on its own seasonal cooling needs.  \n \n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established in accordance with CCR 8, 5189.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and process, and to prevent accidental releases.

Other safety programs are integrated with the PSM Program, to the extent practicable and appropriate.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA?

The incident resulted in no on or off-site consequences.  Emergency Responders and Regulatory Authorities were notified, but the incident was not considered an emergency response.  The work area was evacuated of non-essential personnel as a precaution.  The offending Condenser was repaired as a temporary measure, then replaced with a new unit.  \n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Personnel not trained beyond OSHA 1910.120 (q) Awareness Level notify and evacuate.  Only the responding Fire Department(s) would respond to an actual emergency; GCCA?s 1910.120 (q) personnel trained beyond Awareness Level would be available for support.

The Hazardous Material Business Plan and the Emergency Action Plan detail procedures for non-responding personnel.  The Hazardous Material Business Plan contains procedures for small spills and procedures applicable to materials other than ammonia.
