      "SummaryText": "Facility and Substance Overview\n\n\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. distribution center located in Tobyhanna, PA distributes consumer health products for the various consumer products companies that fall within the J&J Group of Consumer Companies.  The aerosol products stored and distributed primarily include the following trade names: Neutrogena Sun Block Spray, OGX hair care products and Aveeno skin and hair products.  These products each use various amounts (or none) of the following propellants [Butane (#106-97-8), Isobutane (#75-28-5), Difluoroethane (75-37-6), Methyl Ether (#115-10-6), Isopentane (#78-78-4), Propane (#74-98-6)].  This facility is leased by Johnson & Johnson, staff and managed by FedEx Supply Chain.\n\n\n\nThe consumer aerosol products are typically in metal containers, 8.5 ounces or smaller in size, including the product ingredients, as well as the propellants.  The individual containers are typically packaged in corrugated shippers.  The shippers are typically stacked on a pallet, on which there may be up to 6,000 individual containers.\n\n\n\nThe palletized loads are stored in steel pallet rack equipped with NFPA Scheme-A fire protection (heat baffling and in-rack sprinklers).  The Tobyhanna facility warehouse is approximately 1,373,400ft2.  The facility warehouse is split into three buildings with a fire rated wall between the buildings.  In addition to the NFPA Scheme-A fire protection for flammables and combustibles, there is ESFR fire protection throughout the general warehouse.  There are 24-hour security personnel and systems monitoring the facility for a potential event.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOver the previous five years the Tobyhanna Distribution Center has experienced no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case scenario was perfor"

      "SummaryText": "med based on the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Based on the assumption that the entire contents of a cloud explosion (quantity based on product weight of one palletized unit load of each) the calculated distance (in miles) to the one psi endpoint were all calculated to be less than or equal to 0.06 mile (the worst-case scenario was for Isobutane and Propane mixture as detailed in the Offsite Consequence Analysis included in the submission).  The calculated distances do not extend beyond the site property line (no offsite receptors are impacted).  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency and a potential release of flammable materials within the facility, Local Emergency Responders (Coolbaugh Township Fire Department) would be contacted through the use of 911; secondary contact would be made to the Monroe County Office of Emergency Services.   \n\n\n\nEmployees of FedEx and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. are trained and instructed to evacuate through the nearest exit in the event of a release, fire or other evacuation signal.  Employees are not responsible for any action required to contain a release or to extinguish a fire.   Emergency Response Plans and Procedures include a Hazardous Materials Inventory Summary.\n\n\n\nSafety/ Risk Assessment\n\n\n\nIn addition to monthly routine internal facility inspections, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. contracts Factory Mutual (FM) Global for Risk Assessment and underwriting.  At least annually, FM audits the facility with a team of engineers for the purpose of minimizing potential risk of catastrophic events.\n\n"
