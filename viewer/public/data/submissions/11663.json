Drinking water produced at these two facilities exceeds the quality standards set by the USEPA and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.  Water treated at these facilities comes from pristine, high mountain lakes, and City managed reservoirs.\n\nThe City of Aurora Kuiper Water Treatment Plant (Kuiper) is a direct filtration, drinking water treatment facility.  Kuiper was built in 1965 with an original treatment capacity of 20 million gallons per day.  From two subsequent plant expansions, the plant is now able to treat 70 million gallons of drinking water per day.  With each expansion, the facility was updated to meet the existing building, fire and construction codes. In addition, operation, instrumentation and monitoring equipment were updated to enhance treatment.  Overall, Kuiper produces an exceptional product safely and economically.\n\nDuring the next two years, Kuiper will undergo an extensive rehabilitation.  This project will upgrade the facility employing state-of-the-art equipment, replacing components from the original construction.  The project will also improve treatment operations, increase plant capacity and modernize people spaces.  The rehabilitation will enable the facility to operate well into the next millennium, while saving the taxpayers millions of dollars to construct a new treatment facility.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nChlorine is used at this facility for disinfection of source waters. Chlorine is handled in 1-ton containers.  Containers are housed in a room specifically designed for chlorine handling.  The room is enclosed with a fan mounted at floor level in case of accidental release.  A chlorine \"B\" kit is stationed on the southeast wall of the room.  Standard operating procedures (SOP) require eight cylinders to be on-line for disinfection purposes.  The cylinde"

SOP for chlorine cylinder delivery, replacement, and return is detailed in the vendor SOP, facility SOP and Safety Manual.\n\nAs a result of the rehabilitation, a chlorine room which meets the current applicable codes, USEPA and American Water Works Association (AWWA) regulations will be constructed. New chlorine feed systems, and apparatus and chlorine scrubber, which removes chlorine gas from exhaust air, will be installed.  Thus, improving treatment and safety operations.\n\nAmmonia feed system was installed in 1988.  Ammonia is used to maintain the chlorine residual of finished water in the distribution system.  Ammonia is stored in a bulk 4,500 gallon tank and managed in a 500 gallon day tank inside of the building.  A possible release of ammonia would most likely occur inside of the plant, thus limiting the possibility of public exposure. SOP for ammonia delviery and handling is detailed in the facility SOP and Safety Manual.\n\nDuring the rehabilitation , an ammonia room which meets current applicable codes, USEPA and AWWA regulations will be contructed.  New ammonia feed systems and apparatus will be installed.  Thus, improving treatment and safety operations. \n\nFacility Safety\n\nOf utmost importance to the City is the safety of the public, environment and its employees.  In order to maintain safe conditions, the City has developed plans for responsible operations of the plant, emergency response, and routine maintenance.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and response policies are embodied in the Kuiper SOP and Utilities Department Water Operations Group Safety Manual).  The Safety Manual is updated every five years.  In addition, Kuiper has cooperated with local emergency responders to develop emergency response operation procedures.  Training drills have been staged with the Aurora Fire Protection Department.  Accid"

Policies in these documents have been developed with the cooperation of the City's Risk Management and Fire Protection Departments.  Employees are trained to response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nThere has never been an accidental release of ammonia at the Kuiper plant.  This is attributed to well trained staff and continued preventative maintenance.  In the past five years, one accidental chlorine release was reported.  The accidental release occurred May 27, 1998.  The release was an exposure incident of minimal quantity, less than one pound.  There were no off-site, nor on-site consequences which resulted in death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, or public evacuation and no persons were exposed to the gas.  The circumstances surrounding the release were investigated and corrective actions were performed accordingly.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan is in place at the facility and is coordinated with the City of Aurora Fire Protection Department, Aurora Police Department and the LEPC.  Drills are conducted on a regular basis to keep responders and plant personnel up-to-date on the latest response strategies."
