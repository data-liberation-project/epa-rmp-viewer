Wherever possible refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic). The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel.\n\n\n\nWhiteWave Foods is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration system. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Jacksonville Fire Department and the County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n2.0  White Wave Foods and Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n\nWhite Wave Foods processes and cools milk, cream, and soy products for national distribution. Approximately 13,461 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at White Wave Foods. A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia from the system.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is similar to a household refrigerator in that there are no normal releases or discharges of ammonia from the process.  The ammonia flows through the process in a cycle that is closely monitored by both in-house personnel, as well as outside experts (refrigeration technicians / operators).\n\n\n\n3.0  Accidental Release Pr"

Specific regulations include: OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule; OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER); OSHA Hazard Communication (HAZCOM); OSHA Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans; EPA Risk Management Plans (RMP). \n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nWhiteWave Foods maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design details associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies so that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is typically \"What If Scenarios\". The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are re-validated at a minimum of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are documented and addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, WhiteWave Foods maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown. The information is re"

Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nWhiteWave Foods carries out documented maintenance checks on ammonia refrigeration system equipment to provide proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at WhiteWave Foods to manage changes in ammonia system technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia system modification are promptly made aware of and offered training that addresses the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-start up safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system, or any of its components, is opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nWhiteWave Foods conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nWhiteWave Foods believes that Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information related to PSM and RMP implementation, including Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) information.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and/or construction activities related to the ammonia refrigeration system. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. WhiteWave Foods has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work with the ammonia systems. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n\n\n4.0  Five Year Accident History.\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulation defines an \"RMP Accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?

The program includes written procedures for proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat human exposures; and procedures to review and update the plan and ensure that employees are informed of changes. The facility emergency response plan is coordinated with the local fire department as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act.\n\n\n\n6.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety at White Wave Foods.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the components of the Program Level 3 RMP and associated PSM program, which has resulted in improved safety at our facility. Some of these components include ammonia refrigeration system safety training, employee training, management of change policy & procedure, standard and emergency operation procedures, incident investigation policy and procedures, RMP compliance audits, etc.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) studies and Three-Year Compliance Audits have been conducted in the normal course of PSM/RMP program implementation that generated corrective action items to improve the overall safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system and the facility.
