Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies. The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\n\n4.0\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant chlorination processes.  The following details the prevention program elements at The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1\tSafety Information\n\nThe GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant processes.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n4.2\tHazard Review\n\nThe GWWSB C.
