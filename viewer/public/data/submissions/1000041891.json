      "SummaryText": "The Fox Metro Water Reclamation District (FMWRD) is dedicated to the transport and treatment of wastewater in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment.  Protecting the health and safety of FMWRD employees as well as the general public during wastewater treatment activities is the primary objective.  FMWRD prides itself in its excellent operating record.  The facility was first constructed in 1929.  In the last 40 years, no accidents have occurred which would put the public or the environment at risk.\n\n\n\nThe FMWRD developed a safety committee which is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the safety rules and procedures.   This committee meets monthly. The committee is made up of management and labor representatives, which act as a resource for FMWRD.  The safety committee is responsible for accident and injury records, development and implementation of the safety and education program, safety inspections and safety standard compliance.\n\n\n\nFMWRD treats approximately 32 million gallons of wastewater on a daily basis (mgd).  It is designed to eventually treat 42 mgd. The general process for treating wastewater utilizes physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove pollutants.  First, bar screens and grit chambers remove large debris while primary settling basins permit smaller particulates to settle out from the influent flow stream.  The flow is subsequently mixed with activated sludge (bacteria) which remove organic pollutants through the bacterial metabolism.  The bacteria are then allowed to deposit into secondary settling tanks.  Finally, the flow is passed through sand filters, disinfected, and discharged into the Fox River at levels below the compliance standards allowed by the IEPA.\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was created to address methane only.  The remaining chemicals that are utilized by FMWRD do not exceed the mandated threshold quantities.  Methane is a flammable gas which is created through the anaer"

      "SummaryText": "obic digestion process.  Anaerobic digesters are large tanks where bacterial activities are utilized to decompose organic solids from wastewater.  These organic solids are called sludge.  The process of anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge eliminates pathogenic organisms, reduces the amount of materials that require ultimate disposal, creates a sludge which can be easily dried and utilized for farmland enhancement, and creates gases that can be used as a fuel supply. \n\n\n\nAccording to FMWRD's 2014 digester data, the gas created from the anaerobic digestion process contains on average 62% methane, 35% carbon dioxide, 1.5% nitrogen, and 1.5% water.  This gas is collected from the digesters and used in the boilers or stored in a sphere for later use and the excess gas is burned off by on-site, permitted flares.  \n\n\n\nFMWRD operates a Temperature Phased Anaerobic Digestion (TPAD) process for processing the biosolids.  There are four fixed dome anaerobic digesters (M1, M2, M3 and M5) and a fixed dome intermediate storage tank (IS tank).  A fifth digester, M4, is currently utilized for storage, where 3,000 cfm of fresh air is pulled through the tank and therefore, no methane builds up in M4.  M1 and M2 are used as thermophilic digesters and M3 and M5 are used as mesophilic digesters.  The IS tank is also operated under anaerobic conditions.  All of these processes generate methane.  \n\n\n\nThe digesters, IS tank, and the associated piping store approximately 13,820 pounds of gas and the capacity of the sphere is approximately 6,545 pounds of digester gas.  Therefore, the total maximum amount of digester gas present on site in one day is 20,765 pounds.\n\n\n\nRMP* Comp, a software modeling program created by the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Cameo team of the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division was utilized for two scenarios: a worst case sce"

      "SummaryText": "nario and an alternative scenario.  Appendix F: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants of the EPA Risk Management Plan Guidance was extensively consulted for determining the modeling scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario modeled was a vapor cloud explosion of all of the methane from the largest vessel, in this case, the sphere.  Instantaneous failure of the sphere could potentially produce a vapor cloud explosion scenario within a 0.20 mile radius.  The modeled alternative scenario was a slower release from the sphere over a ten minute time period and a subsequent explosion.  Failure of the gas sphere would cause a vapor cloud explosion scenario within a 0.10 mile radius.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nThe Release Prevention Program consists mainly of employee health and safety training, preventative maintenance, and strict operating procedures.  Employees are trained immediately upon employment and updated annually thereafter on proper welding and cutting procedures, lock out/tag out procedures, proper lifting, hand safety, fork lift operation, hazard communication, fire extinguisher training, and first aid/CPR.   Preventative maintenance prevents breakdowns, reduces wear, improves efficiency, and extends the life of equipment and structures while enhancing the reliability and dependability of the wastewater treatment equipment.  Strict operating procedures ensure that the proper start up/shut down sequences are utilized when operating equipment.  The IEPA Bureau of Air conducts periodic inspections with regard to the sphere and digesters.  The most recent inspection was July 2014.  No modifications or deficiencies were noted by IEPA for FMWRD's correction.  The Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) also inspects the sphere biannually.  As of the most recent inspection, no problems were noted by the OSFM.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nFMWRD has had no accidental releases of methane in the past five years.  No one eith"

The employee(s) first aware of the emergency would notify the emergency response center who in turn would immediately notify the appropriate emergency responders (Oswego Fire Department and Kendall County Sheriff's Department).  Select employees at the facility have been assigned duties in the event of an emergency and are trained to fulfill those duties and assist professional emergency responders."
