      "SummaryText": "In February 2017, a fire that occurred overnight and began in an area unrelated to the covered processes at the existing facility resulted in catastrophic property damage to the buildings located at the site. This included a refrigerated warehouse that contained an ammonia refrigeration system and a poultry processing facility that also contained an ammonia refrigeration system. Both buildings were significantly damaged due to the fire, and the buildings and covered processes were decommissioned after the fire in 2017. The existing structures and debris were removed from the site, and plans for construction of a new poultry processing facility at the location began later in 2017. The construction of the new facility and ammonia system was completed in June 2018. The new House of Raeford facility produces fresh and processed chicken products. Ammonia is used at the facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \r\n\r\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\n\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. \r\n\r\nThe Refrigeration Manager is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \r\n\r\nB.

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health \r\nAct's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.

Description of the Emergency Response Program \r\n\r\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials. \r\n\r\nF.
