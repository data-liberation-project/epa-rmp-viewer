The RMP/PSM manual includes the following sections: 1.) Introduction- includes roles and responsibilities among SNWA employees and an evaluation and rationale of why chlorine is the only RMP/PSM chemical at AMSWTF, 2.) Employee participation, 3.) Process safety information, 4.) Process hazard analysis- the last PHA was completed in July 2015, and another PHA shall commence in 2019, 5.) Operating procedures are reviewed annually and updated as needed, 6.) Trainings that includes HAZWOPER, PSM, PSSR, water treatment SOP, water treatment process, and various safety training are administered by different divisions within the organization, 7.) Contractors who work in the chlorination system are trained in RMP/PSM compliance and are keenly aware of chlorine hazard and safety rules, 8.) Pre-startup safety review was completed for an expanded chlorine facility at AMSWTF in 2009, 9.) Mechanical integrity had been performed by contractors, but that responsibility has been shifted to AMSWTF Treatment Division in 2009, 10.) Hot work permit- if possible, chlorine equipment is dismantled and taken to a mechanical shop in another building to perform hot work, 11.) Management of change is performed on replacement-in- kind and non-replacement-in-kind modifications, 12.) Incident investigations are done for all leaks; whether they exceeded reportable quantity (RQ) or otherwise, 13.) Emergency response plan for chlorine is in a separate stand-alone binder, 14.) Compliance audit- the last self-audit of the AMSWTF chlorine system was completed in 2017, however, the State of Nevada CAPP Division conducts an annual audit of the AMSWTF chlorination system, 15.) Trade secret does not apply to the chlorination system at AMSWTF.\n\n",

SNWS is the primary potable water supplier in southern Nevada.  Our mission is to \"provide world-class water service in a sustainable, adaptive, and responsible manner to our customers through reliable, cost-effective systems\".  \n\n\n\nThe senior management team at SNWA is firmly committed to achieve a safe work place for the employees at our water treatment facilities by protecting their health and wellness while striving to eliminate exposures to highly hazardous chemicals. The goal of the SNWA senior management team is to achieve full compliance with the applicable federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) program, as well as the State of Nevada Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  \n\n\n\nOur commitment to total chemical safety is demonstrated through: \n\n1.) The employment of a full-time chemical engineer at the water treatment plant who is dedicated to evaluate and improve the water treatment processes, \n\n2.) A process safety engineer is assigned to SNWA to focus on the OSHA PSM, EPA RMP and Nevada CAPP compliance programs, \n\n3.)

The SNWA employees remain vigilant in following safe work practices, doing the right thing, and ensuring safety through continuous education and training efforts.  \n\n\n\nSNWA has two water treatment facilities with a combined total maximum production capacity of 900 million gallons per day (MGD) potable water. Both are situated in remote locations and away from the densely populated areas of Clark County, Nevada. The AMSWTF is the larger of the two facilities and the only one that uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  Chlorine is an OSHA PSM and EPA RMP covered chemical.   \n\n\n\nThe SNWA water treatment process starts by pumping raw water from Lake Mead into a contactor building to undergo ozone disinfection where ozone and oxygen gas mixture generated on-site are diffused, mixed and dissolved into water traveling through the contactor to achieve the desired disinfection.  In the event the ozone generation system is down for maintenance, AMSWTF can use chlorine gas as a back-up disinfectant.  \n\n\n\nFollowing ozone disinfection, the ozonated water flows through a channel to the rapid mixers where a coagulant aid is added to combine the waterborne suspended particles.  Water then flows into multiple flocculation basins where the gentle mixing of water and coagulant aid causes the suspended particles to form larger clumps called \"floc\".  \n\n\n\nFrom the flocculation basins, water flows to the multi-media filters where the last step of physical polishing takes place.  As water passes through these filters, \"floc\" is trapped and collected, and the filtered water passes through to the storage clearwell.  A corrosion inhibitor and fluoride are added, then chlorine is added to ensure a sufficient \"residual chlorine\" level is maintained throug"

Access to the two chlorine buildings is restricted to SNWS employees, authorized contractors, or visitors. AMSWTF also maintains an onsite meteorological monitoring station.

The entire process inside the two chlorine buildings is monitored and controlled remotely by operators located in a separate control room, \n\n2.) Chlorine sensors are located inside the two chlorine buildings to continuously monitor chlorine level, \n\n3.)
