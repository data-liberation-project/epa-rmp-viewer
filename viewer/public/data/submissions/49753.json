This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nLamb-Weston's accident prevention/loss control systems and policies involve a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and best-management practices. The OSHA-PSM and the EPA-RMP plans work together to assure that potential on-site hazards and off-site consequences are identified and controlled to the best of our ability, and that the processes are meeting health and safety objectives.\n\nThe RMP Prevention Program is comprised of the 13 elements of OSHA's PSM program: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Operating Procedures, Hot Work Permits, Employee Training, Incident Investigation, Mechanical Integrity, Emergency Planning and Response, Contractor Safety, and Audits.\n\nEmployee participation brought together people that knew and understood the system, from practical experience as well as their technical knowledge, to develop the Plan. Process safety information is a collection of data that allows us to identify and understand the hazards posed by our inventory. Representatives from our skilled work force and Lamb-Weston management, who understood the process being analyzed including the engineering behind the covered process, conducted the process hazard analysis. This analysis identifies potential process failures that could result in an uncontrolled release of ammonia"

Lamb-Weston is committed to providing its employees and the surrounding community with a safe and healthy environment. The Risk Management Program is an integral part of our strong commitment to sustainable development, which means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable development requires reductions in the generation of wastes and pollutants, protection of clean air and clean water, sustainable protection of the land, and the wise use of energy. It requires employee commitment, strategic thinking, innovation, the involvement of our suppliers, new technology and enhanced production processes.\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\nThe Pasco, Washington processing facility produces various potato products such as french fries of various shapes and seasonings. The plant site consists of a main processing plant, raw potato storage buildings, general maintenance facility, boiler/refrigeration facility, primary water treatment facility, and refrigerated cold storage. Activities are conducted at this site during all months of the year.\n\nThe potato processing cycle includes a wide array of steps. The plant purchases the majority of its potatoes from local growers. Since potatoes have a single growing season, they must be held under controlled storage conditions. Prior to processing, the potatoes are separated by size and processing specification. The inspected, washed, peeled, and hand-trimmed potatoes are cut, blanched and fried. The final products are frozen, packaged and prepared for shipping.\n\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each repor"

This system will evaluate safety prior to the work being done, and provide a solid review of the system to assure that once started, it will run as designed. Standard operating procedures are in place for each operating phase and are readily accessible to those workers who operate or maintain the process. In Addition, a policy and procedure are used to assure that proper safety precautions are taken for all personnel performing Hot work. The integrity of the refrigeration system equipment is maintained according to recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices and according to a well-documented preventive maintenance program.\n\nAn extensive training program is in place for those employees and contractors involved in working on or around the process and covers operating procedures, health and safety hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices. The facility also has a training program for all employees and contractors regarding the hazards of the chemical and safe work practices to be used. Part of this training includes monthly safety meetings as well as drills on spill response and plant evacuation.\n\nAny incidents related to the ammonia refrigeration systems are promptly investigated even though the rules only requires investigation of those incidents, which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release. All incidents are analyzed, resolved, and findings shared with affected employees. In order to assure compliance with all elements of the prevention program, an audit is conducted every three years including a report of the findings and documentation of any deficiencies corrected.\n\n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the Pasco, Washington facility in the last five years from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, o"

Both are members of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee.\n\nThe plan applies to all Lamb-Weston employees, visitors, and support service contractors performing tasks and activities as part of ongoing operations. The purpose of the plan is to establish policies and procedures for protecting the health and safety of employees, contractors, and visitors, and to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations.\n\nTraining of employees and contractors includes providing a copy of the plan upon initial employment at Lamb-Weston and reviewing it for their specific assignment, annual refresher training for current employees, and review for all whenever the plan is changed. In addition, plant evacuation drills are conducted on a regular basis.\n\nThe plan is comprehensive enough to deal with all types of emergencies specific to the Lamb-Weston Pasco, Washington facility and defines the following:\n\n\u00bf\tHow to conduct activities in a manner that protects the safety of employees, the public, and the environment\n\u00bf\tPreferred means for reporting fires, hazardous materials incidents, medical, and any other emergencies\n\u00bf\tEmergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments\n\u00bf\tProcedures to account for all employees including contractors and visitors\n\u00bf\tNames of agencies and persons to contact for further assistance, information, or explanation of the plan\n\n1.70 Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe Pasco, Washington facility takes seriously its responsibility for the safety of its employees, neighbors, and community.
