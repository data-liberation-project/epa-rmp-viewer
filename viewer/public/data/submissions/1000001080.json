Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nIt is the policy of Lubrizol to meet or exceed all requirements established by Federal, State and local regulatory agencies.  Our safety policies and practices have historically preceded the regulation of such practices under, for example, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.  \nThe risk communication objective for Lubrizol is that its operating plants will be well prepared to deal with risk communication issues in their local communities and be prepared to act decisively to minimize any impact to the community resulting from industrial activities.  Each Lubrizol plant regulated by the US EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR 68 will complete a comprehensive RMP Plan and submit it to the appropriate state regulatory agency.  This RMP Plan will include an RMP Communication Plan for the plant within its local community.  The objective of the RMP Communication Plan is that the plant will be prepared to: \n\nA? Provide a realistic communication perspective on RMP information and on the plant's RMP submittal to EPA.\nA? Explain the plant's prevention program and safeguards.\nA? Provide appropriate information about the plant's emergency response procedures.\nA? Explain the plant's products and positive impact on the surrounding community.\n\nRisk communication is an integral part of a comprehensive risk management program at Lubrizol that meets or exceeds all requirements of the US EPA RMP rule as well as the OSHA rule 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM).  In addition, Lubrizol is a voluntary member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, which has undertaken efforts to improve community relations through its Responsible Care Initiative since 1988.\n\nPlant managers, HSE managers, and their designees are responsible for the timely development and submission of their plant's overall RMP progr"

The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Lubrizol Plant in Gastonia manufactures latex resins and coatings used in the textile, carpet, adhesives, personal care, metalworking, paint, printing, coating, automotive and flock industries.  The site manufactures more than 500 products sold throughout the world.  The plant is located approximately three miles south of downtown Gastonia just outside the City limits.  The Gastonia facility covers 23 acres, nine of which contains three separate manufacturing plants.  The site was initially developed by Maurice Walsh as Walsh Chemical Company in 1973.  In 1994, BFGoodrich acquired the site and in 2001 Noveon purchased the entire Performance Materials Segment from BFGoodrich.  In 2004, Noveon was purchased by the Lubrizol Corporation.   The plant currently employs 95 people.   The site is serviced by Norfolk-Southern Railroad, is adjacent to US Route 321, and is less than 10 miles from Interstate 85.\n\nAnnual plant payroll is $5 million, paying about $180,000 in county taxes and $550,000 in state taxes.  We buy $3 million in goods and services mostly from local suppliers.\n\nLubrizol is proud to be a part of this hard working community.  The plant and its employees have generously supported the area through the annual United Way, Volunteer Fire organizations, The Salvation Army, The Shrine Club, Holy Angels, Special Olympics, American Business Women's Association, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America, HH Beam, Lingerfelt, Pleasant Ridge Elementary Schools, Holbrook and Southwest Middle Schools.\n\nNearly all finished products manufactured at the Gastonia plant are non-hazardous.  In the manufacture of these products, chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule are used.  The RMP regulated chemicals for this site are acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, vinyl acetate and vinylidene chloride.   Even before the RMP rule was written, Lubrizol Gastonia has had p"

We have long understood the relationship between safety and good business, as reflected by our exemplary and frequently awarded safety performance record.   We welcome the EPA's RMP initiative and see it as an opportunity to continue and expand dialog with our community.\n\nC. Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nLubrizol has in place a thorough, ongoing program of process safety management (PSM).  This program requires implementation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards at the plant to minimize the likelihood of a significant release of a hazardous chemical, and to mitigate the effects of any release that might occur.  Some highlights of our program are:\n\n1. Process Hazard Analyses - Formal process hazard analyses (PHAs) have been performed on all plant operations involving regulated substances.  PHAs are conducted by a team of personnel from a variety of plant experience backgrounds to ensure all aspects of operation are considered.  During PHAs, each piece of equipment involved in the process is individually evaluated for its fitness for duty considering all expected operating conditions.  Startup, shutdown and upset conditions are also considered.  During PHAs, design and equipment weaknesses are investigated to eliminate the weakness or reduce its impact.  Measures are in place to continuously update this information.  \n2. Process Design - Our processes are designed for safety in accordance with applicable industry standards and best engineering practices.  Designs include, as appropriate, automatic emergency shutdown systems, pressure relief devices, ventilation systems and release sensing systems.  Most operations containing chemicals are computer controlled with trained chemical operators acting as backup and monitors.  Computer controls include continuous monitoring of crit"

Computer controls have inputs to detect abnormal conditions requiring automatic shutdown and alarms.  All production areas have sufficient containment, that in the event of a leak, no material will be discharged to the environment.  Concrete containment dikes surround all storage tank areas. \n3. Training - Operations and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on their job tasks, on safe work practices as they apply to their jobs, and emergency contingency actions, before they may operate or maintain equipment.  They also receive refresher training periodically.  Our operating and maintenance procedures, general safety procedures and emergency response procedures are fully documented and updated for any changes in plant operations.  \n4. Maintenance - Each item of equipment at our plant that is involved in maintaining safety or in responding to an abnormal situation is inspected, tested and/or maintained on a frequency that reflects its service and condition.  \n5.   Management of Change - No change to equipment or procedural practices can take place at the plant without a thorough review of the implications of that change to safety or the environment.  No change must adversely impact the safety built into the design and operations of our processes.\n\nOur PSM program is tuned to reflect the specific hazards of the chemicals we use.  For example, our operating, maintenance, safe work and emergency procedures address personal protective equipment appropriate to the material being handled.  Also, equipment is selected based on its intended service and chemical exposure.\n\nD. Five Year Accident History\nWe have had no incidents at the Gastonia plant involving substances included in the RMP rule in the past five years which meet the requirements for inclusion in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nE.

Lubrizol personnel are active in the LEPC.  New personnel are trained on the plan contents and in their duties in the event of an emergency upon initial hiring.  All personnel are trained on the plan contents and their duties at least annually.   The plant emergency response plan meets the requirements of RMP as well as all other EPA and OSHA requirements.  Internal evacuation drills are practiced at least annually.  \n\nLubrizol Gastonia personnel are active in the Local Emergency Planning Committee that is coordinated by the Gaston County Emergency Management Department.  This committee reviews past emergency response situations in the county and prepares contingency plans for any emergency response anticipated in Gaston County.  The committee has members who represent industrial facilities as well as emergency response personnel from local police, fire and medical response agencies.  Mock drills of chemical emergencies are routinely performed.  The Gaston County Emergency Management Department now has an automated phone dialing system to alert residents in the event of an emergency that requires evacuation or other precautionary measures.  This committee has been fully briefed on the contents of this facility's Risk Management Plan. \n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety  \n\nWe expect scenarios such as these ARSs and WCSs to be highly hypothetical and unlikely because of our proven accident prevention programs and operating history.  We take pride in our safety programs and safe operating performance, which has been recognized in recent years by the American Chemistry Council, The North Carolina Department of Labor, The National Safety Council of North Carolina and the Society of Plastics Industry.   We will continue to look for opportunities to improve our outstanding safety record."
