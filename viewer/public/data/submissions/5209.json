The Ispat IHW Facility occupies approximately 2,400 acres.\n\nOperations at the Ispat IHW Facility began on July 21, 1902.  The primary processes include manufacture of iron in blast furnaces and steel by Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) production processes and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) melting. Finishing operations at the facility include the operation of blooming mills, bar mills, several hot strip mill operations, temper mills, annealing furnaces, coating and cutting and shearing operations. Support facilities include power generation plants; recycle and waste recovery operations; and wastewater treatment.\n\nThe facility is bounded to the west by the Indiana Harbor Ship Canal (also referred to as the Indiana Harbor Canal) and Lake Michigan; to the north and east by Lake Michigan; and to the south and southeast by industrial property and Highway 912.  Land use in the vicinity of the Ispat is a combination of industrial, commercial, residential, and recreational areas.\n\nThe Ispat IHW Facility operates under the following General Environmental Policy (ENV-001, 12/15/98):\n\nIt is the policy of Ispat Inland Inc., consistent with the Ispat Inland Inc. Mission & Value Statements, to assign responsibilities for compliance with pollution control rules and regulations as applicable from top management on down through middle management to operating supervisors.  It is the function of management to ensure that the company immediately identifies and responds to developing compliance problems consistent with all regulatory requirements.  To accomplish these objectives the specific company is as follows:\n7 Integrate responsible environmental policies, programs and practices into each business unit as an essential element of management.\n\n7 Plan, install, maintain and operate facilities in comp"

A worst-case release, as defined by the U.S. EPA, involves the complete release, over a 10-minute period, of the largest amount of a toxic or flammable chemical from a process at the facility during weather conditions that would allow the release to have the greatest distance of impact.  Additionally, U.S. EPA requires that these distances be calculated assuming that none of the active mitigation systems that could minimize the effects of the release would be used and that no emergency actions to stop or minimize the release would be taken.\n\nUnder these stringent and highly unlikely requi"

According to computer modeling, harmful effects from this hypothetical release could reach 2.8 miles. \n\nA worst case release scenario might affect the following receptors:\n\nPublic Receptors include:7 45,000 people,7 Mixed industrial and commercial properties,7 Parks, hospitals, schools, a marina, a hotel/casino, and offices.                                                                                                                                                           Environmental Receptors include: Wolf Lake Park, the wetland located northeast of the intersection of 129th Street and New York Avenue and the wetland located south of the Grand Calumet River, north of the Indiana East-West Toll Road, west of S.R. 912 and east of Indianapolis Boulevard.                                                                 \nThe alternative release scenario is considered to be more realistic and of greater use for emergency planning and accident prevention than the worst-case release scenario.  In keeping with the more realistic nature of these scenarios, facilities are allowed to consider how their mitigation systems and emergency response procedures would affect the amount of chemical released.  The area affected under an alternative release scenario was calculated to be within a 0.41-mile radius of the hypothetical chlorine release.\n\nAn alternative release scenario might affect the following receptors:\nPublic Receptors\n7 1,500 people\n7 Mixed industrial and commercial properties\n7 Some residential areas\n\nAccident Prevention\nIn order to prevent accidents, Ispat has implemented a comprehensive safety program that incorporates multiple layers of safety.
