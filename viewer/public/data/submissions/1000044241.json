Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention / mitigation programs.  Enable Midstream's mitigation efforts include; personnel training, safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation / operation / maintenance of our processes.  Enable Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream's emergency response operating procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\n\n    \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE COX CITY NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    \n\nThe Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant, located approximately 9 miles east and 2 miles north of Rush Springs in Grady County, Oklahoma, operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration assist to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  Plant products include pipeline quality natural gas - primarily methane - and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Cox City gas plant which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\n    \n\n?    V-200 Condensate Flash Tank comprised of a C1+ mixture.\n\n    \n\nThis process vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a "

      "SummaryText": "regulated flammable substance that could hypothetically be released and have offsite consequences.\n\n    \n\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, any inventory of regulated toxic substances is maintained below the threshold quantity.  In addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the Cox City Plant follows applicable laws set forth in Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n    \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n    \n\nUnder the RMP regulations, the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant is classified as a Program Level 3 facility.  Under Program Level 3 guidelines, the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing the C1+ mixture.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 365,684 pounds (80% of the maximum tank capacity).  However, for Worst Case Scenario calculations, the full inventory (100% maximum tank capacity of 457,105 pounds) of this tank is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.62 miles (3,265 feet).  Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the WCS for the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant.\n\n    \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Cox City gas plant is a VCE resulting from a release of 8,325 pounds of C1+ mixture over a sixty (60) minute period, resulting from a seal failure at the stabilizer feed pumps.  The hypothetical release is expected to be isolated by an operator in less than sixty minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi ove"

Because the processes at the gas plant which are regulated by the EPA's RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA's PSM regulation, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\n    \n\nEmployee Participation\n\n    \n\nThe Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  Operations personnel also participate in the development and review of operating procedures, Process Safety Information (PSA), and training and mentoring of other personnel.\n\n    \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n    \n\nThe Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant develops and maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe"
