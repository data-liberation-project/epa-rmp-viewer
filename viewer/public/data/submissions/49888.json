The 345,000 square foot facility utilizes approximately 90,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for the cold storage.\n\nThe facility has three individual ammonia refrigeration systems using a standard single or double loop (high-side/ low-side) closed-loop refrigeration design. The systems are contained In three separate buildings.\n\nEach system consists of multiple compressors, condensers, a high-pressure ammonia receiver and low-pressure ammonia vessels, and evaporative condensers, the cold storage systems includes numerous evaporators to provide flash freezing and product storage refrigeration capacity. All of the system compressors have numerous protective controls including motor overload, high and low temperature and pressure, low oil pressure, high and low liquid level cutouts, and pressure relief valves on all equipment.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility's program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. United States Cold Storage, Harrisonburg has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include exhaust purge fans, pressure safety relief valves, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required. Administrative controls are in place that limits the utilization of vessels to less than their Intended capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes proc"

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. United States Cold Storage, Harrisonburg management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the United States Cold Storage, Harrisonburg PSM/RM Program elements. The Regional Engineer has been identified as PSM/RM Program Coordinator for the facility, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements. Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to "

A safety coordinator has been assigned for the facility and monthly safety meetings are conducted with all employees to present safety topics and address any safety Issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, United States Cold Storage, Harrisonburg facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAS) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP\"Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nUnited States Cold Storage, Harrisonburg facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nUnited States Cold Storage, Harrisonburg facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for each plant that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Rockingham Department of Fire and Rescue/County LEPC and the Harrisonburg Fire Depart"
