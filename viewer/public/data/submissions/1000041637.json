The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.  To save lives.\n\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe emergency action procedures provide the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and Mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation. This manual is distributed to all plant personnel upon initial employment and is readily available at the facility.\n\n\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold Plant #80570 facility is located at 660 Fifth Street in Turlock, California.  The facility is situated at the intersection of Firth Street and F Street, approximately one half-mile south of West Main Street. The immediate area is primarily industrial and commercial with residential areas primarily to the north and west.\n\n\n\nThe facility chills and stores a variety of food products such as fruit, fish, and poultry.  The facility operates the ammonia refrigeration system to maintain appropriate temperatures for storing these food products. The facility was originally built in 1953 Between 1956 and 1989 several additional cold storage rooms and an Instant Quick Freeze were added to increase freezing and storage capacity.  The facility currently covers approximately 6.3 acres.\n\n\n\nAmmonia in this facility exceeds the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release prevention. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, the diffuser is located outside the engine room, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold stor"

HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nDeleted per Regulation\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nDeleted per Regulation\n\n\n\nD. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility operates In accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\nIIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Maidng Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\" \n\nIIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\" \n\nIIAR Bulletin R1, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nIn addition, Americold Plant #80570 has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the Cal-OSHA regulation.\n\n\n\nE. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no RMP reportable releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years. \n\n\n\nF. EMERGENCY ACTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency action and notification procedures at the facility.\n\n\n\n1. In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will Immediately go to the nearest public address system and announce: \"ATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - THERE IS AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION)\". A supervisor in the area will determine whether or not the building must be evacuated.\n\n\n\n2. If the building is to be evacuated, the Supervisor will announce over the public address system:\n\n\"ATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - EVACUATE THE BUILDING.  WE HAVE AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION).  WALK ! DO NOT RUN!\"\n\n\n\n3. The alarm system is used to notify employees during an emergency as follows:   \n\n\n\nIn the event of an ammonia release (i.e. concentrations reach 25ppm in the engine room or 25 ppm in the warehouse/docks), the alarm system will automatically activate.  It will sound a single tone fast warble alarm with a visual blue strobe throughout the warehouse.  The ADT "

Employees must leave the area and immediately notify a supervisor, manager, or appropriate person.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia detection system has second level alarms in place.  At 35ppm the ammonia feed solenoid valve and pump are shut down for the specific room sensor location.  Engine room exhaust fans are activated at 100ppm and engine room shutdown is 1% or 10,000ppm. \n\n\n\n&#61607;    An ammonia alarms are located in the following areas:  \n\n&#61607;    Engine room.  \n\n&#61607;    Outside the engine room    \n\n&#61607;    Docks\n\n&#61607;    Warehouse air units\n\n\n\n\n\n4. The Supervisor on duty will immediately (upon hearing the alarm) call 911 to report the leak and give the address of the facility.  He or she will then evacuate the building.\n\n\n\n5. Employees will begin exiting  the building as per the published evacuation plan, and report to the proper area outside the building for a head count.\n\n\n\n6. All Shift Supervisors will report to their assigned areas and perform a head count.\n\n\n\n7. After a complete head count, each Supervisor will report the results of the head count to the person in charge of the plant. The person in charge of the plant will give the approximate working area for any persons not accounted for to the Fire Chief.\n\n\n\n8. When the alarm is over, the Fire Department will determine the extent of the damage, the clean-up procedure and whether or not the shift can be continued.\n\n\n\n9. Notify the Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources, Hazardous Materials Division. The following information should be relayed to the County.\n\n\n\nA? Address of the plant.\n\nA? Callers name and name of the company.\n\nA? Name of the hazardous material released.\n\nA? Time of the release.\n\nA? Quantity of hazardous chemical released (if known)\n\n\n\n 10.
