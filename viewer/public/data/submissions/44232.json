      "SummaryText": "This fully updated RMP plan has been prepared and submitted to the U.S. EPA to satisfy the 5-year update requirements of 40 CFR part 68. The original RMP plan for our facility was submitted on November 22, 2000. An updated Section 1 (Registration Information) was submitted on June 22, 2004 to satisfy requirements arising from amendments to the regulation.\n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nUnivar USA Inc. is a wholesale distributor of chemicals serving a number of key industries. Founded in 1924, the company supplies the food industry, compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings, and public utilities with the chemicals and chemical products required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets. Univar is an active member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass the blending, repackaging, bulk and warehouse storage of chemicals, and their distribution via Univar's fleet of delivery trucks or by approved common carriers. We have four regulated toxic substances present above threshold quantities at our facility. These substances include Ammonia (aqueous), Cyclohexylamine  [Cyclohexanamine], Formaldehyde (solution) and Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid]. These substances are delivered to ou"

The most recent review was performed on 10/07/2000. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nUnivar conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 10/03/2003.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWe promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nUnivar truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contr"

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nThe chemical-specific prevention steps undertaken at our facility include the following:\na. Maintaining minimal inventory\nb. Developing standard operating procedures on safe handling of the regulated substances and reviewing annually to ensure they are maintained accurate and up to date.\nc. Providing emergency response training and equipment to minimize the inpact of a release.\nd. Storing and handling substances in appropriate and sealed UN specification containers and in designated locations based on compatibility and safety considerations.\ne. Ensuring that substances remain in their original sealed factory packaging and are not opened for any reason.\n\n5.Five-year Accident History\n\nOur facility has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.Emergency Response Plan\n\nOur facility carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. The Los Angeles County Fire Department is the primary local emergency response agency with whom our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.Planned Changes"

      "SummaryText": "to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral changes to improve safety are scheduled to be implemented at our facility. These are an outgrowth of the recent Process Hazard Analyses and include the following: conducting additional training in operating procedures (to include inspection of chemical transfer hoses and fitting gaskets prior to starting up daily operation), expanding equipment covered by the preventive maintenance program (under consideration are pumps and container fillers), installing additional signage (identifying specific locations that products are to be stored & new larger labels to more clearly identify emergency stops and complete process shutdowns), and establishing a specified frequency for inspection of ventilation systems (to verify proper performance of hoods in removing vapors). These changes are expected to be implemented by January 31, 2006."

We warehouse these substances in their original factory-packaged sealed containers, and do not open, use or repackage them prior to sale. We must maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand, but for safety and business reasons we also attempt to maintain the levels as low as possible. Cyclohexylamine is also delivered in bulk by tank truck and repackaged into UN specification containers. The maximum quantity of these substances expected to be in inventory at any time is: ammonia 60,000 pounds, cyclohexylamine 140,000 pounds, formaldehyde 65,000 pounds, and hydrogen fluoride 25,000 pounds.\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility we used the U.S. EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp(TM) software to determine the distances to the endpoints for the four regulated substances. Complete details of the chosen scenarios and modeling results are provided in Sections 2 and 3 of this RMP plan.\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA regulations, and was designed and constructed in accordance with the NFPA-58 Standard. The main elements of the release prevention program in place at our facility (stationary source) are briefly described below.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards ass"
