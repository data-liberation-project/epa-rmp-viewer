The water is disinfected with chlorine gas (Cl2) as it is discharged into the transmission pipeline which carries it to selected out-of-city industries and into the City of Amarillo water treatment plant.  A maximum of six city employees work at the pump station during normal business hours.  The pump station is secured after business hours.  A maximum of twelve one ton containers of chlorine gas are stored onsite, with a maximum of three one ton containers being connected to the header at any one time and one in use.\n\nOn going safety training programs cover all phases of plant operation from maintenance and operations safety to safe handling of chlorine.  The Carson County facility also conducts formal training as well as onsite training during normal daily operations.  Due to this safety training, this plant has not had any incidents in the last five years.\n\nHazard Assessment Information\n40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B - Hazard Assessment, outlines a specific set of criteria required to be used in the modeling of worst case and most probable case release scenarios.  Worst case and most probable case scenario modeling was completed using Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospeheres (ALOHA) software.\n\nTo complete most probable case and worst case scenario plume models, the default level of concern for chlorine was set at levels estblished at EPA and American Industrial Hygiene Asociation guidance.  The resulting plume indicates a level where individuals would be able to take protective actions without suffering any serious health effects from a chemical exposure during a one hour or less period.  Most probable case and worst case scenario plume analysis results are conservative est"

Safety data has been accumulated and made available to employees.  The training program has been developed, operations and maintenance SOP's are written and have been implemented.

Continuing requirements of the program will be carried out on the schedules required by the Risk Management Program Rule.\n\nEmergency Response Information\nA controlled release of chlorine product located on the pump station site shall be defined as the escape of gas to the atmosphere in small, non-reportable quantities, resulting from standard operating procedures to connect or disconnect chlorine containers and standard maintenance procedures on the pump station chlorine delivery system.  Minor leaks in the system that can be promptly repaired or shut off shall also be considered a controlled release.\n\nAn uncontrolled release of chlorine which will require the implementation of emergency response procedures is defined as any release other than those examples defined as similar o controlled releases.  Emergency responses to the pump station will be made by the Amarilo Fire Department, in accordance with the facility's emergency response plan and Carson County's Annex Q.  If uncontrolled release conditions warrant such actions, shelter-in-place, evacuation, and public warning will be implemented by emergency management officials.
