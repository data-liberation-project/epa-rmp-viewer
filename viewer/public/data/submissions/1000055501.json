Delano Growers Grape Products is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities.  Delano Growers Grape Products staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards.  The Ammonia Refrigeration Systems, that contain the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia, are used to refrigerated grape juice concentrate produced at the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDelano Growers Grape Products policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and OSHA PSM.  Delano Growers Grape Products trains its employees to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  Delano Growers Grape Products Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Delano Growers Grape Products will contact the Kern County Fire Department to respond.  A designated emergency contact for the plant initiates emergency notifications.  All employees are trained in the proper procedures and their appropriate role in an emergency.  \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration Systems at Delano G"

      "SummaryText": "rowers Grape Products use anhydrous ammonia as the cooling medium for the chillers within each system.  When in operation, the ammonia is in continuous recirculation in each system.  Refrigeration System 1 contains one compressor, one evaporative condenser, one high pressure receiver, one thermosiphon vessel and one chiller.  Refrigeration System 2 contains three compressors, five evaporative condensers, one high pressure receiver and seven chillers.   Refrigeration System 3 contains one compressor, one evaporative condenser, one high pressure receiver and two chillers.  Vaporization of ammonia at different points of the system provides the needed cooling effect.  In addition, as an added safety feature, all relief valves are vented to two interconnected diffusion tanks in order to minimize the potential for atmospheric releases of ammonia. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nDelano Growers Grape Products has implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to manage the safety aspects of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.
