Facility Policy:\n\n    The owners, management and employees of the Farmers Cooperative Company (the facility)-Granville, Iowa location are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. If an accident release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n   The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is stored temporarily in 1000 gallon, approved nurse tanks and distributed for direct application. The maximum amount stored per tank would be 4340 pounds.\n\n3. Worse-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:\n\n   a. The worse-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage/nurse tank (1000 gallon capacity) released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 4340 pounds which is the largest storage/nurse tank at 85 of capacity as limited by design standard. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million or ppm) is 0.8 miles.\n\n   B. The alternate release scenario would be the same as the worse-case scenario. \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n   The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provision of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by the Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the "
