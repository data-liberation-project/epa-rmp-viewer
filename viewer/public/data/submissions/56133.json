Intergal componets of the manufacture of these products are three toxic chemicals (anhydrous ammonia, trimethylchlorosilane, and chlorine) and three flammable chemicals ( acetylene, ethylene, and trichlorosilane). Inventory exceeds the USEPA listed thresholds under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) codified at 40 CFR 68 for all of these products. SiVance has prepared a RMP plan. SiVance has an outstanding record in environmental, health, and safety programs. The following sections outline this RMP program.\n\nOVERALL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nSiVance's Site Director has overall responsibility for the RMP program at the facility with the assistance of the Environmental Safety and Health manager. Together they share the overall responsibility for ensuring that the facility operates in a safe and reliable manner. This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the risk management program. To ensure the RMP is appropriately developed and implemented, SiVance's ownership has assigned the duties of RMP Coordinator to the Site Director, a staff member who has the necessary background, training, and experience for that duty. The RMP Coordinator, acting with proper authority, has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the USEPA RMP elements. In addition, the RMP Coordinator works closely with appropriate staff to integrate the appropriate elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program as required by Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\n\nThe following sections identify the specific responsibilities for various aspects of the RMP and PSM programs\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Site Director has the responsibility for (1) ensuring the off-site consequence analysis for the regulated processes are consistly performed and documented in accordance with Sections 68.20 through 68.39 and (2) selecting the scenarios that will be reporte"
