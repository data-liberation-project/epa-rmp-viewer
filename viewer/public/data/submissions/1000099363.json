We have very well structured programs that meet and/or exceed the regulatory requirements set forth by OSHA and the EPA.\n\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety programs include Emergency Response Plan (ERP), Process Safety Management program; including subtopics and procedures for process safety information. Other important elements of PSM are employee involvement, process hazard analysis, prestart-up safety review, management of change (PMR), inclusion of SOPs and P&IDs, employee training, contractor supervision, mechanical integrity program, hot work program and permitting, incident investigation, lockout/tagout program, confined space entry program, and an environmental monitoring program. These programs demonstrate a consistent effort to minimize or eliminate potential releases; while providing for systematic responses should an emergency occur. Environmental monitoring includes numerous stationary detection devices used to identify minute chemical releases at ppm levels and to generate alarms for immediate response. We also have the ability to alert local emergency response services through redundant modes of communication as well as community siren for alerting our community and neighboring facilities. Based on RAGAGEP and Title V Air Permitting requirements, all instances of environmental alarms, both false and actual, are investigated and documented including findings and actions taken, if required.\n\n\n\nThis executive summary will provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nDescription of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\nOverview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\nFive-year accident history for accidental releases\n\nOverview of our emergency r"

The plant produces phosgene from chlorine and carbon monoxide in our B-5 Building and utilizes railcars of chlorine located just north of this building. The entire operation is secured with a continuous access control system and meets the security requirements of the Department of Homeland Security's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard. Phosgene is the primary reagent that is the raw material in many of our other chemistries on site.\n\nIn summary, we have the following chemicals identified by the EPA as extremely hazardous substances:\n\nPhosgene\n\nChlorine\n\nToluene-2,4-Diisocyanate\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\nAs a Responsible Care Company, VanDeMark Chemical Inc. has a Corporate EHS Policy and a senior management team that is fully committed to protection of the Environment, the Health and Safety of our people, and the support and protection of our community. The VanDeMark team demonstrates this commitment through the frequent interaction with our stakeholders, and the sustained programs that meet and/or exceed regulatory requirements. Elements of these include:\n\nMechanical Integrity program\n\nExcellent standard operating procedures that form the basis of our training program and that integrate regulatory requirements\n\nSecondary containment within our operating areas to prevent accidental release\n\nA comprehensive environmental monitoring program with active detection sensors for our chemistry\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan that is well trained and well-rehearsed with community resources in a Coordinated Emergency Response drill annually\n\nAccident, i"

We foster creating layers of protection from unexpected, unwanted or undesirable situations. We have invested in a distributive control system (DCS) to aid in the monitoring of our chemistry. It also provides situational alarming as well as the capacity to limit, or to mitigate, incipient events before they can escalate to a more significant release. We have emergency generators to help facilitate emergency system functionality in the event of loss of power. We have 23 active monitoring devices strategically placed around the facility to provide early notice at parts-per-million levels of key RMP chemicals, as well as many other chemistries. Our people are well trained in both the operation of the facility and the mitigation of release events. As a Responsible Care Company, VanDeMark Chemical Inc, seeks to continuously improve our system to mitigate a release.\n\nVanDeMark has a 3rd party PSM/RMP audit performed by an accredited organization every three years. Action items are tracked for completion. We also have a 3rd party Responsible Care Management System audit every 3 years with similar follow-up on opportunities raised.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history.\n\nWe have had no release events in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program.\n\nVanDeMark Chemical has a comprehensive emergency response program and is an active member of our local emergency planning committee (LEPC).

We have redundant communication mechanisms in place for interacting both internally as well as with external ER resources. This includes VanDeMark access to the County emergency radio frequency as well as our community resources having access to our internal radio channels. The City's fire department participates in annual tours of our facility to understand both our operations and important response information such as utility locations and shutoff instructions. VanDeMark has a trained Hazmat Team and full response gear located in two separate locations in the plant to allow access for any situation. Also of note is a community siren that can be activated both internally as well as by the City of Lockport with a 75dB level at ? miles.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nEnhanced automation in our DCS (distributive control system)\n\nMore thermal cameras such as the one we recently installed in our waste storage area\n\nWe have a Community Advisory Panel Planned in April and a regional emergency drill planned at our facility in September 2022\n\nInstallation of heat/smoke detectors in MCC rooms\n\nInstallation of railroad track upgrades and improvements\n\nInstallation of fire safe valves on bottoms of storage tanks incrementally\n\nInvestigating options for automatic shutdown of phosgene cylinders in production areas"
