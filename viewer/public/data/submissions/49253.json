All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\n\nThis Distribution Center facility is located in Riverside, California.   Processed food is prepared at this location.  Food ingredients are received, blended, mixed, assembled, and packaged.  The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing.  Ammonia is the most effective, energy efficient and environmentally safe chemical for keeping food at its proper temperature.\n\n3.\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nPlease refer to onsite data (Volume 1: Risk Management Plan) at Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market Riverside Distribution Center.\n\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThe Riverside Distribution Center manufacturing location complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and conforms to industry standards.  The system includes ammonia detection devices, an emergency sh"
