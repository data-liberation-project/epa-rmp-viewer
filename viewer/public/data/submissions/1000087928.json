The RMP shall assist facility personnel in properly handling, operating, and maintaining the hazardous substance.  The goal of the RMP is to implement procedures to prevent accidental releases of chlorine and to effectively respond to those that do occur.  There have not been any chlorine-related accidents in the past five years, but the RMP has put in place a system to document any future accidents.  \n\nDetailed management systems, operating procedures, and training guidelines have been established to prevent accidental releases.  A management system appoints employees responsible for creating and reviewing Risk Management Program.  Operating Procedures provide clear and accurate instructions to employees for both normal and emergency operation.  Training will be conducted and documented to ensure all employees working on or near the process are well-informed of the procedures, hazards, and emergency responses involved in the chlorination process.  \n\nA Process Hazard Analysis identifies hazards involved with the chlorination process and evaluates current safety measures and deficiencies.  A What-If analysis is used to determine emergency responses to various user and mechanical malfunctions.  An Emergency Response Plan creates guidelines to notify the public and has been coordinated with local authorities to ensure an effective response to an accidental release.   \n\nIn evaluating hazard potential and safety policies, a few changes have been planned to improve safety.  A free-standing shelf in the chlorination process room will be removed or secured to the wall so that it cannot fall and damage chlorination equipment.  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) will be procured by August 2015 in order to protect employees in the event of accidental releases.  It has also been recommended to raise the fence height and lock the gates ar"
