It is our policy to adhere to applicable federal, state and local laws.  In an emergency, we request the Denver Fire Department to respond.  The first responder is the Montebello Fire Station #27 at 12927 E. Arbrook, Denver.  Description of facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility produces styrofoam trays primarily for the grocery business.  The facility has one 12,000 gallon above-ground storage tank containing isopentane which is utilized in the foam manufacturing process.\nWorst Case Release Scenario:  The facility's worst-case scenario is a failure of one 12,000 gallon storage tank of isopentane when filled, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (.2 miles) extends offsite, and public receptors consisting of commercial, office and industrial are within the distance to the endpoint.  \nThe facility's alternative release scenario is a break in the 2\" diameter pipe, leading to a ten minute release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (.1 miles) extends offsite, and public receptors consisting of commercial, office and industrial are within the distance to the endpoint.\nThe general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  The facility seeks to comply with the US EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations."
