(ARG), we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* Facility specific information and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulations\n\n* Results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n* An overview of or accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP regulations\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* Certification statement required by EPA\n\n* Detailed information (data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nARG produces petroleum base oils, naphthas, distillates, resins, extracts, gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oils, and blended lubricant products. The oil refinery consists of a Crude Oil Tank Farm, Crude Distillation Unit, Unifiner/Platformer Unit, Isomerization Unit, ROSE (Deresining) Unit, MEK (Dewaxing) Unit, Extract Unit, Boiler House, and Bulk Loading (fuels, naphthas).  Of these processes/areas, the ROSE and MEK Units have each been identified as containing more than 10,000 pounds of a RMP regulated substance (propane) and are thus covered under EPA's RMP regulations.  The remaining processes/areas either do not contain flammable or toxic materials above threshold quantities, or contain mixtures of listed regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity but are exempt based on Su"

The ROSE and MEK processes contain the following RMP regulated flammable chemicals with the potential for causing off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nROSE Unit - propane is unloaded from trucks to E-1 storage vessel (72,000 lbs). Propane is used as a solvent in the ROSE process to extract resins from the cylinder stock charge.\n\n\n\nMEK Unit - propane is unloaded from trucks to D-23/D-18 storage vessel (50,400 lbs). Propane is used for chilling the products charged to the MEK Unit for de-waxing operations. \n\n\n\nNOTE: These values are based on estimated quantities within the vessel. For the 2015 submission a \"Worst Case\" volume was used in which the vessel was assumed to be completely full. This conservative approach was used in that fluctuations in regards to unit shutdowns have increased volumes above the previously stated volumes thus by utilizing 100% inventory this would project for optimal worst case situations.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nWe use our off-site consequence analysis information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address potential scenarios.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key elements of successful provention programs including:\n\n\n\n* Process Safety Information\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n\n* Operating Procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical Integrity\n\n* Management of Change\n\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n* Compliance Audits\n\n* Incident Investigation\n\n* Employee Participation\n\n* Hot Work\n\n* Contractors\n\n* Emergency Planning & Response\n\n\n\nThese el"

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP ruled during the past five years:\n\n\n\nWe have had no accidental releases under EPA's RMP rule in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWe maintain an Emergency Response Plan, which incorporates state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our facility maintains volunteer emergency response teams for responding to emergency situations including a Fire Brigade, Hazardous Materials Response Team, Rope Rescue Team, and First Aid Medical Response Team.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.

These studies evaluated potentially new hazards and addressed any significant issues through recommended actions.
