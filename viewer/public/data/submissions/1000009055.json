An integral part of the production and storage of these products is an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  This inventory exceeds the 10,000-pound threshold for anhydrous ammonia set by EPA under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule codified at 40 CFR 68.  Pursuant to the requirements of the rule, Citrosuco has prepared this Risk Management Program (RMP) Plan. We are proud of our environmental, health, and safety efforts and programs and our record in these areas.  The following sections outline our RMP plan.   \n\n\n\nOVERALL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n\n\nOur Facility Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our President/CEO has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to the facility Safety and Compliance Director, a staff member with the necessary background, training, and experience.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Facility Manager, has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the EPA RMP elements as required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.  \n\n\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facility's RMP Steering Committee.  This committee comprises members with responsibilities for developing and managing specific elements of our risk management and process safety programs.  The members of this committee are assigned by the Facility Manager based on recommendations from the RMP Coordinator.  Currently, the members of the PSM/RMP Steering Committee include the following: \n\n\n\n *  RMP Coordinator/Safety and Compliance Director\n\n *  Production Manager\n\n *  Mai"

The Safety and Compliance Director also is responsible for ensuring that the accident history for each covered process is appropriately documented and maintained in accordance with Section 68.42 and 68.168 of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe rule requires the evaluation of a worst case scenario, even though the likelihood of the occurrence of such a scenario may be extremely small.  The worst case scenario has been defined as a catastrophic release of the entire anhydrous ammonia inventory, 30,918 Risk Management Program Guidance For Ammonia Refrigeration  Model is 3.60 miles.  In addition to the worst case scenario, an alternative release scenario has been modeled employing more appropriate meteorological conditions and release assumptions.  In the alternative release scenario, 100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per minute are assumed to be released due to a piping leak.  Response measures are expected to take 30 minutes to mitigate the leak.  Based upon these assumptions, the distance to the endpoint as predicted by the same model employed above is approximately 0.2 miles.  At this distance, limited impact on public receptors would be anticipated.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe facility has experienced two EPA defined reportable releases within the previous five years. One incident occurred on December 31, 2010 resulting in a small quantity release to the interior of the facility. The second incident took place on June fourth, 2013. T"

Although the RMP Coordinator has some specific individual responsibilities, many of the responsibilities for specific program elements are assigned to other members of the PSM/RMP Steering Committee (as listed in the following sections).\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe responsibility for process safety information (PSI) (Section 68.65 of the RMP rule) is divided into three areas.  The Safety and Compliance Director has responsibility for process chemical information, the Production Manager has responsibility for process technology information, and the Engineering Manager has responsibility for equipment information.  The RMP Coordinator has the responsibility of ensuring that all of this information is readily accessible for use.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule, the RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for ensuring that process hazard analyses (PHAs) are scheduled, conducted, and documented by trained personnel for all regulated processes.  The RMP Coordinator identifies candidate PHA team leaders from within the facility and ensures that they receive appropriate training before leading PHAs.  The RMP Coordinator also uses outside contractors to lead PHAs when appropriate.
