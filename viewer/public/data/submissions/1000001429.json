Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDominion Transmission, Inc. - Hastings Extraction Plant (HEP) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Dominion's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Dominion has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise.  Also, Dominion will contact the Wetzel County Emergency Dispatch to obtain additional resources from local volunteer fire departments, law enforcement and emergency medical services.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nHEP processes natural gas by cleaning and dehydrating it prior to introducing it to a turbo-expander where the heavier hydrocarbons are liquefied.  The resulting product, natural gas liquid (NGL), is then separated into its constituent parts by fractionation, which are marketable as fuels or chemical feedstock.  There are four regulated flammable substances present in the flammable mixture (NGL) produced by HEP which include propane, butane, pentane, and isobutane [propane, 2-methyl].  Propane, butane, and isobutane [propane, 2-methyl] are transported to storage for distribution to end users. Pentane and heavier hydrocarbons are a component of natural gasoline which is transported to storage for distribution to end users offsite.  Flammable mixtures are subject to the rule when one or more regulated substances are present in the mixture above one percent and the entire mixture meets NFPA-4"

      "SummaryText": " criteria. Propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane are all regulated substances present in the NGL product above one percent and is a flammable mixture that meets NFPA-4 criteria.  Thus, the NGL product is a regulated substance under the rule. (Natural gasoline does not meet NFPA-4 criteria and is therefore not a regulated substance under the rule.)\n\nThe NGL product is stored onsite in one of two identical storage tanks (spheres) which have a useable capacity of approximately 900,000 pounds each.  The maximum inventory of the flammable mixture in a both spheres is 1,800,000 pounds.  No regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity are used at the facility.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under Part 68 of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68).  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3.  HEP also maintains an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act (R30103000091996).  A number of processes at the facility are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHEP maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies"

HEP primarily uses the HAZOP method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of at least every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, HEP maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nHEP develops and implements safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\nTraining\nHEP has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Initial training on gas plant operations is provided, and refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years or more frequently as needed.  Both initial and refresher training is documented and records of training are maintained onsite for at least 3 years.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHEP has written procedures for maintaining on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for proces"

HEP carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper installation and operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified and trained personnel carry out maintenance operations at the site.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  The plant also incorporates quality assurance measures to ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for the process application for which they will be used.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at HEP to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  These procedures will be updated as needed.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes will be conducted as a regular practice at HEP.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nHEP conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and are conducted at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are documented in a report.

An incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours after the incident, and will involve at least one person knowledgeable of the process involved.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  A report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and will include any resolutions and corrective action.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nHEP believes that PSM and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit\nHEP will issue a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  The permit shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations; it shall indicate the date(s) authorized for hot work; and identify the object on which hot work is to be performed.  The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\nContractors\nDominion hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and this information includes evacuation routes and assembly points.  HEP will document that the contractor has received and understands the training.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe processes at the HEP have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-regulated processes at the HEP.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  The HEP has safety features on many units to help (a) contain/control a release (e.g., diking and enclosures); (b) quickly detect a release (e.g., hydrocarbon detectors with alarms), and (c) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release (e.g., fire suppression and extinguishing).\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nNo reportable releases have occurred in the past 5 years. \n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nHEP has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as, the environment.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.
