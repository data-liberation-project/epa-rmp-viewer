      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility provides treated water Tenaska Partners in the industrial sector of the City for use as cooling water.  Chlorine is added to treated wastewater effluent before delivery to Tenaska.  The Water Reuse Facility maintains a maximum inventory of 10,000 pounds of chlorine in one-ton containers, which above the threshold level and is therefore subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nChlorine, a chemical required by regulation to be used in the disinfection process, has been in use at the Water Reuse Facility since operation began.  No accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of the five year accident history have occurred at the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Water Reuse Facility is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Water Reuse Facility maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine feed system and has documented the codes and standards adhered to in designing, constructing, and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for the chlorine system are documented, and it is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nAn updated hazard review was conducted on June 8, 2004 for the chlorine system and identified action items are expected to be completed by 12/31/04.  When a major process change is made to the system, there are procedures in place to conduct a hazard review.  Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system are also in place at the Water Reuse Facility.  Procedures are currently being updated. Facility personnel will continue to periodically review and update the procedures and will update procedures whenever a major process change occurs.\n\nWater Reuse Facility operators receive training in the operation of the chlorine system through classes and on-the-job instruction."

      "SummaryText": "Competency is determined through supervisor observation and operator demonstration of activities.  Operators receive refresher training at least every three years, or more often as necessary.  Only qualified operators will operate the chlorine system.\n\nA team of facility personnel conducts a compliance audit of the facility operations and procedures once every three years and whenever a major process modification is made.  A compliance audit checklist has been developed based on American Water Works Association recommendations.  A system to correct any deficiency discovered during the compliance audit is in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, or a situation that could lead to an accidental release, there are procedures in place to investigate such incidents, develop findings and recommendations for corrective action, and implement the recommendations.\n\nPersonnel working at the facility are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine leak.  In the unlikely event a chlorine release requiring the assistance of offsite emergency response personnel occurs, the City of Cleburne Fire Department is responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating the emergency response effort, and notifying potentially affected areas in the surrounding community."
