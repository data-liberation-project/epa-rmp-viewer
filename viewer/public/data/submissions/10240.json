Executive Summary\n\n  Marathon Ashland Pipe Line LLC (MAPL) is committed to operating Woodhaven Cavern\n  Facility (WCF), owned by Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, Michigan Refining Division,\n  in a manner that is safe for employees, contractors, the public, and the environment.  It is the\n  WCF's policy to conduct its operations in accordance with the highest standards of\n  environmental stewardship, employee and contractor safety and community responsibility. \n  As part of this policy, the WCF has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the\n  processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP)\n  that helps manage the risks at the WCF and that complies with the requirements of the\n  Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release\n  Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the\n  requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the\n  risk management program at WCF.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan\n  executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description\n  of the risk management program at the Woodhaven Cavern Facility.\n\n  1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n       WCF has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the public, its employees and\n       contractors and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary element of this\n       commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and\n       around the facility.  WCF utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and\n       detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.\n\n       In the even"

In conjunction with the Wayne County local\n       emergency planning committee (LEPC), the Woodhaven Fire Department  has the\n       ability to notify the local community through media broadcasting systems. \n\n       The MAPL Eastern District Manager has overall responsibility for the development\n       and implementation of the risk management program for the EPA-regulated process\n       at the WCF.

The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  MAPL does not expect a worst-case\n       release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release\n       that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like WCF. Alternative release\n       scenarios can be used to help the LEPC and Woodhaven Fire Department improve\n       the community emergency response plan.  We have submitted release scenarios to\n       EPA, and have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations\n       involved in emergency response activities.

Because some contractors work on\n       or near process equipment, WCF has procedures in place to ensure that contractors\n       (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and\n       skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) unde"

The purpose of the review is to ensure safety features,\n       procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior\n       to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to\n       make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all\n       supporting systems are operationally ready.
