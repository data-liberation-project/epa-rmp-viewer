      "SummaryText": "The Belleville Wastewater Treatment Facility at 450 Environmental Drive, Belleville, IL  62220, is located just east of the St. Clair County fairgrounds.  Our plant is designed to treat eight million gallons of domestic and industrial sewage on a daily average flow.  We treat combined wastewater with primary, secondary and tertiary treatment.  In the tertiary treatment process we use a federally regulated chemical chlorine for pathogen disinfection.  We are permitted for and use chlorine only during storm water flows (not dry weather flows).  Our chlorine is contained in 2,000 and 150 pound cylinders.  We use one 2,000 pound cylinder at a time with another cylinder on standby.  This sytem is controlled by an automatic change over valving system.  The building is equipped with automatic shut off valves, chlorine detector, and emergency repair kits should a leak develop.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program is regulated by the State of Illinois Process Safety \nManagement.  At the time of installation or construction, we have compiled with NFPA58, OSHA, ATM, ANSI, and ASME design codes and safety standards.  Safety information is redily available to plant personnel and we have not had an accident in the last five years.  Management has taken steps to prevent chlorine releases.  These steps include:  written response plans, tank repair equipment, training sessions, operating procedures and leak detection equipment.  We have also developed an emergency response program specifically for the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  This program includes procedures and contact numbers for earthquake, flood, tornado, fire and explosion.  Management has also implemented a program for hazard review and preventative maintenance.  All employees are trained in these procedures."
