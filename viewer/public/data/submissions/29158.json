Landmark Services Cooperative - Dane Agronomy' policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations in order to:\n1. Prevent unnecessary human exposure,\n2. Reduce the threat to employees health, and \n3. To reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\nSafety depends upon the manner in which an accidental release is handled, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the operation, the safe handling procedures used and the training of personnel.\n\nLandmark Services Cooperative - Dane Agronomy complies with the provision of \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Cottage Grove Cooperative - Dane Agronomy's emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, the LEPC and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center as such we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural"

Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 2- 12,000 gallon stationary storage tanks on site.  112,000  pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 270,780 pounds.  \n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\nWorst Case Scenario\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact. \n\nAlternate Release Scenario\nThe most common alternative release scenario(s) from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site. The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a railcar tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 27,000 pounds. This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia facility has implemented the provision of \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no a"
