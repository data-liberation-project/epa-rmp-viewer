The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant processes or other plant facilities.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\nThe overall ERP for the Shell Chemical Company Geismar Plant is coordinated with the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The facility has around-the-clock communication capabilities with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., local fire department).  There is also a community siren warning system for public notification of a significant event.  These systems provide a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\n  \n1.6 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility strives to improve the safety of plant processes through periodic safety reviews, the Incident Investigation Program, proactive safety campaigns, and a safety meeting system for soliciting feedback from employees.  Shell resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process to improve safety."

The HSEGT Process Safety Committee is responsible for overseeing and periodically developing and conducting these audits in conjunction with the tri-annual PSM prevention program audits required by OSHA on the same frequency.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are maintained.  \nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps - The processes at the facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failure and (2) human errors. \nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes.\nRelease detection\n-\tStationary ethylene oxide monitors with alarms\n-\tProcess alarms\n-\tPersonal exposure monitors\nRelease Containment/Control\n-\tProcess relief valves that discharge a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n-\tScrubbers to neutralize/minimize chemical releases\n-\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n-\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high leve"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n Incident Investigation - The facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\nCompliance Audits - To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the facilit"
