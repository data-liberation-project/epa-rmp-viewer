Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Morris Co-op Association in   are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental\nsafety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\nresponse efforts with the Morris Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\nexpertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank, one 18,000-gallon tank, and twenty-four 1,000-gallon\nnurse tanks and three 1,450-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Morris, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The\nmaximum amount stored at  85% standard maximum storage capacity is 64,897.5 gallons (333,962.5\npounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our\nfacility contains 131,223 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.

These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nMorris Co-op Association has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\nwho are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\nprocesses.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMorris Co-op Association conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\nproper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training\nin maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Morris Co-op Association to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nMorris Co-op Association routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\nmodifications in "
