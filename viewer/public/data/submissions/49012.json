The product we use is an aerosol propellant which is also a hydrocarbon product. This hydrocarbon product, although completely safe for the environment is considered a hazardous product by the USEPA.\n\nEnviro-Safe has an OSHA-PSM Plan in place that is adhered to by all Enviro-Safe personnel. The plan also directs all Enviro-Safe staff as to the actions that are to be taken if is a release of product should occur. The plan directs the Enviro-Safe staff to contact the City of Pekin Fire Department immediately if a release of product should occur. The City of Pekin Fire Department responds and notifies all affected.\n\nEnviro-Safe desires to abide by all rules and regulations associated with this product. We follow the guidelines as outlined in the NPGA LP- Gas Safety Handbook.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION: \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Enviro-Safe Refrigerants, Inc. This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the City of Pekin Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. \n\nThis facility is a filling/packaging company. \nThe Enviro-Safe Facility has the following items installed in the tanks and piping: check valves, pressure relief valves, nitrogen shut-off. The facility was inspected and approved by the City of Pekin Inspection Department and the State of Illinois State Fire Marshall. The Enviro-Safe facility was constructed meeting the guidelines of NFPA-5"

Plan in place.\n\nEnviro-Safe is inspected on a regular basis by the City of Pekin Fire Department. The last inspection by the City of Pekin Inspection & Zoning Department, the City of Pekin Fire Department and State of Illinois Fire Marshall in October, 2006.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThis company is an Aerosol Canning facility. The facility consists of an 18,000 gallon and 12,000 gallon tank of  LPGs for propellant in the products canned.\n\n\nWORST-CASE and ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of our 18,000 gallon tank when filled to 80% capacity @ 70\u00b0 F (maximum E.S.R fill) would release 65,000 lbs of aerosol propellant (propane/butane). It is assumed the total contents are released as a vapor \u00bf which then locates an ignition source. It is assumed 10% of the released quantity could result in an explosion. The distance to the end point of 1 psi for the worst case scenario is 0.50 miles.\n\nThe alternative scenario: a truck pulls away  causing a 25 foot length of 4\u00bf hose to rupture. The excess flow valve will function and stop the flow. The unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammable limit. The distance to the endpoint for the lower flammability limit for the alternative scenario is less than 0.10 feet. This release would extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA\u00bfS accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58, state law and O.S.H.A. PSM program.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nEnviro-Safe has never had an accidental release of hazardous product or employee injury in over five years.\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY REPSON"
