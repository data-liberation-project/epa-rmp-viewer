Policy, to comply with company procedures, and to support all compliance efforts.\n\nEnvironmental, health and safety compliance is a responsibility that must be shared equally and without exception by each individual within the organization.\n\nFacility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Distribution Center is located at 2700 Middlebury Street, Elkhart, Indiana. The Distribution Center is adjacent to the APG Inc./KIK Custom Products Main and North Plants that house six aerosol manufacturing lines and one liquid filling line, as well as compounding facilities and storage facilities for raw materials.\n\nThe Distribution Center occupies 210,000 square feet under roof. It has been designed and constructed in accordance with the current building codes and fire standards, and includes features such as a fire protection sprinkler system supported by a pump house, and fire detection and alarms systems that are constantly monitored and maintained by a contracted security company.\n\nThe Distribution Center provides storage of incoming components and outgoing finished products for the Main and North Plants. The incoming components include metal cans, plastic valves and caps, and corrugated boxes. The outgoing finished products are consumer commodities for various sectors including personal care, household, food and pharmaceutical. The finished products include air fresheners, hair mousses and sprays, body sprays, cooking sprays, cleaning products, liquid soaps, shaving creams, and foot sprays. Many of these products are aerosols and contain flammable propellants. The regulated chemicals used as propellants that may be present are:\n\nn-Butane (CAS No. 106-97-8)\nDifluoroethane (CAS No. 75-37-6)\nDimethyl Ether (Methyl ether) (CAS No. 115-10-6) \nIsobutane (CAS No. 75-"

The Risk Management Plan has been prepared to include ?predictive filing,? as the flammable propellant content of the packaged goods in storage may vary from 0 pounds to over 1,000,000 pounds.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Distribution Center has been designed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 30-B, ?Code for the Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products,? the purpose of which is to provide requirements for the prevention and control of fires and explosions in facilities that manufacture, store, or display aerosol products. The Distribution Center has also been included in the Process Safety Management program developed and implemented at the adjacent APG Inc./KIK Custom Products North and Main Plants. The PSM program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the Distribution Center.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents or injuries related to the covered process during the past five years. \n\nEmergency response program:\n\nThe Distribution Center has been included in the \"Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures\" that also addresses the adjacent Main and North Plants. This plan has been coordinated with the Elkhart Fire Department and Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee, as well as the Indiana Emergency Planning Committee. The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills and releases of chemicals, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details actions to be taken for such emergencies, safety equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders.
