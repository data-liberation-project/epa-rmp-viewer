The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC (Helena) is submitting the EPA RMP as an initial submission.\r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  One chemical (i.e. aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration) is stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tCovered Process 1: Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling\r\n\u00bf\tCovered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes.  A single worst case release scenario representing both covered processes was prepared because both processes are physically connected by process piping.  The worst case release scenario assumes that the largest single vessel (i.e. a 20,286-gallon aqua ammonia AST) fails and instantaneously releases all content into the secondary containment that has a total containment capacity of 71,970 gallons when considering displacement of the other ASTs within the containment.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to the rupture of a transfer hose during a transfer operation and the alternative release scenario for"
