The process equipment consists of: (1) three 20,286-gallon ASTs; and (2) a Stationary Blender.  The Stationary Blender ancillary equipment includes a Mix Pot, process piping, liquid pumps, control and check valves, flow meters, pressure and temperature gauges, a weight scale, and a plate and frame heat exchanger.  The Stationary Blender does not have any storage capabilities for aqua ammonia. The fertilizer products are not subject to the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nTrained Process Operators operate the covered process which includes the: (1) transfer of aqua ammonia, water, and other ingredients to the Stationary Blender; (2) monitoring of flows, temperatures, pressures, and weight; and (3) transfer of the fertilizer product to storage.  These operations are conducted in accordance with the RMPr Operating Procedures.  Trained personnel perform maintenance on this covered process in accordance with the RMPr Mechanical Integrity Procedures.\n\n",

The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC (Helena) is submitting the EPA RMP as an initial submission.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  One chemical (i.e. aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration) is stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\n?    Covered Process 1: Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling\n\n?    Covered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes.  A single worst case release scenario representing both covered processes was prepared because both processes are physically connected by process piping.  The worst case release scenario assumes that the largest single vessel (i.e. a 20,286-gallon aqua ammonia AST) fails and instantaneously releases all content into the secondary containment that has a total containment capacity of 71,970 gallons when considering displacement of the other ASTs within the containment.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to the rupture of a transfer hose during a transfer operation and the alternative release scenario for"

      "SummaryText": " Covered Process 2 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to break in the process piping between the liquid pump and Blender that occurs during a blending operation. Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Depot Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Depot Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Depot Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the RMP program includes: Management System, Off-site Consequence Analysis, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nGiven that this is a new constructed Facility, a five-year history is not applicable.  \n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Facility.\n\n"
