Boskovich has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document Boskovich policies addressing the implementation of these regulations.  The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and emergency response and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Boskovich Salinas facility is a new facility which will provide product cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.  Boskovich will  process some vegetables for the \"fresh cut market\".  This processing includes cooling, cleaning, cutting and packaging vegetables. \n\nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Salinas.  Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Refrigeration System (\"System\").  This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system, which was built in 1999-2000.  The intial system start-up will be on or soon after March 20, 2000. The majority of the ammonia equipment is housed inside buildings. One vessel and the condenser are located outside. Much of the piping is located on the roof.  The entire"

Administrative controls were considered in determining the largest quantity.  The High Pressure Receiver (HPR) will contain the full ammonia charge.  The Worst Case Scenario is therefore based on the full system ammonia charge (e.g. the full ammonia inventory).\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system  - in either design or operation.  The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community and regulatory agencies.\n\n\nALTERNATE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\nThe Alternate-Case Scenario selected was an oil draining accident at the oil pot (OP-PP1) in the Machine Room.  The regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.  In selecting the scenario, the Process Hazard Analysis was considered.  Of the potential \"causes of deviation\", the oil draining scenario was selected because it would require human errors and no active mitigation measures are currently in place for this scenario as described below:\n\nAn operator begins to drain oil at OP-PP1 without first checking the ammonia level (visual sight glass).  OP-PP1 is assumed full of liquid ammonia.  After opening the ?\" globe valve to drain oil into a bucket, the operator ties open the spring-close valve (in series with the globe valve) leaves the engine room, both of which are against Boskovich policy.  Once the oil drains, the liquid ammonia in OP-PP1 drains out. \n\nFor modeling of the Alternate-Case Scenario, this analysis used ALSOHA, a modeling  program approved by the EPA.  The room that houses the OP-PP1 provides passive mitigation (reduces the release rate).  However, ALOHA does not consider whether a release occurs inside or o"

The hazard distance is therefore overestimated (the distance is longer than it should be).\n \nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nBoskovich's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.  The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Prevention Program implemented by Boskovich is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\nKey objectives of Boskovich Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1.Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\n2.Thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Boskovich.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter.)\n3.Written procedures and policies that establishes how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.)\n4.Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Boskovich certifies operators following completion of operator training and Boskovich's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training chapter.)\n5.Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \nSecond, all Boskovich employees (dir"

These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\n6.    Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned  (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Boskovich's Management of Change Procedure.  \nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Boskovich has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Boskovich Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possible of a fire. \nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\n7.Verification of Boskovich's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program  (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Boskovich personnel.  Boskovich has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find. (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)   \n8.Minimize employee injury and illness.

The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary.   The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators.  Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \nUnder Boskovich's Emergency Response policy, Boskovich employees who have been trained as \"First Responders\" may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment).  Boskovich will evacuate affected area, begin notification process and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department and/or refrigeration contractor).\n\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study team developed recommendations to improve safety and to reduce the possibility of a release.\nKey recommendations identified during study included;\n? Develop more written policies and procedures.\n? Install concrete barrier at outside vessel (HPR).\nBoskovich has reviewed recommendations and decided to implement all of these measures.  Implementation of the measures has begun according to the schedule set by Boskovich."
