As a chemical manufacturer, we recognize our responsibilities to preserve the environment, encourage safety, and enhance the health and welfare of our employees and the community in which we operate. Our equipment and processes are designed to handle materials safely and our employees are trained to ensure that they do not present risks to themselves, their fellow employees, or the community.  As an American Chemistry Council (ACC) member company we have committed to continuously improve our performance under an industry initiative known as Responsible Care?.  \n\n?    Heico is engaged in the manufacture of organic and inorganic chemicals, producing about 50 different chemicals that are generally classified as bulk pharmaceuticals, food additives, and industrial organic chemicals.  Products have been produced at this facility since 1950. Heico currently employs approximately 35 people at this facility.\n\n?    Community involvement at Heico provides its neighbors the opportunity to learn about the company?s operations and the many ways its products support and improve their daily lives.  In conjunction with local community leaders.  Heico initiated a Hazardous Materials Commodity Flow Study.  The study identified the types and amounts of hazardous materials commodities transported through Monroe County PA.  The results of the study were then communicated with Local CAP (Community Advisory Panel), Emergency Responders, and the LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee).\n\n?    Heico has an emergency response plan for the facility.  The plan has been provided to area emergency responders, including Monroe County LEPC (local emergency planning committee), local Fire companies, and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.  Heico has its own Emergency Response Team that provides 24hr emergency service to the facility for chemical s"

Heico Chemicals conducts emergency preparedness rehearsal exercises to enhance our capabilities as well as those of local emergency responders.  Together, Heico and the area responders are preparing to effectively deal with potential emergencies.  This relationship was recognized by the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) with the presentation of the ?Partnership Award? to Heico, and Guy Miller, Health & Safety Supervisor.  The award recognizes extraordinary contributions to chemical emergency preparedness and prevention programs.\n\n?    Heico places strong emphasis on worker safety and accident prevention.  Conscientious efforts by trained personnel ensure that the Company operates within the guidelines established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and its Process Safety Management Program.  Making sure operations are conducted safely receives the highest priority at Heico. Our operators average 15 years of service.  They?re training and experience prepares them to manage our 24-hour a day, 7-day a week operation so that the safety of our employees and our community are protected.  All Heico operations personnel are required to complete SOCMA Chemical Operator Certification Training, a course designed by, SOCMA (Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufactures Association) to provide a mechanism for reasonable assurance that chemical plant operators have a basic understanding of the technology behind a process.  \n\n?    Heico cares not only about safety on our site; we also care about the transportation of materials.  Our continuos improvement effort of Responsible Care? focuses on reducing risks to the environment, employees, and the public as a result of the shipment of chemicals. Heico?s implementation of the code includes significant work with various carriers to qualify them for shipment of our materials.\n\n?    Heico has a very active process safety program as we review our processes on a regular "

HAZOPs review, identify, and rank potential problem areas of a process before they can occur.  Any new process has a HAZOP completed prior to introduction into the manufacturing facility.  Our HAZOP programs provide the basis for continuous improvement of our plant operations and safety.\n\n?    Heico recognizes that it is both environmentally responsible and good business practices to generate less waste and minimize emissions. Heico has been aggressively working on projects to reduce waste generation.  We have a waste minimization policy that requires an annual review of all processes to identify pollution prevention opportunities.  We have a strong commitment to Total Quality Management and consider waste reduction an important part of our quality improvement process.\n"
