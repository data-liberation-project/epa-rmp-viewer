      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the\n\nParachute Creek Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk\n\nManagement Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The\n\nParachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant has also implemented all the elements of Williams Midstream's\n\nSystem Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant's Emergency Response Plan is site-specific. It includes required\n\nactions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and\n\nagencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted\n\nannually.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant processes raw natural gas into pure methane, and other natural\n\ngas liquids. The raw natural gas is received by pipeline. The PCGP is a natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction\n\nfacility designed to process 700 MMSCFD of raw field natural gas. The purpose of the PCGP is to separate\n\nNGL out of the raw field gas thereby producing a residue gas and natural gas condensate liquid.\n\n\n\nTo effect this separation, the inlet field gas is chilled using a propane refrigeration system. This process causes\n\nthe NGL to condense out of the chilled gas stream. As the gas is chilled, ethylene glycol is sprayed/injected intothe field gas to absorb water. Ethylene glycol, NGL, and residue gas are then separated in the cold separator\n\nprocess unit. The remaining gaseous stream is sold as methane residue gas product and leaves the facility via\n\npipeline. The NGL stream is stored onsite in pressurized storage tanks prior to being trucked offsite for sale.\n\nThe ethylene glyco"

The\n\nplant has also implanted all the elements of Williams Midstream's System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains\n\nadditional environmental, health, and safety standards. Key elements of these programs include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of\n\nthe process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure\n\nthat adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: The Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant maintains written procedures that address\n\nvarious modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary\n\noperations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after\n\nturnaround.\n\n\n\nContractors: Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during\n\nperiods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process\n\nequipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe\n\nmanner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an\n\nemergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they\n\nfind during their work.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures,\n\npersonnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into s"

The program includes OJT training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any\n\nnew hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near\n\nmiss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with\n\napplicable RMP / PSM / SIP procedures and regulations.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\n\n\nA release of a regulated substance has occurred in the last 5 years. Equipment failure on a compressor\n\ncreated a methane fire in the compressor building.

      "SummaryText": "\n\n$2,000. Equipment was upgraded to improve the reliability of the system and to reduce the likelyhood of a\n\nreoccurrence.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect\n\nemployees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of\n\nregulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances,\n\nincluding the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency\n\nresponse, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local\n\nemergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these\n\nprocedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on\n\nmodifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered\n\nthrough the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning\n\nPlant is coordinated with Garfield County LEPC. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which\n\nincludes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Parachute Creek Gas\n\nConditioning Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the Garfield County LEPC. The Plant conducts\n\nperiodic emergency drills that involve the Garfield County LEPC and emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Parachute Creek Plant plans to evaluate\n\nadditional engineering safeguards and continue training of employees and contractors. These additional\n\nsafeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulates substances."
