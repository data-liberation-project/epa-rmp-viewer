Edgar, NE\nSuperior Deshler, Inc. receives, stores and distributes Anhydrous Ammonia at the facility located in Edgar Nebraska.  The maximum storage quanity of Anhydrous is 140,196 lbs..  The facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III.\nWorst Case Scenario - A maximun of 140,196 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia could be released in a gaseous stte ove a duration of 10 minutes at 14,020 lbs/min into the rural area surrounding the plant up to 1.10 miles to endpoint.  The offsite consequences could include approximately 600 residential people.\nAlternative Relaese Scenario - A transfer hose failure of Anhydrous Ammonia has the potential to release 26,638 lbs. of product in a gaseous state over 2 minutes at a rate of 13,319 lbs/min in the urban area surrounding the plant up to .59 miles.  the offsite consequences could include up to 300 residential people.\nthe owners, management and employees at the facility are prepared to work with local fire departments and other authorities to minimize the impact of any release to the community and the enviornmnet.  The facility has had no such release in teh past 5 years.
