This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving both practices and measures to prevent the release of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, the Silver Creek facility is prepared to work with the Floyd County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to people and the environment.\n\nThe Charles City facility's primary covered process activity is the mixing of fertilizers.  These activities include storage and processing of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and processed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic and usually occurs in the Spring and Fall.  Ammonia mixing with phosphoric acid occurs in a T-reactor. The T reactor is usually a contractor operation that is controlled by the contractor.   Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The Emergency Response Procedures for Charles City are coordinated with the Floyd County LEPC.\n\nUnited Suppliers Inc--Charles City, Ia. facility follows the provisions of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910 111 and 29 CFR 1910 119, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the State  regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\nFive (5) Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage.  Nor to our knowledge, has there been any releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage and/or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Action Plan:  United Suppliers, Inc. ? Charles City, Ia  has a written emergency action plan.  This plan includes notification of the Floyd County LEPC to respond to a major release as United Suppliers, Inc -- Charles City, Ia does not plan on responding to a major relea"
