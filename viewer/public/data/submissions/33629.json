      "SummaryText": "The Greater Hazleton Joint Sewer Authority (GHJSA) owns and operates GHJSA Wastewater Treatment Plant located in Hazleton Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  The service area includes the City of Hazleton, the Borough of West Hazleton, and portions of Hazle Township.  The wastewater treatment plant, located at Jaycee Drive at Oscar Thomas Drive in the Valmont Industrial Park, has an annual average design flow of 8.92 million gallons per day (mgd).  The WWTP operates under NPDES Permit No. PA 0026921 and discharges treated effluent to the Black Creek.   Wastewater treatment processes include grit and coarse screenings removal, preliminary sedimentation, secondary bio-towers and activated sludge treatment, clarification, and disinfection.  Solids removed from the treatment process are dewatered and disposed in a landfill.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nThe WWTP includes a Chlorinator Building, which contains three (3) one ton containers of chlorine (liquefied under pressure), four (4) chlorinators, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  The chlorinator system extracts chlorine gas from the storage cylinders through high pressure regulators and dissolves this gas into water to form a disinfection solution that is used to kill pathogenic bacteria in treated wastewater prior to its discharge into the creek.  Up to eight (8) one ton cylinders may be stored outside in cradles on a raised pad adjacent to the Chlorinator Building.  Plant operators regularly check the building and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the rate as necessary.  Accounting for administrative controls on inventory, the maximum intended inventory is 16,000 pounds.  \u00bfWastewater treatment\u00bf is not an industry classification listed in Section 40 CFR 68.10(d), nor are municipal wastewater treatment plants regulated under OSHA PSM in Pennsylvania.

      "SummaryText": "r, the proximity to residential and commercial districts warrants that the facility be classified as a Program 2 Facility.\n\nThe Greater Hazleton Joint Sewer Authority's WWTP accidental release prevention program is based upon the following elements:\n\n1.\tHigh level of training for the operators;\n2.\tPreventative maintenance program for equipment;\n3.\tUse of standard process and safety equipment;\n4.\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators;\n5.\tPerformance of a hazard review of the equipment and procedures; and\n6.\tImplementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA,) worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine supply, awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chlorine gas detector.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program which has been reviewed and coordinated by the Luzerne County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Wilkes Barre and by the West Hazleton Fire Department and its HAZMAT Response Team.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills have been conducted with the fire company, and the operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated on a regular basis."
