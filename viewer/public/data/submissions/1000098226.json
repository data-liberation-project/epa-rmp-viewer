The Facility Policy\n\nThe owner, management, and employees of S&S Agri Services Inc. are committed to the\n\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur,\n\nthe facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any\n\nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia\n\nis used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 272,000 lbs. in two 30,000 gallon storage tanks\n\nand nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding\n\n40,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case release scenario however it has been\n\nwithheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"\"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling\n\nof Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\"\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and\n\nthe Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR\n\n1910.111, \"\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"\". In addition, North Dakota Department\n\nof Ag rules are followed.\n\n\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have\n\ncaused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have\n\nresulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacu"

Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to\n\nassess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\n\nsafety recommendations for implementation at this time."
