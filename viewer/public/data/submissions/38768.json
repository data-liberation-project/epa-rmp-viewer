Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during its use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and the environment.\n\nIt is our policy at Gorton's to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program by managing and operating this facility in compliance with the applicable federal and state regulations.  The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia.  Our plant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety devices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\nFive Year Update\n\nThis RMP was originally developed by PSM Inc. on behalf of Gorton's specifically to prevent and mitigate accidental releases associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.  Tighe & Bond has performed the requisite regulatory update necessary for covered facilities on their five year RMP submission anniversary.  This included performance of an off site consequence analysis (OCA) taking into account data revised from the year 2000 census.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled.\n\nGorton's, 127 Rogers Street, Gloucester, Massachusetts operates a refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant.  Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment.  The refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation, compression, condens"

      "SummaryText": "ation and expansion.  Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant.  Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy.  The refrigeration cycle is a closed loop process.  The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and latent heat of vaporization for cooling.  The refrigeration system uses this phenomenon to remove heat from a desired space, and then to discard that heat through condensation, to an area where it is of no consequence.\n\nGorton's facility adjoins an Americold Cold Storage facility that receives finished product from Gorton's.  The refrigeration system is actually a split system that is partially operated by Americold.  Americold operates the machine room (compressors, condenser, receivers), while Gorton's operates and maintains a portion of the low pressure side of the system (pump receivers, coil evaporators, water chillers and coolers) to maintain processing and freezer temperatures required for the processing and storage of our product.  There are approximately 400 employees at the Gorton's facility, including hourly and salary personnel that manufacture and prepare shipment of frozen seafood products via truck approximately 24 hours a day, five days a week.\n\nAggregate ammonia storage, incorporating both Gorton's and Americold's systems is 40,000 pounds.  The total ammonia charge for Gorton's portion of the refrigeration system (covered process) is approximately 14,000 pounds.  The potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n\nAlthough ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, its dominant characteristic is its pungent, distinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks.  Risks f"

      "SummaryText": "rom accidental exposure to low concentrations of ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat.  The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  Ammonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn, but only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nA worst case release scenario and alternative release scenario were performed and documented in the original RMP filing.  These scenarios were recalculated for the five year anniversary updating population and receptor information.\n\nBased on guidelines provided by EPA in the 2004 RMP Submit Instruction Manual, release scenario information is not provided in this Executive Summary.\n\nAdministrative and Engineering Controls\n\nThe following administrative and engineering controls are in place at Gorton's.  These controls are designed to eliminate, or reduce the possibilities of an accidental release from the refrigeration system.\n\n* Electronic ammonia detection is installed in the chiller room on the first floor.  The alarm system activates a local visual and audible alarm to alert plant personnel of the potential ammonia leak in the monitored area.  The detection system is monitored 24 hours a day.  The security company monitoring system will alert proper personnel in the event of a detection.\n\n* High liquid level switches are configured to pump recirculators.  The high level switches will shut down associated compressor operation during a high level condition.\n\n* All compressors (Americold monitored) are configured with critical safety controls (high pressure, low pressure, high oil temp cut-outs, etc.) to shut down the respective compressor in the event of an abnormal operating condition.\n\n* Safety Relief Valves are configured to all pressure vessels, condensers and compressor oil separators to eliminate over pressurization conditions in those associated pieces"

Weekly rounds are made by plant personnel to verify proper equipment operation.\n\n* Security personnel are on premises 24 hours a day, seven days a week to monitor facility access as well as make rounds to detect malfunctions within the refrigeration equipment.\n\nFive-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at Gorton's in the five (5) years preceding the submission of this RMP.\n\nEmergency Action Program\n\nThe purpose of Gorton's Emergency Action Plan is to:\n\n* Minimize exposure to our employees and the surrounding community in the event of a hazardous material release or spill.\n\n* Assure the safe emergency evacuation of the plant in the instance that it is required.\n\n* Provide for prompt medical attention to any employees who become seriously injured or ill at work.\n\n* Facility management has developed an Emergency Response Plan to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan currently meets requirements as set forth in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, Employee Emergency and Fire Prevention Plans.\n\n\n\nJ:\\W\\W3245\\GORTON.doc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
