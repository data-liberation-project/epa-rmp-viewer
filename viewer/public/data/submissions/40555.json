The RMP incorporates the release prevention, emergency response, and training provisions of both the owner and operator, since these two entities coordinate implementation of on-site procedures to ensure that employees are properly prepared to prevent and respond to emergencies.\n\n2.0   Stationary Source Description\n\nThis source is a 4.5 million gallons per day municipal utility district water treatment (water supply) plant that provides potable water for the River Place Subdivision. One of the components of the treatment plant is disinfection of the water by chlorination.  This site is located in an area where the terrain consists of relatively steep hills.\n\n3.0   Regulated Substances\n\nThe only regulated substance present at this facility is chlorine gas, which is delivered in one ton cylinders.\n\n4.0  Release Scenarios \n \nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance was used to determine worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The model RMP*Comp Version 1.07 was used with default weather conditions for worst case and neutral conditions.\n\n5.0   Accidental Release Administrative Controls and Mitigative Measures\n\nThe site is subject to the requirements of OSHA 1910.120 and 1910.138 and qualifies as a Program 3 Risk Management Plan submittal.  It is the policy of the MUD and ECO Resources, Inc. to fully comply with OSHA and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations regarding the storage and use of hazardous materials.\n\nNo engineered passive controls are in place for a chlorine release from this site.  The chlorine transfer and feed stem will only operate under a vacuum.  If the vacuum is broken (due to a line break or leak), the valve at the chlorine storage cylinder automatically closes to prevent a release.  There ar"

ECO Resources, Inc. has emergency equipment and a leak repair kit.  A self-contained breathing apparatus is kept at the facility for use by personnel responding to a leak.  There are emergency procedures in place for stopping leaks and for notification of local authorities and emergency response teams. \n\n6.0   Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases at this site resulting in injuries or property damage.\n\n7.0   Emergency Response Program\n\nUpon discovery of a leak by an employee or local resident report or via the chlorine gas monitor/alarm system, ECO Resources, Inc. notifies the local chlorine response team and the facility operator.  On-site response time is 30 minutes or less.  If the response team determines that 10 pounds of chlorine have been released, or if there is a potential health or off-site health threat, the proper authorities are notified immediately.  The response team will also take immediate steps to shutdown the system and stop/repair the source of the release.\n\n8.0   Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes to improve the safety of this site are currently pending or being implemented.  There are no recommended changes at this time."
