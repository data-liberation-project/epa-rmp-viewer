NECCO makes all necessary information available to those persons responsible for compiling process safety information and those assisting in the development of the process hazard analysis. \r\n\r\nE.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2012, at approximately 10:30 PM, a release of approximately 8,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia occurred at NECCO.  The release occurred as a result of a fire that affected components of the facility air drying system.  RECCO (NECCO's ammonia refrigeration maintenance company) and the Revere Fire Department Emergency Team assisted in the response.  During the incident, the fire department put up a protective fog of water to reduce exposure to those working in the area and monitored ammonia levels in the neighborhood around NECCO to ensure the safety of the public.  The direct cause of the incident is still being investigated.\r\n\r\nF.\tEmergency Response Procedures and Policies\r\n\r\nNECCO has elected to develop an emergency action plan rather than a full-fledged emergency response plan.   In the event that an accidental release occurs the plant depends on the Revere Fire and Police Departments for outside support.  When the Revere Fire Department determines additional assistance is needed, NECCO will contact other local and state emergency response teams or an emergency response contractor.  Revere, Massachusetts is part of the Mystic Regional Emergency Response Committee. \r\n\r\nG.\tPlanned Changes\r\n\r\nAlthough NECCO plans to incorporate certain procedural changes into their RMP/PSM program, there are no planned changes to the ammonia system."

At a minimum, the plant and equipment meet government and industry design and construction standards.\r\n\t\r\nB. \tRMP Covered Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe New England Confectionery Company facility in Revere, Massachusetts is owned by American Capital and operated by NECCO.  The plant manufactures chocolate and nonchocolate confectioneries.  Ammonia is the only chemical present at the plant in sufficient quantity to be regulated by the RMP rule.  Ammonia is used in the refrigeration system used to manufacture confectionery products.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is stored in vessels, piping, and ancillary equipment at the NECCO facility.  The largest vessel, which is the high pressure receiver, can hold approximately 9,126 pounds of ammonia.  The total maximum amount of ammonia used at any one time in the refrigeration process is approximately 36,000 pounds.\r\nC.\tOff-Site Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nAs required by the RMP rule, NECCO's off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release and an alternative release for the covered chemical, ammonia.  In completing the off-site consequence analysis, NECCO used the RMP*Comp model, which was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA to perform the worst-case and alternative release calculations.\r\n\r\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in \u00a7 68.22."

NECCO investigates each incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical in the workplace.  An incident investigation team is established and consists of at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. \r\n\r\n12. Emergency Planning and Response.  NECCO employees do not respond to accidental releases.

      "SummaryText": "EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind which would not disperse a release very effectively.  For toxic gases liquefied under pressure, the worst-case release must assume the entire content of the largest vessel is released in ten minutes.  At NECCO, the largest vessel is the high pressure receiver (9,126 pounds).  NECCO's high pressure receiver is located inside the ammonia room, which is provided with continuous low level ventilation and emergency ventilation that engages upon high ammonia level in the ammonia room.  Based on this design, no mitigation is assumed in the event of catastrophic failure.\r\n\r\nUsing the EPA mandated criteria described above, the worst-case release at the plant (for purposes of RMP) would involve a complete failure of the high pressure receiver, filled to maximum capacity with 9,126 pounds of ammonia.  However, prior RMP submissions assumed a worst-case release of 25,300 pounds of ammonia.  Therefore, for conservatism and consistency with prior RMP submissions, this 2018 RMP update assumes a worst-case release of 25,300 pounds.  If such a release occurred, it would result in a vapor cloud that could impact persons outside of the plant's property line.  The probability of the high pressure receiver releasing its entire contents in ten minutes in Massachusetts on a 77\u00b0F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour is extremely low.\r\n\r\nNECCO also developed an alternative release of ammonia that focuses on a more realistic release scenario occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  EPA requires modeling of a release that could impact off-site locations.  Alternative release modeling of the most realistic scenario resulted in off-site impacts.  After considerin"

      "SummaryText": "g all criteria in the RMP rule, the Process Hazard Analysis performed on the refrigeration process, and all past releases, NECCO used a gas release from a solenoid valve on the facility roof for its alternative release.  The rupture is assumed to result in 100 pounds of ammonia released over a sixty-minute period.  More realistic meteorological conditions were used to generate a more realistic toxic endpoint distance.\r\n\r\nD.\tAccident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nNECCO has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed to drastically reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.   The program complies with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule found at 29 C.F.R. \u00a71910.119 and analogous to RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.  The basic elements of NECCO's prevention program are described below: \r\n\r\n1.\tEmployee Participation.  NECCO has developed a written plan of action regarding employee participation in the safety and accident prevention process.  The plan describes how employees are:  (A)  consulted and what input they will have in the development of process hazard analysis (PHA) and other PSM and RMP safety elements; and (B) given access to PSM and RMP information at the plant.   \r\n\r\n2.\tProcess Safety Information.  NECCO has compiled written process safety information which helped identify the hazards posed by ammonia, handling of materials, management, storage activities and the refrigeration process in general.  The compilation of process safety information provided the foundation for understanding the hazards involved in the refrigeration process and was crucial to the development of the PHA.  The required process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazardous chemicals (e.g. ammonia), the technology of the process, and the process equipment.    \r\n\r\n3.\tProcess Hazard Analyses.  NECCO performed its most recent process hazard analysis (PHA) on the refrigeration"

As part of this commitment, NECCO has developed and implemented numerous safety programs that are designed to eliminate and/or drastically reduce the potential for accidental releases.  NECCO has also developed and implemented a number of programs that are designed to ensure that, if an accidental release occurs, it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to people, the environment and the plant.  Many of these programs have been in place for some time. \r\n\r\nNECCO views accident prevention, and personnel and environmental protection, as an ongoing process.  Consequently, NECCO continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection, and emergency response programs.  One element of NECCO's overall accident prevention and response program is its Risk Management Program.  NECCO's Risk Management Program (RMP) complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One of the requirements of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan, which provides the public with information about NECCO's processes, accident prevention programs, and emergency response planning efforts.  NECCO's compliance with EPA's RMP rule includes:\r\n\r\n1.\tCompletion of a hazard assessment in compliance with 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart B, including the five-year accidental release history.   \r\n2.\tImplementation of an accident prevention program.  The plant's RMP accident prevention program is coordinated with the plant's Process"

      "SummaryText": "system in March 2013.  The PHA is a key component of the PSM system and NECCO's RMP accident prevention program.  It provided a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling hazards posed by the refrigeration process.  The PHA utilized methodologies in accordance with 29 C.F.R. \u00a71910.119(e) and 40 C.F.R. \u00a768.67.  \r\n\r\n4.\tOperating Procedures. NECCO has developed written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the refrigeration process.  These procedures are consistent with the process safety information described in subtask 2, above.\r\n \r\nNECCO has also developed safe work practices that provide for the control of hazards during operations.  For example, NECCO has programs that govern the following activities:  lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into PSM and RMP covered portions of the plant by maintenance, contractor or other support personnel.\r\n\r\n5.  Training.  NECCO will provide employees, contractors and visitors with training that focuses on the special safety and health hazards posed by the plant operations and safe work practices applicable to the employees job tasks. \r\n\r\n6. Contractors.  As part of NECCO's contractor selection process NECCO will obtain and evaluate information regarding contract employer's safety performance and programs. NECCO will also: \r\n\r\nA.\tInform contract employers of the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractor's work and the covered process;\r\nB.\tExplain to contract employers the applicable provisions of the facility's emergency response contingency plan (discussed below); and\r\nC.\tDevelop safe work practices to control the entrance, presence and exit of contract employers and contract employees in covered process areas.\r\n\r\n7.\tPre-startup Safety Review.
