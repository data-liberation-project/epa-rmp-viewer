In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. \n\nGreenway's Corporate Mission states To provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public. In order to fulfill this mission, Greenway provides a corporatesafety director to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures.  Safety  supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company. \n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal state and local regulations are covered. The safety director conducts comprehensive annual audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. The safety director requires a timely written response with the completion date of all recommendations resulting from the audits.\n\n \nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n This facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center.

Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. Ammonia is used for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n \nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in one stationary storage tank @ 12,000 gallons on site.  56,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks.  The total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is  56,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 56,000 pounds.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nGreenway has developed a worst case scenario; however, it has been withheld as security sensitive material as requested by the EPA.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nGreenway has developed an alternative release scenario; however, it has been withheld as security sensitive material as requested by the EPA.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenev"

The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n There has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release. This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, Greenway has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200). The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.:\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site. We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
