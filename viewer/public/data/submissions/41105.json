The management and employees of the Lovington \nfacility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  If an \naccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other \nauthorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the \nenvironment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of anhydrous hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen \nchloride is received and stored in a rail tank car that contains 149,000 pounds of refrigerated anhydrous \nhydrogen chloride.  The hydrogen chloride is then distributed into various DOT containers such as tube \ntrailers and cylinders.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release, and the  alternative release, or more probable, scenario were determined using the EPA?s Guidelines.  Endpoints were calculated using RMP*Comp ver 1.07 and affected populations were determined using ?Land View V? which is based on the 2000 US Census data.  \n\nThe Off site consequcence analysis and other related information may be reviewed  by contacting the facility.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release \nitself. These include check valves in the fill lines, Excess Flow Valves and Emergency Shut-off Valves,  a \npreventive maintenance schedule for the system, safeties and scrubber systems.\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of\n hydrogen chloride.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, \nadministrative controls and active employee participation.

They are frequently consulted concerning \nthe various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the hydrogen chloride system to enable managers, \nsupervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized \nto develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making \ndecisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of hydrogen chloride. The PHA \nfocuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and \nexternal factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the \nprocess. The PHA was review and updated in May 2001 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating \nconditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The \nprocedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and \npersonnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in \nSeptember 2004 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets \nand exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA?s hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  \nTraining includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), \nspecial assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and \nnonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.

The employees  are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and \nknowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed in \nSeptember 2004.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or \nused can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and \nthe public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, \nincluding injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job \nskills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors \nsafety procedures were last review in September 2004.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and \nconstruction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.
