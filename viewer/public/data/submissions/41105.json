If an \naccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other \nauthorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the \nenvironment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of anhydrous hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen \nchloride is received and stored in a rail tank car that contains 149,000 pounds of refrigerated anhydrous \nhydrogen chloride.  The hydrogen chloride is then distributed into various DOT containers such as tube \ntrailers and cylinders.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release, and the  alternative release, or more probable, scenario were determined using the EPA\u00bfs Guidelines.  Endpoints were calculated using RMP*Comp ver 1.07 and affected populations were determined using \u00bfLand View V\u00bf which is based on the 2000 US Census data.  \n\nThe Off site consequcence analysis and other related information may be reviewed  by contacting the facility.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release \nitself.

This information was utilized \nto develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making \ndecisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of hydrogen chloride. The PHA \nfocuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and \nexternal factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the \nprocess. The PHA was review and updated in May 2001 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating \nconditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The \nprocedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and \npersonnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in \nSeptember 2004 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.
