Aside from the Hypochlorite solution, other supporting chemicals had to be used. The change would have additionally required major construction to our facility and the procurement and installation of additional reaction vessels. This would have necessitated the initiation of a Military Construction (MILCON) request. If granted the MILCON would, in and of itself, have been cost prohibitive without factoring in the additional cost of the reaction vessels, addition chemicals, and increased manpower to operate the new process. For these reasons the change was deemed not feasible at this time. NAWS China Lake continues to watch for alternative technologies and processes for its wastewater treatment system."
