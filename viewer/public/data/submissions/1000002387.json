AmericoldA\u00bfs senior management is not only committed to offer a superior service but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  AmericoldA\u00bfs safety and environmental policies are administered by the Regional Safety Manager and Regional Director of Engineering.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Americold - Blue Mound Road facility is located at 4900 Blue Mound Road.  The facility is situated in a rural area approximately 1 mile south of Interstate 820.   The High Pressure Receiver, Evaporative Condensers, and Evaporator valve stations are located outside and all of the remaining ammonia equipment is located inside.  The facility was constructed in 1994.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of Americold - Blue Mound Road is to provide cooler and freezer warehousing space.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 11,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the warehouse evaporators.  Typical operating conditions range from 3 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 161 psig on the high side of the system.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the ammonia re"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Americold - Blue Mound Road to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Americold - Blue Mound Road's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Operators perform inspections of the engine room four time"

Additionally, critical process parameters are continuously monitored by an external alarm company which will alert operators in the event of an abnormal situation.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nBased upon the Americold - Blue Mound Road Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (05/19/2004), there have not been any reportable releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (May 2004-May 2009.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\nA\u00bf save lives;\r\nA\u00bf minimize and avoid injuries;\r\nA\u00bf protect the environment; and\r\nA\u00bf minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility as well as detailing the training, procedures, and members of the Emergency Response Team.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nIn June 1999, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, a Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analysis Study was performed in April 2009.  The 2009 PHA Revalidation consisted of:\r\n\r\nA\u00bf a detailed review of the What-if log tables from the previous study;\r\nA\u00bf a series of safety checklists\r\nA\u00bf a hazard and operability study; and\r\nA\u00bf a facility inspection.\r\n\r\nThe mitigation measures include the addition of ammonia sensors, exhaust fans, and enhanced operating procedures.  All recommendations resulting from the revalidation study are due to be completed by June 2005"
