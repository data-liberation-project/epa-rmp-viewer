Unified Pet Products will utilize its Risk Management Program to identify ways to reduce its use of hazardous materials and minimize potential risks to its employees, the community, and environment.  Unified Pet Products will comply with applicable safety, health, and environmental regulations; identify, report, and promptly correct unsafe conditions; train personnel to safely perform their job duties; and work to maintain a safe workplace.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Substance Handled\r\nUnified Pet Products has implemented a Level 3 Risk Management Program to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from its plant at 126 W Grant Street in West Point, Nebraska. At this location, Unified Pet Products processes and packages pet treats for distribution to domestic companies. The industrial process relies on chillers to keep the food products cold during preparation, packaging and storage. The chillers and refrigeration system use anhydrous ammonia as the coolant in quantities exceeding EPA's regulatory threshold.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nUnified Pet Products relies on several safeguards as part of its accidental release prevention program. Unified Pet Product's engineers and vendors use recognized design codes and standards for the equipment and system components that are installed; standard operating procedures specify safe practices used at the plant; a maintenance program establishes proper testing, maintenance, and cleaning procedures. Also hazard communication occurs frequently between management, operators, and employees during the process hazard analysis, process safety information reviews, training, and safety briefings.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History \r\nThe facility will restart operations in 2"

The facility has not been operational within the last 5 years, and no accidental releases of ammonia have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage, offsite.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response \r\nUnified Pet Products has an emergency response program in place which outlines the actions to be taken for emergency notification of the facility's neighbors, a facility evacuation, ammonia release, or natural disaster. The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Cuming County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the West Point Fire Department and it provides guidance for the notification, response and evacuation of Unified Pet Product's employees. The emergency action plan acknowledges the LEPC as the emergency coordinators and the Norfolk Fire Department as the first responders.\r\n\t\r\nSafety Improvements \r\nUnified Pet Product's regular participation in safety training and internal facility safety reviews. Will host the Norfolk Fire Department during facility walk through, receives annual insurance carrier facility safety inspections, conducts audits to identify potential improvements, conducts regular pipe integrity testing, and offers Unified Pet Product employees awareness level, initial and refresher training on the ammonia refrigeration system. This Risk Management Plan and information used to prepare it are readily available to all Unified Pet Product employees."
