The facility has two interconnected refrigeration systems which contain anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance under the RMP regulations.\n\nThe location has prepared a worst case release scenario, with distance to the toxic endpoint, using the ALOHA air dispersion modeling software. The alternate case release scenario, with distance to the toxic endpoint, was prepared using the RMPComp software. \n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility\u00c2\u00bfs ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administration controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.  \n\nIn the five years preceding the re-submittal of this RMP, this facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths,"

The facility is included in the LEPC\u00c2\u00bfs community emergency response plan. \n\nThe process hazard analysis reports prepared for the facility in August 2004 identified various recommendations to minimize the risk of accidental releases and improve safety related to the ammonia refrigeration system.  All of the recommendations from the 2004 PHA have been resolved."
