Forest Agronomy\n6472 N Forest Ave\nForest, IN  46039\n\nFor further information contact:  David Robertson (Location Manager) Phone:  (765) 249-2251\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of AgMax, Inc. Forest Agronomy are committted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     The primary activity at AgMax, Inc. Forest Agronomy is the storage and blending of fertilizers for custom application and sale to farmers.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 428,550 pounds in our 26,000 gallon, 12,000 gallon, and 6,000 gallon storage tanks and 48 wagon type nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our 26,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 113,800 pounds, which is the volume of our storage tank when filled to 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .98 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternative release scenario based on five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a 3 inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .59 miles.\n\n4.  The accident release prevention program.\n\n     AgMax, Inc. Forest Agronomy has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the S"

The Five-year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; mor\n\n-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThis facility has:\n\n     a.  A written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n     c.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is and on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
