The Emergency Response Team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n\n\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Plant.  The Emergency Response Plan addresses numerous topics including: Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies; Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority; Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention; Safe Distances and Places of Refuge; Site Security and Control; Evacuation Routes and Procedures; Decontamination Procedures; provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment; Emergency Notification Procedures; Chemical Response Procedures; Post Incident Critique; and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment.\n\n\n\nResponse and hazardous materials training is provided at the Plant and all training activities are designed to meet training requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) (7) and (8).  All Plant Emergency Response Team members are trained 24 hours initially to the Technician level followed by 8-24 hours of refresher training per year under the direction of the on-site Hazmat Instructor at the facility. Each Instructor receives an initial 40 hours of training and 8-16 hours per year re-certification training that goes to I.C. level. The training is designed to teach both theory and hands-on training giving the person an overall understanding of the nature of hazardous materials and the ability to assess and safely respond to the incidents in the Incident Command structure.  Technician level training includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n\n\n-Knowledge of basic hazards and risk assessment techniques\n\n-Proper selection and use of appropriate and required ppe for the chemical hazard\n\n-Terminology associated with hazardous materials\n\n-Advanced site control/security procedures\n\n-Advanced containment/control/decontamination procedures\n\n-Use of atmospheric monit"
