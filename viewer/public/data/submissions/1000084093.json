In order to reduce NOx air emissions, Sammis installed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system on units 6&7 back in 2009.  This system removes NOx by catalytically reacting NOx with Ammonia to form Nitrogen and water vapor.  The process is covered by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rules due to the presence of 29 % Aqueous Ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe covered process includes:  rail car unloading, tank truck unloading, storage, and SCR feed.  There are six storage tanks that may contain up to 54,000 gallons each (90% capacity).  There is also an emergency truck unloading and feed station.\r\n\r\nOverview of the RMP Prevention Program \r\nThe Sammis process is considered a Program 2 site by RMP rules.  \r\n\r\nProcess protections are primarily those measures that will reduce, prevent or minimize a release from happening or, if it did happen, minimize the consequences of that threat.    These include:\r\n\r\nTraining on operations, emergencies etc;\r\nOperators of the systems covered by the RMP plan have refresher training at least every 3 years.\r\nRegular maintenance/SOPS;        \r\nDuring deliveries, attendance by the operator is continuous until the delivery is complete;\r\nNo rail cars or tank trucks stored on site other than those in the process of being unloaded;\r\nOnsite wireless communication;\r\nOnsite trucks/vehicles for emergency transportation needs;   \r\nFire extinguishers; \r\nAmmonia monitors/detectors/alarms;\r\nMain feed pump flow alarms/detector\r\nHigh level tank alarms with interlock shutoffs  \r\nSecondary containment;         \r\nUnderground vault large enough to contain the largest release and hence minimize air releases.\r\nStorage tank design and inspections;\r\nTemperature/pressure indicators;\r\nWater cannon and service water hydrants (knock down Ammonia fumes);\r\nIncident investigation procedures; \r\n\r\nThese are the major site securi"
