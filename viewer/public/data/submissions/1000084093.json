      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nFirstEnergy Sammis Plant\n\nRMP Plan\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nEnergy Harbor generates electricity at the Sammis power plant in Stratton, Ohio.  In order to reduce NOx air emissions, Sammis installed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system on units 6&7 back in 2009.  This system removes NOx by catalytically reacting NOx with Ammonia to form Nitrogen and water vapor.  The process is covered by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rules due to the presence of 29 % Aqueous Ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe covered process includes:  rail car unloading, tank truck unloading, storage, and SCR feed.  There are six storage tanks that may contain up to 54,000 gallons each (90% capacity).  There is also an emergency truck unloading and feed station.\n\n\n\nOverview of the RMP Prevention Program \n\nThe Sammis process is considered a Program 2 site by RMP rules.  \n\n\n\nProcess protections are primarily those measures that will reduce, prevent or minimize a release from happening or, if it did happen, minimize the consequences of that threat.    These include:\n\n\n\nTraining on operations, emergencies etc;\n\nOperators of the systems covered by the RMP plan have refresher training at least every 3 years.\n\nRegular maintenance/SOPS;        \n\nDuring deliveries, attendance by the operator is continuous until the delivery is complete;\n\nNo rail cars or tank trucks stored on site other than those in the process of being unloaded;\n\nOnsite wireless communication;\n\nOnsite trucks/vehicles for emergency transportation needs;   \n\nFire extinguishers; \n\nAmmonia monitors/detectors/alarms;\n\nMain feed pump flow alarms/detector\n\nHigh level tank alarms with interlock shutoffs  \n\nSecondary containment;         \n\nUnderground vault large enough to contain the largest release and hence minimize air releases.\n\nStorage tank design and inspections;\n\nTemperature/pressure indicators;\n\nWater cannon and service water hydrants (knock down Ammonia fumes);\n\nIncident investigation procedures; \n\n\n\nThese are the major site securi"

Selected site response personnel are Hazwoper trained.    \n\n\n\nEmergency response planning has long been an integral part of operations at Sammis.  Regulations under OSHA, EPA, Coast Guard, and Ohio EPA have required the site to develop and implement procedures to plan for and respond to emergency situations at the plant whether due to natural disasters, storms, exposure to releases or harm/damage resulting from potentially flammable or explosive materials.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn response to the 5 year RMP review and revalidation, the following action items are planned to be conducted by Energy Harbor.\n\nNode Aqueous Ammonia Storage - PRV's should be inspected and tested in accordance with\n\nguidelines set forth in B31.3.\n\nNode Truck Unloading Station (Emergency Scenarios) - Provide portable Secondary Containment\n\nfor Truck unloading during process.\n\nEmergency Response Plan - Emergency Response Plan will be updated to reflect current contact\n\ninformation of plant staff.\n\n\n\n \n\nDescription of Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\n\n#1.
