We use a combination of programs for accidental release prevention and emergency response planning to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* A summary of planned changes to improve safety at the facility\n* The certifications required by EPA's RMP rule\n\n2.0     STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces nuclear fuel assemblies, consisting of uranium dioxide pellets, using a variety of chemicals and processes.  We convert uranium dioxide powder from uranium hexafluoride using steam and dissociated ammonia.  Ammonia dissociation creates nitrogen and hydrogen gas.  Uranium dioxide powder is pressed into pellets, then is fired to a ceramic in electrically heated furnaces having a dissociated ammonia atmosphere.  Uranium-bearing scrap is also recycled through furnaces having an ammonia atmosphere.  These processes use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n* Hazardous Material - Ammonia (NH3)\n* Maximum Inventory - 62,100 lbs.\n* Use At Facility - "

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n3.1    Worst-Case Release Scenario - Ammonia\n\nThe worst-case scenario involves the complete failure of both storage tanks over a 10-minute time interval.  The combined maximum mass in both tanks is 62,100 pounds, resulting in a release rate of 6,210 pound per minute.  The weather conditions for this scenario are defaults provided by the EPA.  This scenario could result in a downwind exposure endpoint of 2.8 miles.  Public receptors potentially impacted include:\n\n* schools\n* residences\n* commercial areas\n\nThe potentially affected population within a 2.8-mile radius from the tanks is 5,775.  No environmental receptors are impacted.  Administrative controls considered for this scenario are a maximum fill volume of 85% for the 10,000-gallon tank, and 60% full for the 6,000-gallon tank.  No mitigation measures could be considered.\n\n3.2    Alternative Release Scenario - Ammonia\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves 85 pounds emitted over a 1-minute interval from the failure of a hose coupling.  The weather conditions for this scenario are defaults provided by the EPA.  This scenario could result in a downwind exposure endpoint is 0.1 miles.\n\nPublic receptors impacted include:\n\n* State Road P\n\nThere is no potentially affected population or environmental receptor within a 0.1-mile radius from the tanks.  Mitigation measures considered for this scenario w"

That program also provided the default weather conditions for both release scenarios.  The population figures for both scenarios were determined by using Land View III Environmental Mapping Software obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Public and environmental receptors were determined using United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan, and the community emergency response plan, provides reasonable contingencies.\n\n4.0     GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n* Process safety information (i.e. process technology)\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures and safe work practices\n* Training and performance\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Quality assurance\n* Management of change\n* Pre-startup safety review\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation and reporting\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work controls\n* Contractors safety and performance evaluation\n* Emergency planning and response\n\nThese programmatic elements work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business.  We have specific measures to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.0     FIVE- YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  Formal incident investigations are conducted to identify and correct the root causes of such an incident.  There have been no significant accidents or incidents involving ammonia "
