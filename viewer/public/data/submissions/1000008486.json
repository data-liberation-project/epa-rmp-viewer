FHR Marysville is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  The FHR Marysville site maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  FHR Marysville participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  The FHR Marysville site has remained both a safe and quality supplier for over 20 years in Southeastern Michigan as exemplified by our continuing certification to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management process.\n\nFHR's Marysville site is located in the southwestern corner of the City of Marysville, Michigan.  The site includes 58.6 acres, of which 20 acres have been developed.  The Marysville Site utilizes a continuous polymerization operation to convert pipeline-supplied propylene and ethylene into polypropylene pellets which molding companies then process into useful applications such as:  automotive trim, toys, medical containers, appliance parts, and other consumer products.  Propane is produced as a by-product of propylene purification.\n\n2.\tRegulated Substances.\nFHR's Marysville Site has 2 regulated substances at the facility.  The two flammable substances are:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPropylene - Used to produce synthetic polymer resins.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPropane - Used widely for home heating.\n\n3.\tOffsite Consequence Analysis.\nThe RMP Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the envi"

The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  \n\nFHR Marysville used LandView 6, software supplied by the USEPA et al., to estimate the residential population within the distance to endpoint for both the Worst Case Release and Alternative Case Release Scenarios.  FHR Marysville also used knowledge of the surrounding area in estimating affected populations. \n\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. \nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that FHR's Marysville Site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nFHR's Marysville Site is to maintain a compilation of written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is to be a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf The technology of the process:  Is to include a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Equipment in the process:  Is to include such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis\nFHR's Marysville Site has performed process hazard analyses (PHA) on the polypropylene process to identify any potential hazards, the adequacy of the"

The Marysville Site assigns employees to the PHA team who are to be knowledgeable in the PHA methodology and the specific process.  The PHA team is to develop recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are to be implemented within a reasonable period of time.\n \nOperating Procedures\nFHR Marysville is to maintain written operating procedures developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures are to address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures, and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are to be reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \nTraining\nFHR Marysville is to provide initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training is to emphasize safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators are to receive periodic refresher training.\n \nMechanical Integrity\nFHR Marysville is to develop written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is to be comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper functioning of process equipment.\n \nManagement of Change\nFHR Marysville is to establish and implement written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.

Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are to be informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.  \n  \nPre-Startup Review\nFHR Marysville is to perform pre-startup safety reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup safety review is to confirm, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; management-of-change requirements are met; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n \nCompliance Audit\nFHR Marysville is to perform audits to ensure its compliance with the provisions of its process safety management program.  Teams, which are to be comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are to be reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are to be implemented and tracked until resolved.\n\nFHR Marysville has entered the date of its most recent PSM / RMP compliance audit\u00c2\u00bfs closing conference under Section 7.10.a. as the date of the most recent compliance audit.\n  \nIncident Investigation\nFHR Marysville is to investigate any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals"

FHR Marysville has established a system intended to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution.  Finally, incident reports are to be reviewed with all affected personnel.\n \nEmployee Participation\nFHR Marysville is to have developed a written action plan for employee participation in all aspects of its process safety management program.  FHR Marysville is to consult with employees on the conduct and development of PHA's and on the development of other elements of the process safety management program.  FHR Marysville is to ensure that all employees have access to PHA's and all other process safety management information.\n \nHot Work Permit\nFHR Marysville employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations that is to be conducted on or near the covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing operations).  If any hot work is performed near the covered process, FHR Marysville is to issue a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.
