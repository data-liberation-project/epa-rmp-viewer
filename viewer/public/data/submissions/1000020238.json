      "SummaryText": "As a good neighbor, Landmark Services Cooperative is committed to keeping the community safe.  We comply with all Federal and State standards regarding anhydrous ammonia storage.  The Cooperative Plus facility located on 17702 County Line Rd, Union Grove, WI, complies with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.11 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Landmark Services Cooperative has an emergency response procedure for notifying the local fire authority and police department, as well as the Racine LEPC.  The telephone numbers for the previously named public services are posted on an emergency board in plain sight in case of an emergency.  At the facility located in Union Grove, WI, anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed for resale to farmers.  The anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in a 30,000 gallon tank.  Additionally, it is loaded into portable nurse typically about 1,000 gallon capacity.  It is distributed for direct application.  The maximum amount stored at this facility is 430,000 lbs, contained within portable nurse tanks and the 30,000 gallon tank.  Capacity of the 30,000 gallon tank is 130,000 pounds (30,000 times 5.1 lbs per gallon times 85%).  Worst case scenario is a gas release of 130,000 lbs due to a tank rupture.  The anhydrous ammonia would be released as a gas for a 10 minute period at a rate of 13,000 lbs per minute.  Under urban conditions the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles (using the RMP Comp model).  Alternative scenario is a transfer hose failure causing a 5% release of 6,500lbs (3,250 lbs per minute for 2 minutes).   The release being stopped by human interaction.  Under urban conditions the distance to the endpoint is .4 miles.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past that have resulted in any deaths, injuries, or property damage on or off site.   Safety, both for the community and our employees, is an ongoing process at the facility.  Planned periodic maintenance evaluations are done to ensure t"
