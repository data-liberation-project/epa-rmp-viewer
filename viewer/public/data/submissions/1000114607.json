The most recent ammonia-related drill was conducted with the BFD and CNHHMT at Merrimack Station October of 2021. \n \nAccess to the site is restricted to employees and authorized contractors.  Early warning systems include ammonia gas detectors that are strategically placed around the equipment.  \n\nF. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nGSP is committed to providing a safe work environment.  The following items will be initiated as part of the ongoing program to ensure safety:\n\n- Continue to provide annual refresher training to Hazardous Waste Operator/ Emergency Response personnel \n- Review and update current contractor training program\n- Perform non-destructive examination (NDE) on the ammonia storage tanks following a regular schedule\n- Implement the recommendations from the December 2022 Process Safety Management Audit and the upcoming Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation in July 2024."

The ammonia systems were designed and constructed with ANSI K61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia guidance.  The storage tanks are built to the ASME Pressure Vessel Code for Unfired Vessels.\n\nGSP's accident prevention program is based on the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan which is a 13 point program for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases.  The Plan includes: routine maintenance and inspections, operating procedures, employee training in the hazards and handling of ammonia, and provides for periodic program audits.\n \nAll employees who operate ammonia equipment are trained in the hazards of ammonia.  Shift operators conduct rounds that include observations of the ammonia systems.  Trouble reports are submitted when action is required and qualified mechanics are on site to make repairs.  Pressure vessels are inspected according to the ASME.  A management of change process is followed for qualifying modifications to the covered processes.\n\nD. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n \nMerrimack Station went into commercial operation in 1960.  The first use of anhydrous ammonia on site was in 1991.  There have been no reportable releases of ammonia or related impacts from the use of ammonia to the health and safety of employees or the surrounding community.\n\nE. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n \nA written Emergency Response Plan is included as part of the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) and provides guidance to employees in the event of any emergency at the station.  The primary contact during any emergency is the on-duty working foreman operations (WFO) who is available on site 24/7 at 603-230-7901 & 603-230-7902.  There are 4 WFO's who work on rotating shifts (Michael Poirer, Chris Finn, John Lovett, and Bob King as of May 2024).  The ICP includes procedures for notifying the local response agencies.

The station maintains an Emergency Response Plan as part of an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that will be activated in the event of an emergency involving a regulated substance.  Merrimack Station is included in the local emergency response plan and the ICP is provided to the following external entities: Bow Fire Department, Central New Hampshire Hazmat Team, Concord Hospital, Bow Police Department, Bow Emergency Management Department, and the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. \n\nB. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n \nMerrimack Station is a fossil fueled electric power generating facility owned and operated by GSP Merrimack LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Granite Shore Power, LLC. \n\nThe purpose of this facility is to generate electric power for sale via transmission and distribution lines.  There are four separate units with a net claimed capacity of 438 megawatts.  Units 1 & 2 use coal fired cyclone boilers to produce steam that powers turbine driven generators capable of 108 and 330 megawatts respectively.  Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) form during the combustion process.\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction deNOx Technology (SCR) was installed in 1995 on Unit 2 and in 1999 on Unit 1 to remove emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) as part of the plan to comply with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  The application of SCR reduces NOx air emissions from the station in excess of 80%.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the reagent used in the process.  Ammonia vapor is added to the flue gas ahead of the catalyst bed where it combines with the NOx to form nitrogen gas and water vapor.\n\nC.
