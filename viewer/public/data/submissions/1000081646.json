The site follows the philosophy Commitment to ZERO, which constantly strives for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  Site programs, procedures and management practices are in place to support our organizations commitment.  Progress is constantly assessed against our commitment and corrective actions are taken whenever necessary.  Although the primary focus of the facility is on accidental release prevention, the site also possesses and maintains strong emergency response capabilities to back-up prevention activities.  The combination of prevention programs and emergency response capabilities is used to ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as, the protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) Risk Management Program    regulation;\r\n\u00bf\tA summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases;\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of our Emergency Response program;\r\n\u00bf\tA five-year history of accidental release of chemicals regulated by the TCPA rule;\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees,    the public, and the environment.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Chambers Works facility first opened in the early 1900s as a dye manufacturing plant.

They are able to respond to any chemical release to mitigate the impact.   The site is committed to maintaining strong emergency response capabilities to back-up our prevention activities.  The Emergency Response brigade is comprised of both Chemours and DuPont employees and are specially trained operators that can respond in the event of an onsite chemical release. The Emergency Response team is thoroughly trained, properly equipped and staffed 24 hours a day.  Chambers Works conducts practice drills with the local community and emergency response organizations.  These drills simulate potential accidental release and test emergency response plans.  Chambers Works also supports a siren system in the local community that would provide early warning for a potential release.  This system is coordinated with the Salem County Office of Emergency Response. In addition to on-site activities, Chambers works maintains transportation emergency response capability, which allows the site to respond to chemical transportation incidents outside the Chambers Works site.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no incidents in the past 5 years that meet the Risk Management Plan reporting criteria.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAs part of our process hazards review procedures, all of our processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction oppo"
