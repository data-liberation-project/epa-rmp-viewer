Messer GmbH has developed Safety, Health, and Environmental guidelines. These guidelines have been further refined and developed into a comprehensive program defined as Loss Prevention Policies (LPP) and are contained in this manual. These policies are the minimal standards for Messer America's (Central, North, South America and AGS) operations.\n\n The objective of this program is to achieve an acceptable level of performance in the prevention of losses to the organization, which include but are not limited to; accidents, injuries, illnesses, product liabilities, regulatory non-conformities, etc. To be effective, this management system must be totally integrated in which all levels of employment are involved and held accountable. \n\nThe ultimate authority for instituting an effective Loss Prevention Program rests with the senior management of each operating Group. Through their words and more importantly through their actions, senior management sets the tone for loss prevention throughout Messer Americas. While senior management sets the tone, middle management must create the uniform support and nurture the desired culture to influence the Loss Prevention program. This strong management commitment culminates with the day to day responsibility of implementing and managing the Loss Prevention program by \"line management\" (supervisor and lead personnel). Local management is accountable for the effective management of this program through their organization's per"

Loss prevention is no longer an activity that someone else is in charge of. Each manager, supervisor, driver, and line worker is personally responsible for insuring \"safe working conditions, safe product for all customers and a safe environment for the citizens of the communities in which Messer operates\".\n\n\nSIMPLIFIED PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe MG Industries Muscatine facility contains two carbon dioxide manufacturing plants.  The ammonia portions of these plants fall within the RMP requirements.  The raw carbon dioxide comes from a source via pipeline.  An ammonia chiller system pre-cools the gas, which condenses the excess water.  Condensed water is then removed in a water separator.  The carbon dioxide is then compressed in a series of low and high stage compressors.  The carbon dioxide then passes through a series of vessels to remove alcohols and hydrocarbons.  The carbon dioxide is then chilled and dried before being liquified in the carbon dioxide condenser.  Non-condensibles are removed from the stream using a stripper/reboiler column.  The liquid is sub-cooled and stored under pressure in large carbon steel storage vessels.\n\nThe aforementioned cooling and liquefaction steps are accomplished using ammonia refrigeration.  The ammonia exists in quantities large enough for RMP submission.  The safety-related equipment/devices are described later in this summary report.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe first step in the worst-case release analysis was to determine the total amount of ammonia onsite.  It was determined that there are 22,537 lbs of ammonia on-site.  While there are safety devices and process controls on the equipment to prevent accidental releases, a large natural disturbance such as a tornado could rip through the facility and create a worst-case r"

The Landview III software package was used to determine the general environmental and community impact within this radius.  There are approximately 2,716 people living within this radius.  Other public receptors include railroads, three parks, 5 landmarks, 2 cemeteries, 12 schools, 2 churches, a home for elders and children and seventeen businesses. There are no environmental receptors in the endpoint radius area.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe best alternative scenario that could be developed that would have an offsite impact was modeling damage to the pipe threads connected to a safety relief valve resulting in ammonia gas escaping.  A ten-minute time period was used for the release calculations.  This is an estimate on the maximum amount of time required to close the upstream valve manually.  The amount of ammonia released was calculated at 667 pounds using the RMP*Comp software.  The distance to endpoint was found to be 0.2 miles.  The Landview III software package was used to determine the general environmental and community impact within this radius.  There is approximately 23 person living within this radius.
