The Facility Policy:\n\nThe management and  employees of  Gavilon Fertilizer, LLC are committed to \nthe prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local responders are \nencouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and from time to time include \nsections of the management plan in those meetings.  If an accidental release should occur, \nthe facility is prepared to work with local emergency responders, and other authorities to \nmitigate any release, and to minimize the impact of a release on the population and \nenvironment.\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming \ncommunity in the area. Anhydrous ammonia, here after referred to as ammonia is \nreceived, store, and used in the production of non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solutions. \nAmmonia is an important source of nitrogen for agricultural crops during the spring and \nfall of the year.\n \nThe maximum quantity that can be stored at the facilities stationary storage is 130,000 \npounds.  The typical method of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing \n40,000 pounds. From time to time the Facility receives ammonia rail cars to use in the \n10-34-0 batch process.  Both the rail cars and transports are unloaded through a transfer \nsystem approved by the State of Minnesota Ag department.  The batch process is a large \nconsumer of the product but is intermittently operated.  \n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n   \nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards           \nInstitute \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" \nK61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2 for design, construction, and \nmaintenance of the process equipment.  The Facility also has a Process Safety  Program "
