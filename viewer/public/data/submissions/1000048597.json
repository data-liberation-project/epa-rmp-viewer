Third Coast Terminals (TCT) has implemented policies and procedures at the Pearland facility with a commitment for accident prevention and safety.  TCT provides safety rules, practices, and procedures to help prevent accidents and to respond to incidents.  TCT strives for a record of zero accidents.\n\n\n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThird Coast Terminals (TCT) is a specialized storage, toll processing, contract blending and drumming operation serving the Global Petrochemical Industry.  TCT handles two different toxic chemicals above threshold values for the RMP program.  TCT handles Toluene Diisocyanate mixed isomers in storage tanks, and in bulk shipping containers.  TCT handles Formaldehyde in mixture with methanol in bulk shipping containers.\n\n\n\n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThird Coast Terminals has implemented the aspects of the EPA RMP program level 2 for Toluene Diisocyanates.  The systems in place include specific batch process procedures, transfer procedures, and storage monitoring programs.  Only trained employees are allowed to operate Toluene Diisocyanate equipment.  Formaldehyde is handled in solution with methanol and is only stored on the Third Coast Terminal property for short periods of time.  The process that utilizes formaldehyde has implemented all aspects of the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP program elements.  The system has specific procedures, maintenance checks, and requires dedicated personnel to monitor the equipment while formaldehyde is present.\n\n\n\n(d) The five-year accident history:\n\nThird Coast Terminals (TCT) has not had an accidental releas"
