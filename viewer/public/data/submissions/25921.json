If an accidental releas should occur, our facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impact to people and the environment.  \n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.\n     The primary activity of our facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximunm quantity stored would be 284,100 pounds in our 18,000 gal. Storage tank and portable nurse tanks.\n3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n     A.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 80, 650 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to toxic endpoint is 4.2 miles.\n     B.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely otential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to toxic endpoint is 0.3 mile.\n4.   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n      Our facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,K61.1 published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29CFR1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as all applicable rules and regulations under the Iowa Fertilizer Law.\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that; have caused any deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM"

A copy of the Emergency Planning and Right to Know information as required under Sara Title III (EPCRA) has been supplied to authorities.\n7.   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY. \n      Safety improvement is anon-going process at our facilities.  Periodic valuations are performed to access the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia recommendations for implementation at this time."
