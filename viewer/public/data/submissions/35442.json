      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nChlorine is one of the most commonly used chemicals for treating wastewater.  The Valley Sanitary Water District Water Reclamation Plant (VSDWRP) also uses chlorine for treating wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. VSDWRP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe and disinfected water.  The following document describes what might happen in the unlikely event of an accident involving chemicals at VSDWRP, the steps taken every day to ensure safety, and what to do in the event of an emergency.  For questions or concerns, please contact Rex Sharp at 760/347-2356. \n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  These regulations require facilities storing large quantities of certain chemicals like chlorine to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  VSDWRP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from a liquid chlorine storage tank.  This document summarizes VSDWRP?s existing health and safety programs, internal response policies and procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of any accidental releases of chlorine into the environment.  VSDWRP has prepared an emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases.  To date, Valley Sanitary District has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nValley Sanitary District?s accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff fully trained in safe operation and maintenance practices, a"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nVSDWRP is a responding facility, which means the facility has prepared an emergency response plan to respond to chlorine accidental release.  In addition, the facility has coordinated with local response agencies.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe VSDWRP is located on 45-500 Van Buren Street, in Indio, California. The treatment facility is located on a land area of approximately 81 acres.  The Valley Sanitary District facility has operated since 1925.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages from the original 1.5 million gallons of water per day (mgd) to current capacity of 8.5 mgd.  The wastewater treated at Valley Sanitary district originates mainly from approximately 20,000 domestic and industrial users in the communities of Riverside county.   Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process,oxidation ponds, and a constructed wetlands to yield secondary effluents for purposes of re-use, and with post chlorination for discharge.  The purpose of the chlorination system is to prevent the spread of water borne diseases by means of chemically treating the plant effluent to kill disease-causing organisms.  \n\nAnhydrous chlorine used for chlorination is received in chlorine trailers and transferred to a storage tank located inside a chlorine shed.  In addition to the storage tank, the chlorination system consists of three chlorinators and injectors, piping and other equipment, and one chlorine detector with three sensors.  Gaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the bulk storage tank under its own pressure and flows through a pressure reducing valve, then a vacuum regulating valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate the chlorine vapo"

The injectors mix chlorine vapor with plant service water to create a chlorine solution that flows to the point of injection in the treatment process at service water pressure.\n\nThe chlorine gas sensors are used to sense chlorine leaks in the chlorine storage and use area.  Upon detection of approximately 3 ppmv chlorine, the chlorine analyzer will activate a yellow warning light and an audible alarm at the chlorine shed and a red light and audible alarm at the blower building.  A signal is also transmitted to a central alarm system in the control building to activate the alarm on the auto dialer and show an alarm indicator on the auto dialer panel.  The chlorine leak detection system is equipped with a backup battery supply.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nVSDWRP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements. VSDWRP?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\nComprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\nComprehensive preventive maintenance program.\nPerformance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\nUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\nHigh level of training of the operators and maintenance staff.\nImplementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\n\nProcess and Chemical Safety Informatio"

This information include chlorine background information and MSDS sheets.\n\nDetails such as maximum intended inventory and safe upper and lower operating limits are on file at the facility.  VSDWRP also has procedures in place that is triggered to update process safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1999, a detailed process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted for chlorination system equipment and procedures.  The PHA was revalidated in 2004 and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions was developed most recently during the 2004 PHA to improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions. Seismic assessments of the chlorine process were conducted in 1999 and 2004 and recommendations were provided to VSDWRP staff for their evaluation and implementation. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nVSDWRP maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for chlorine process. The operating procedures include start-up, normal operation, and shutdown procedures.  Operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or changes made in the handling of chlorine equipment, and reconfiguration of the facilities.\n\nTraining \n\nVSDWRP employees presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine process are trained in an overview of the process and detailed applicable operating and maintenance procedures.
