      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nChlorine is one of the most commonly used chemicals for treating wastewater.  The Valley Sanitary Water District Water Reclamation Plant (VSDWRP) also uses chlorine for treating wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. VSDWRP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe and disinfected water.  The following document describes what might happen in the unlikely event of an accident involving chemicals at VSDWRP, the steps taken every day to ensure safety, and what to do in the event of an emergency.  For questions or concerns, please contact Rex Sharp at 760/347-2356. \n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  These regulations require facilities storing large quantities of certain chemicals like chlorine to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  VSDWRP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from a liquid chlorine storage tank.  This document summarizes VSDWRP\u00bfs existing health and safety programs, internal response policies and procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of any accidental releases of chlorine into the environment.  VSDWRP has prepared an emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases.  To date, Valley Sanitary District has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nValley Sanitary District\u00bfs accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff fully trained in safe operation and maintenance practices, a"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nVSDWRP is a responding facility, which means the facility has prepared an emergency response plan to respond to chlorine accidental release.  In addition, the facility has coordinated with local response agencies.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe VSDWRP is located on 45-500 Van Buren Street, in Indio, California. The treatment facility is located on a land area of approximately 81 acres.  The Valley Sanitary District facility has operated since 1925.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages from the original 1.5 million gallons of water per day (mgd) to current capacity of 8.5 mgd.  The wastewater treated at Valley Sanitary district originates mainly from approximately 20,000 domestic and industrial users in the communities of Riverside county.   Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process,oxidation ponds, and a constructed wetlands to yield secondary effluents for purposes of re-use, and with post chlorination for discharge.  The purpose of the chlorination system is to prevent the spread of water borne diseases by means of chemically treating the plant effluent to kill disease-causing organisms.  \n\nAnhydrous chlorine used for chlorination is received in chlorine trailers and transferred to a storage tank located inside a chlorine shed.  In addition to the storage tank, the chlorination system consists of three chlorinators and injectors, piping and other equipment, and one chlorine detector with three sensors.  Gaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the bulk storage tank under its own pressure and flows through a pressure reducing valve, then a vacuum regulating valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate the chlorine vapo"
