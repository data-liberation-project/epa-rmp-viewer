We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.\n\nThe plant's accidental release prevention program is built upon a comprehensive safety program.  This includes a variety of procedures, equipment and training.  These program components are designed to effectively prevent, mitigate and respond to potential release situations.  Routine inspection and preventative maintenance programs are used to ensure integrity of hazardous material storage tanks and key safety controls.  Process equipment changes are reviewed during the design phase for potential environmental, safety or health impacts.  Routine audits and inspections are performed to ensure correct procedures are followed.  Alarms, interlocks, spill containment, vapor supression, vent vapor collection and treatment systems are in place for control and mitigation of vinyl acetate releases.  Any release incident is investigated to identify prevention and improvement opportunities.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n     *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n     *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n     *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n     *  An overview of our emergency response program\n     *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from\n        occuring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n     *  The certification that EPA's RMP rule re"

      "SummaryText": "e.  Vinyl acetate storage and use was audited in 1994 under the Process Safety Management system and all vessels containing vinyl acetate have been upgraded during the years as recommended in the audit.  Systems added to improve safety and prevent release as a result of the audit are:  vapor detectors in two sump locations to detect spills, reinforcement of the three polymerization reactors to withstand deflagration without releasing vessel contents, replacement of two collector tanks and a day storage tank with new tanks rated to withstand deflagration without releasing contents, and nitrogen inerting of the main vinyl acetate storage tank with an oxygen analyzer to prevent a deflagration.  Rail car sittings were fitted with track pans that direct any potential spill to a containment sump.  The vent chiller system has been upgraded and replaced for the storage tanks, and a new chilled water coil was added to the collector tank design to reduce emissions and improve safety.  In addition, vinyl acetate distillation for the removal of polymerization inhibiter has been eliminated, and a new safer process which directly reacts the vinyl acetate as shipped has reduced the emissions from the process and improved process safety.  As part of on-going compliance with regulatory and industry requirements subsequent audits have resulted in the following projects to enhance the safety of the operation:  power distribution upgrades and relocation of motor control centers outside the manufacturing building to remove potential sources of ignition, automation of reaction vessel condenser cleaning to reduce the risk of a runaway reaction, automation of backup nitrogen agitation of reactors, data historian improvements, railcar static ground detectors, and security enhancements covering perimeter security and site access.\n\nVinyl acetate shipments into the plant are treated at the supplier with inhibiter to prevent polymerization reaction while in shipment and storage.

      "SummaryText": "ate rail cars that enter the plant for unloading are sampled for identification and quality to prevent the accidental mixing of a different substance that could react in the storage tanks.\n\nThe storage tanks and reactors have chilled vent condensers to reduce emissions.  The reactors and collector tanks are equipped with back up cooling water and with automatic short stop systems that in an emergency can stop the reaction.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The Trenton plant's release records have been reviewed for the period of 1999 to May, 2004.  This review identified no releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nAnnual drills are conducted with pertinent emergency responders to ensure response to a release would be conducted in a coordinated and organized manner.  Participants in the 2003 site emergency response drill included 4 local fire departments, 4 local police departments, Downriver Emergency Response Team, 2 local healthcare systems and the Hospital Emergency Management System, Wayne County Emergency Management Division"
