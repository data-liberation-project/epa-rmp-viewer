These high standards include:\r\n\r\n-  Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n-  Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n-  Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n-  Correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nMorris Storage and Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n-  Hazardous atmosphere monitors (HAM) have been installed at the facility, which will shutdown power to the loading facility upon a positive reading.\r\n-  Manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons have been installed at the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.\r\n-  Fire eyes have been installed at various locations to warn of a fire at the facility.\r\n-  A continuous flare is tied into critical equipment to minimize the possibility of releases.\r\n-  The facility is manned 24 hours per day, which improves response time in the event of a release.\r\n-  The Tulsa Control Center can detect high and low pressure on the pipeline and storage vessels as well"

At the facility, ethane/propane mix (EP Mix) is stored in an underground storage cavern until it is transferred, via pipeline, to the customer.   Butanes, natural gasoline, and propane are received via pipeline and stored in above ground storage tanks until they are loaded on trucks for distribution to customers.  Ethyl mercaptan is used as an odorant for propane and is stored at the facility and injected into truck trailers during propane loading.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) substances stored at the facility are normal butane, isobutane, propane, ethyl mercaptan, and two flammable mixtures.  The flammable mixtures are EP Mix, containing ethane and propane; and natural gasoline, containing pentane and other non-RMP hydrocarbons.  No RMP toxic substances are present at the facility.
