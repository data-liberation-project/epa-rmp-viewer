Policies in effect relate to operations and maintenance of equipment, ongoing employee training, emergency response planning and coordination with appropriate local response agencies.  These policies are embodied in the Risk Management Plan and OSHA Process Safety Manual, which together provide the means to prevent or mitigate accidental releases.\n\n    The Maple Creek WWTP is located off Gilliam Road to the east of the City of Greer.  This facility treats domestic and industrial wastewaters for subsequent discharge into the South Tyger River under NPDES Permit No. SC0046345.  Treatment processes include solids screening, SBR system, disinfection, and equalization basin.\n\n    Disinfection is accomplished by chlorination of the plant effluent prior to entering the equalization basin.  Facilities in place to accomplish this task include pumping and chlorinator equipment to provide a chlorine solution at rates proportional to discharge flow rates.  Chlorine for this process is stored and handled on-site in ton cylinders.  Normal operations include two cylinders on-line, with zero spare cylinders in reserve.  The on-line cylinders have individual vacuum regulators, and are manifolded on the vacuum side with automatic switchover to the chlorination equipment.\n\n    Chlorine is the only regulated substance maintained on-site in quantities above the regulated threshold limit.\n\n    The general accidental release prevention program is a multi-faceted effort configured to comply with both EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM rules.  Key elements include a high level of employee training, an aggressive equipment maintenance routine, detailed operation procedures, hazard reviews and management controls.\n\n    Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous a"

The program includes itemized response steps including notification instructions.  Emergency action drills are conducted annually.\n\n    Continual evaluation of technology and operations are performed to identify improvements that may help prevent or mitigate accidental releases.\n\n"
