      "SummaryText": "Rural Gas, Inc.\n\nPrepared By: Bruce Ball\n\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy:\n\nOur employees will do what is possible with their training to stop the release, but will not be emergency responders. The Belleville fire department will be the emergency responders and the Local Emergency Planning Committee will be used for a major evacuation.\n\n\n\n2.Facility Information\n\nThe NH3 facility is located south of the man office. Rural Gas, Inc. receives storage and distributes Anhydrous Ammonia to farmers as agricultural nutrients.\n\n\n\n3. The Worse Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nWorse case scenario would release 71,356 pounds in a 10 minute period or 7,135 pounds per minute with a 0.89 mile to end point. Alternative release could involved a transfer hose rupture this would result in a release of 7,127 pounds in a 2 minute period with a .46 mile to end point.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention\n\nRural Gas, Inc. recognizes all safety regulations and procedures required by State and Federal Agencies and has annual training for the employees. The most common accidental release would be overfilling of nurse trailers: An example would be a nurse trailer filled to 90% on a cool morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valve to let product escape. Rural Gas Policy is not to fill above 85%.\n\n\n\n5. Fire Year Accident History\n\nThere has not been a reportable accident in the last five years. \n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nRural Gas, Inc. has an Emergency Action Plan and a Safety Director. All areas have worked with the county, city, and insurance company's loss control department for the development of these plans.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Safety Changes\n\nThe company Safety Director and Operations Manager tour the branch once per month. All areas are toured once a quarter. Changes are made on an as needed basis as new regulations or concerns arise."
