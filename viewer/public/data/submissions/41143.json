      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2004 RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM UPDATE\n\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at Arkema Inc., Houston, Texas production facility to reduce the risk of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  \n\nARKEMA POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at Arkema for many years.  The Risk Management Plan formalizes and documents these activities.  Arkema is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reduce risks to health and the environment.  Commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES Matters.  Emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Arkema's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.  Arkema's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Arkema's commitment to health, environment and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.  This facility is covered by Title V of the Clean Air Act but has not received a permit as of the date of this submittal.  \n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES\n\nThe Arkema Houston facility is located at 2231 Haden Road, Houston, Texas.  The facility manufactures mercaptans and sulfides.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk management Program (RMP) rule.  These substances ar"

Carbon Disulfide is a by-product of Hydrogen Sulfide production.  Hydrogen Sulfide is manufactured on site to produce mercaptans.  \n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Arkema Houston facility has an accidental release prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases.  This program is designed to address the requirements of 29 CFR 1920.119, Process Safety management (PSM) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program addresses processes that handle regulated substances.  The accidental release prevention program includes the following components and activities:\n\nIn depth hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the OSHA PSM Standard of 29 CFR 1920.119:  Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;  \n\nOperators, mechanics and contractor personnel are qualified trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;  \n\nA management of change system is in place to ensure that process-operating changes are managed safely,\n\nCritical equipment is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to ensure proper operating condition,\n\nPre-start up review are performed to ensure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment,\n\nIncidents are investigated and actions taken as part of a continuous improvement effort,\n\nRoutine audits are conducted to ensure that safe practices are being followed,\n\nStorage vessels are designed and constructed in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel standards using industry-standard materials of co"

Management and facility personnel strive for continuing improvements in accident reduction.  The training, qualification standards, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are key elements in reducing and mitigation accidents.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no off-site or on-site releases of carbon disulfide or hydrogen sulfide that have resulted in the on-site injuries during the past five years. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nA written Emergency Response plan is maintained at the facility.  The plan was developed in cooperation with civil authorities and was coordinate"

The plan also includes documentation of proper firs aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposure; procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection and testing.  The plan also includes a description of the training program for all employees in relevant emergency response procedures and procedures for review and update, as appropriate, of the response plan, to reflect changes at the facility and to ensure that employees are informed of these changes.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nChemical safety has been a part of the working culture at the facility for many years.  Chemical exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts as well as regulatory requirements.  Planned improvements to the existing safety program include; implementation of behavior based safety programs and additional accident investigation training.   Participation in the Modern Safety Management (MSM) program, a certified internal audit system, is in progress.  Additional planned facility improvements include upgrades in the process control systems of a production unit and increased security measures."
