Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n                                                                                                                                                                                       The owners, management, and employees are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, county LEPC, EPA, and other applicable authorities to mitigate the release and minimize its impact on people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Substance Handled  \n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a fertilizer for crop production. \n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The facility has also complied with the Ohio Department of Agriculture \"Regulations For Storing And Handling Fertilizer Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that has caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.  Neither has there been a release that, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has: \n-a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n-a written Emergency Response"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed by company personnel and by the Ohio Department of Agriculture to assess the safety of equipment and procedures.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation as this time."
