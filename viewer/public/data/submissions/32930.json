Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Verona Pumping Station (Water Treatment Plant) are strongly committed to\nemployee, public and environmental safety. This is demonstrated, by an accidental release\nprevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures,\nmaintenance and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our\npolicy, through the use of appropriate controls, to prevent the release of the regulated\nsubstance used in our operation. If such a release should occur, we are completely\ncoordinated with the HAZMAT unit of the Battle Creek Fire Department. They would\nprovide the highly trained emergency response personnel to control the effects of any\nrelease.\n\nThe Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary activity of the Verona Pumping Station is Municipal Water Supply and\nTreatment. We have 1 regulated substance at our facility. That substance is Chlorine. It is\nused in the treatment process for oxidation and disinfection.\n\nThe maximum inventory at the Verona Pumping Station is 24,000 lbs. It is stored in 1\nlocation in 2,000 lb. cylinders.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each scenario.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario, we have used the AWWA Compliance Guidance and\nModel Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants. We have used the same\nreference book for the alternative scenario. The details are as follows.\n\nThe worst case scenario submitted is CLW-2. This is for a program 3 toxic substance and\ninvolves a catastrophic release of Chlorine. The scenario involves a direct release of 2,000\nlbs. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. At Class F atmospheric stability and\n1.5 m/s wind speed, a maximum distance of 2.63 miles is needed in an urban setting to"
