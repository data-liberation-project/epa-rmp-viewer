The only chemical currently at Aquatics that meets this definition is chlorine (Cl2). Table 2.1.1 (below) lists the stationary sources to which this plan currently applies. The process at each identified stationary source is the treatment of swimming pool water using chlorine gas fed from a ton container.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2.1.1\r\nCovered Processes\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\t                ADDRESS\t                           Max Cl2, Lbs.\r\n\r\nMcDowell Mountain Ranch Aquatic Center\t15525 N.

This plan has the full approval of management with the authority to commit the necessary resources to implement it in accordance with the requirements of the RPM Standard and the policies of the City. The City will provide all funds, manpower, equipment and materials necessary to fully implement this plan.\r\n\r\nEach employee has a vested interest in providing for and assisting with the development and implementation of work practices to protect employee health, welfare and the environment.

The program, which is described further in Section 6.0 of this plan, includes:\r\n\r\n1.\tAn emergency response plan that is maintained at each stationary source and contains at least: procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases; documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; and procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\r\n\r\n2.\tProcedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance;\r\n\r\n3.\tTraining for all employees in relevant procedu"
