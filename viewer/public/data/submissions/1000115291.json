      "SummaryText": "Keystone Cement operates a portland cement manufacturing operation on an approximate 850 acre parcel of land, located in Bath, PA. The facility operates a dry process preheater/precalciner and associated raw and finished material processing operations in the production of portland cement. Raw material is mined on site and processed in preparation for use in the production of portland cement.\r\n\r\nThe Keystone Cement facility also includes a fully permitted waste fuel storage tank facility. Waste fuel is received at the facility via tanker truck from off site and pumped into one of four waste fuel storage tanks.\r\n\r\nThe tank farm facility consists of four storage tanks, associated ancillary equipment, and tanker truck unloading area on the solvent pad. Waste fuel is transferred to the cement kilns via aboveground pipeline. The storage tanks and tanker truck unloading area are interconnected via pipelines and are also considered co-located within the tank farm and therefore, for purposes of compliance with 40 CFR Part 68, the Keystone Cement facility is considered to have one regulated process, the tank farm storage facility.\r\n\r\nThe threshold quantity determination performed at the Keystone Cement facility used several conservative assumptions as outlined in the EPA RMP guidance document for warehousing (1/99). From this threshold determination, the facility developed a list of regulated substances that could potentially (although unlikely) be present in the regulated process above the applicable threshold quantity as follows: acrylonitrile, allyl alcohol, ammonia, carbon disulfide, chloroform, and vinyl acetate monomer.\r\n\r\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed in accordance with EPA guidance to determine the distances to the endpoints for each substance. From this analysis, it was determined that the facility did not have any public receptors within the distance to the endpoint for the worst-case toxic release scenario. In addition, the facility has not had any"

The Risk Management Program is designed to address all potential hazards and comply with the general duty clause of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\r\n\r\nThe Keystone prevention program includes 1) the development of a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program, 2) the performance of a hazard review, 3) the development of standard operating procedures for the regulated process (including maintenance procedures), 4) the implementation of a risk management program training plan, 5) the performance of compliance audits and incident investigations, and 6) procedures for maintaining and updating safety information for the process and regulated constituents.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as a RCRA permitted facility, Keystone Cement has implemented a Prevention, Preparedness, and Contingency Plan in accordance with the Federal RCRA regulations at 40 CFR Part 264 and the Pennsylvania RCRA regulations at PA Code, Title 25, Chapter 264a. This plan is maintained on site and has been coordinated with the local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the facility include ongoing training of employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the regulated process. The training incorporates, but is not limited to, safe handling practices, hazard prevention, and emergency response. Regular safety meetings are held at the facility to discuss site safety procedures and continually evaluate existing safety procedures. Off-site contractors are provided safety training as appropriate and r"
