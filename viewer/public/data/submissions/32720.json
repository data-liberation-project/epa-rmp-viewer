The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n? Introduction;\n? Facility and regulated substances identification;\n? Prevention Program;\n? Five-Year Accident History;\n? Emergency Response Plan; and\n? Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nIntroduction\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Organichem; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Organichem is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.\n\nFacility  and Regulated  Substance Identification\nOrganichem Corporation owns and operates a pharmaceutical plant in Renssaelaer, NY adjacent to the Hudson River and across the river from the state capital (Albany). Chlorine, a regulated toxic RMP substance with a threshold quantity for accidental release prevention of 2,500 pounds, is used at the facility as an ingredient in the manufacture of Sodium Iodine Dichloride.  \n\nPrevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers the chlorine component of the Sodium Iodine Dichloride process in which chlorine is present above the threshold quantity for both PSM andr RMP rules. \nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n? Process safety information is provided to all employees upon hire and "

Written operating procedures (kept up-to-date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n? Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given annually or upon request.\n? Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n? Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n? A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and computerized documentation.\n? A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\n? A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely.\n? Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n? Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\nThis systematic approach to process safety at Organichem involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in overall safety. The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents/release of chlorine at Organichem which led to on-site deaths, injuries or significant damage in the past five years.  There are also no reported incidents of off-site consequences from an accidental release of chlorine.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nOrganichem has an emergency response plan to ensure that in the event of an emergency the personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and aut"
