In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\nOne of our company goals states, \"To provide for the Safety and Security of our employees, our customers, the general public and to be good stewarts of the enrivonment for which we serve\".  To fulfill these goals, we enroll in a regulatory management service that assists in maintaining and administering comprehensive safety and environmental programs, procedures and training courses.  We perform a thorough annual audit program and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards and overseen assistance with this speciality firm.  The program consists of internal audit utilizing checklists survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local regulations are covered.  These checklists are used to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Procedures require a timely response and correction of all recommendations resulting from these audit checklists.\n\nA \"Site Safety Coordinator\" is identified and used as an extension of the general manager and management service personnel for a \"hands on\" manager of the day to day safe working activities, maintain the required regulatory recordkeeping, conduct monthly safety meetings, conduct employee training and act as the location's contact during emergency incidents that are rehearsed biannually.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe facility is a retail farm supply and distribution center and as such we store and distribute a wide variety of pestic"

      "SummaryText": "ides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with this Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to growers in nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a needed source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  \n\nOur facility maintains twenty-seven 1,000-gallon nurse tanks for delivery.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 18,000 gallon stationary storage tank.  The maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks is 84,000 pounds.  The largest storage vessel at our facility contains 84,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of cacacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe most common alternate release scenario(s) from an anhydrous ammonia storage facility would not reach an endpoint off-site.  The alternate release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a two-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shutdown.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 300 pounds from the storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint would have an impact.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia storage system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.

The load-out risers used for the purpose to filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser valves are locked when not in use.  Lighting for the facility has increased to discourage the increase of meth theft.\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines with the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever compliance with the regulations are questioned.  In accordance with the 1989 ANSI standards, training is also offered for all ammonia customers to attend on a regular basis and offered to the local fire department personnel during their annual tour of our facility and operations.  These training courses consist of classroom lecture, current and approved videos or compact disc, testing both verbally and written, demonstration and observation for each person working with the process that are certified while on-going job training is always improved upon.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that has caused deaths, recordable injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off site.\n\n                                                                           \n\nTHE 'EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND CONTINGENCY PLAN'\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the l"
