The pressure vessels accommodate the receipt of butane and propane and facilitate subsequent butane blending operations.  This is the only regulated process governed by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulated, meeting the NFPA 4 flammability requirements governing RMP.  \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe North Little Rock Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  In June 2001, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP) purchased the facility, which has handled Butane and Propane since 1997 without a harmful release.  If an emergency were to occur, it is MMP written policy to notify the North Little Rock LEPC and request they respond to the emergency.  \n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 63,000 gallon butane storage tank when it is filled to the maximum allowed level (83% or 58,100 gallons), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and residences are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a one-square inch puncture of the propane vessel, leading to a 10-minute release of propane and subsequent explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint does not extend offsite.  \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility is compliant with the elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training"

      "SummaryText": " programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The butane storage and distribution system is governed by OSHA's PSM regulation.  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the tanks and equipment.  \n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the covered processes at North Little Rock Terminal that have required reporting under the RMP rule.  Furthermore, North Little Rock Terminal has never had an accident involving butane or propane that has resulted in death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in place.  \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  The terminal is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Within the past five years, the process has no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b) (1)).  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated within the RMP. The undersigned certifies to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed and reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.  \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane blending process.  As opportunities for improvement associated with the new butane process arise at the Little Rock Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Terminal Holdings, L.P.\n\n"
