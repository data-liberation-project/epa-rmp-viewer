This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are addressed in the individual RMP/PSM procedures which detail the RMP/PSM program requirements as well as how North Shore will comply with the applicable requirements. The site is not a responding facility for releases of the RMP listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nStationary Source:\r\nThe Painter facility is located in Uinta County, approximately 10.5 miles northeast of Evanston, Wyoming.  The legal location is in Section 32, Township 16N, Range 119W. \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe North Shore Painter facility uses and stores flammable mixtures of several chemicals that are subject to reporting under RMP, including methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane and isopentane as described below.   \r\n\r\nCovered Process Description:\r\nThe Painter facility has one covered process that includes storage and handling of the listed hydrocarbons.  The RMP covered process boundary at the site includes the entire NGL/NRU process which is made up of the inlet process, methane process, propane process, gas process, condensate process and NGL process.  \r\n\r\nThe two production facilities associated with the Painter Facility (Painter Central and East Painter) receive a mixed well stream fluid from their specific production portions of the Painter Reservoir field. In both cases the well stream fluid is passed through two-phase high pressure and three-phase low press"

Condensate oil is stored in tanks equipped with vapor recovery systems to capture any escaping gas vapors, then pumped out to sales via pipeline. Produced water is re-injected into the geologic formation.\r\n\r\nAfter the condensate and water are removed from the natural gas, the remaining gas is sent to the Painter facility for natural gas liquids (NGL) removal.  After the NGL is removed from the gas stream, the gas is allocated to sales as directed by the various corporate interests. At East Painter, the gas can also be re-injected into the formation, although nitrogen from adjacent nitrogen plants is used as the primary reservoir pressure maintenance fluid. Produced water from the separators is also re-injected into the formation.\r\n\r\nThe Painter facility is rated to process 240 MMSCFD of sweet gas from the surrounding fields.  Currently gas is supplied from the Painter and East Painter fields.  The gas is received at inlet separators where the condensate is removed, these liquids are then sent in turn to a demethanizer, a condensate stabilizer and to sales.\r\n\r\nNatural gas from the inlet separators and recompressed ethane from the deethanizer are then sent to an amine contactor for removal of C02.  From the amine system the gas goes to dehydration, first in triethelyne glycol (TEG) contactors and then molecular sieve beds.  There is also a mercury removal system, which prevents fouling in the next process and the NGL/NRU recovery \"cold box.\"  This cryogenic process separately condenses natural gas liquids (NGL) and nitrogen at specific temperatures for removal of each product.  The NGL is sent to storage and sales through third-party pipelines.  The residue natural gas is compressed by electric compressors and is sold to sales pipelines. \r\n\r\nNitrogen is now the sole agent for pressure maintenance in the two fields supplying the Painter NGL/NRU plant.

Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Painter NGL/NRU Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\r\n \r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Painter NGL/NRU Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Painter NGL/NRU Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nThe Painter NGL/NRU Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating a"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Painter NGL/NRU Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe  Painter NGL/NRU Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, the  Painter NGL/NRU Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Painter NGL/NRU Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Painter NGL/NRU Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Painter NGL/NRU Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the facility notifies the LEPC of any changes regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility to local emergency responders through annual SARA reporting.  \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe facility most recently completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) revalidation study on May 8, 2018 which identified several recommendations for enhanced process safety.  These recommendations are summarized in the PHA report and are currently under evaluation and/or are in the process of implementation."
