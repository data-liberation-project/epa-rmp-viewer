      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Stop & Shop Supermarket Company LLC began operations of the new Distribution Facility in Freetown, Massachusetts in 2004.  The Freetown Distribution Facility is a refrigerated facility utilized by Stop & Shop for the storage and distribution of products to over 240 stores.  Since many of these products must remain refrigerated, Stop & Shop operates a refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is identified as a toxic gas in the EPA regulation \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program\" or \"RMP.\"\r\n\r\nRefrigeration systems that use anhydrous ammonia are an established and recognized technology and have been in use for decades.  EPA recognizes that ammonia refrigeration plants are very different from complex chemical processing operations.  The complex level of operations involved in chemical processing plants is not found in refrigerated facilities where there are no chemical reactions.  While there are new developments leading to more efficient operations, the design principals are fully available.  A complete understanding of the safe design and operating guidelines has been available to design and operating practitioners in the industry for some time.  As is common for most commercial systems, the Stop & Shop refrigeration system operates in a sequential mode based on the heat load.  The heat load is based upon the material being moved into the warehouse and by outside air temperatures.  As such, the process control parameters of greatest consequences are the temperature and pressure readings throughout the system.\r\n\r\nAs part of the RMP, Stop & Shop has conducted analyses of two ammonia release scenarios, the \"worst case\" scenario and the \"alternative release\" scenario.  Following EPA guidance, the worst case release was defined as the largest ammonia containing vessel, specifically the medium temperature recirculator (Vessel-3) with a maximum inventory of 12,426 pounds.

The area affected by the worst case release was determined using the EPA's own Offsite Consequences Analysis dispersion model RMP Comp.  Under the hypothetical scenario, ammonia vapor would travel past the boundary of the facility as it dispersed with air, reaching approximately 1.0 miles from the point of release.  Although the probability of such a release is extremely remote, an estimated population of 755 could potentially be impacted by such a release.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is defined to be a more plausible case than the worst case scenario, and is useful as a planning case for the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and other emergency responders.  The approach for selecting the alternative release involved an examination of three sources: \r\n\r\n1.\tthe Process Hazards Analysis conducted on the system;  \r\n2.\tpast (non-reportable minor) release events at the Stop & Shop distribution facility; and\r\n3.\tthe industry specific Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration guidance document, sponsored by the EPA.  \r\n\r\nThe scenario selected was a motor pump failure for a pump in the machine room and was based on a very minor similar release that did occur at the Freetown Facility.  Hypothetically, if a pump failed completely in the machine room, the following sequence of events would be triggered:\r\n\r\n1.\tAt 250 ppm, the ammonia detector would stop all compressors\r\n2.\tAll pumps would shut down\r\n3.\tAn alarm would sound in the maintenance shop and guard station\r\n4.\tA guard would notify a maintenance mechanic\r\n5.\tEven if there were no attempt to isolate the leak or if all the mechanical controls and all active safety systems failed to operate, approximately 1,700 to 2,800 pounds of ammonia would potentially be released.\r\n\r\nFor the alternative release scenario, it is assumed that 2,800 pounds of ammonia would be"

Incorporating the same dispersion model used in the worst case scenario, the alternative release was determined to result in an ammonia vapor cloud reaching a distance of three tenths of a mile from the point of release and, according to the 2010 Census, would not impact any population.\r\n\r\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to ensure the overall safety of our facility, we have in place a number of protective measures to prevent the discharge of anhydrous ammonia into the atmosphere, and to provide our employees and neighbors with a safe environment.  These include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tAn extensive preventative maintenance program, following manufacturer's recommendations as well as recognized industry practices, to ensure the overall safety of our process equipment;\r\n\u00bf\tDaily documented inspections of the refrigeration system;\r\n\u00bf\tSafety interlocks on all major process equipment that automatically activate, based on predetermined temperature and pressure settings;\r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia leak detectors tied into an alarm system that allows us to safely monitor refrigerated areas;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining regarding the properties and hazards associated with ammonia for all Stop & Shop associates as part of the Hazard Communication Program, with additional training provided for all employees who work with the refrigeration system;\r\n\u00bf\tDaily dialogue between the Operations and Maintenance employees regarding the operating status of the refrigeration system; and\r\n\u00bf\tMaintaining an open dialogue with the Freetown Fire Department and the Southcoast Regional Emergency Planning Commission (REPC).\r\n\r\nTo provide the most effective means of process control, Stop & Shop installed a programmable controller to monitor and reliably control all operating conditions within the refrigeration system.

The shutdown can either be achieved through the main controller or the emergency stop button located on the exterior of the engine room.\r\n\r\nThe Freetown facility is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In accordance with that standard, a comprehensive program has been implemented which addresses process hazards analysis, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, emergency preparedness and other process safety-related topics.\r\n\r\nThe RMP requires that we report a five-year history for accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuation or shelter in place of the community, or environmental damage.  Since this facility opened in 2004, no such releases have occurred.  Many efforts have been made to reduce the potential risks associated with the refrigeration system.  In the event that a significant ammonia release occurred, the facility's Emergency Response Plan would be activated.  The Emergency Response Plan has been developed to define what actions Stop & Shop associates are to take in the event of an ammonia release, and to identify those actions to be performed by the Fire Department and emergency response contractors.\r\n\r\nStop & Shop maintenance department employees act as primary responders only in environments containing less than 300 parts per million (ppm).  For releases exceeding this level, the Freetown Fire Department would be notified along with designated emergency response contractors.  The building would be evacuated as appropriate and the maintenance department employees would provide secondary assistance to the responders, as needed.
