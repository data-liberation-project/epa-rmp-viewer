Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n    The Upper Bear Creek Water Filter Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that integrates areas such as design, installation, management practices, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorination process at our facility.  The chlorination system at our plant consists of chlorine gas used to make chlorine dioxide used for pre-treatment and chlorine gas alone for final disinfection.  Our system is one of the most simplified and safest chlorination systems available for disinfecting water.  Appropriate controls and alarms are also in place to prevent possible releases of chlorine.  Furthermore, all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program Level 2 are adhered to.  \n\n\n\nIn the event an accidental release does occur, our facility is coordinated with the Marion County Emergency Management Agency, local fire and police departments, as well as, Harcros Chemicals in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  These institutions provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.    Our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility is a publicly owned water treatment plant.  Our primary activity is treating potable water and pumping it into the distribution system for public use.  We provide water to many residents, businesses, and industries in Bear Creek, Haleyville, and Phil Campbell, Alabama.  We have one regulated substance, Chlorine.  The Chlorine is used to make Chlorine Dioxide for pre-treatment and for final disinfection of the treated water.  The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 9,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nTwo possible chlorine release scenarios, a \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release\" were analyzed in accordance with EPA's RMP regulations.  To perform the required scenario analyses for our facility, we used reference tables for the Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)] model provided by the American Water Works Association (AWWA).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario, as required by EPA, assumes the maximum quantity of chlorine in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified failure.  Our largest vessel is a ton (2,000 pounds) container.  Neither passive nor active mitigation was considered.  At class F atmospheric stability, a 1.5 m/s windspeed, and a temperature of 107 deg. F, a maximum distance of 3.04 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.  The potentially affected residential population was estimated to be approximately 2232.  Nineteen public receptors and no environmental receptors were identified in the toxic endpoint area.\n\n    \n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes the chlorine release is less severe and is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.  The scenario chosen involves a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the 5/16 diameter valve body opening.  The total quantity released is 317 pounds with a maximum sustained release rate of 10.5 pounds per minute.  At class D atmospheric stability, a 3.0 m/s windspeed, and a temperature of 107 deg. F, a maximum distance of 0.57 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.  The potentially affected residential population was estimated at 91.  Five public receptors and no environmental receptors were identified in the toxic endpoint area.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\n    Safety Information\n\nOur facility maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the chlorine process.\n\n\n\n    Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts a comprehensive overview and analysis of our chlorination system to ensure that the associated hazards are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out this analysis is a hazard review checklist specifically designed for water treatment plants.  This checklist was designed to meet the requirements of The Chlorine Manual published by The Chlorine Institute.  The analyses are performed by qualified personnel and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n    Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorination process, our facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, maintenance or cylinder change operations, and receiving chlorine cylinders.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the chlorination process.\n\n\n\n    Training\n\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the chlorine process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years in accordance with EPA's RMP regulations and more frequently as needed.\n\n    \n\n        Maintenance\n\nOur facility has established routine maintenance checks on the chlorine"

In accordance with EPA's RMP regulations we perform these audits at least every three years.  Any corrective actions resulting from these audits are completed in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\n    Incident Investigation\n\nOur facility promptly investigates any incident which resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations provide valuable information for assessing all possible causes of the incident ranging from human error to equipment failure.  In addition, possible corrective actions are identified to prevent the accident from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years as required by EPA's RMP regulations. \n\n\n\n5.    Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOur facility takes pride in doing everything possible to prevent accidental releases and has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period. \n\n\n\n6.    Emergency Response\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of chlorine, we at the Upper Bear Creek Water, Sewer and Fire Protection District have opted not to implement an Emergency Response Program.
