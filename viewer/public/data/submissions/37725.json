Glatfelter Company (Glatfelter) is a global manufacturer of specialty papers and engineered products.  Glatfelter\u00bfs Spring Grove Mill, located in the Borough of Spring Grove in York County Pennsylvania, is an integrated Kraft pulp and paper manufacturing facility.  Glatfelter has implemented and maintains an Environmental Management System that is certified by a third party registrar to conform to the ISO 14001 standard.  The foundation of the Environmental Management System is Glatfelter\u00bfs Environmental Policy, which expresses Glatfelter\u00bfs commitment to reducing adverse environmental impacts that may be caused by its operations. \n\nGlatfelter is committed to operating its facilities in both a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  In 1999, Glatfelter made a commitment to eliminate the use of elemental chlorine, a regulated toxic substance subject to EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (Risk Management Plan) and OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements.  In 2003, Glatfelter eliminated the use of elemental chlorine from 90-ton rail cars at the Spring Grove Mill, which reduced the amount of chlorine on site from more than 180,000 pounds to less than 16,000 pounds.  In June 2004, Glatfelter further reduced the amount of chlorine stored on site to less than 1,500 pounds.  Thus, the facility is no longer subject to Risk Management Plan or Process Safety Management requirements for chlorine.  By the end of 2004, Glatfelter expects to have eliminated all elemental chlorine from the facility. \n\nChlorine dioxide, a regulated toxic substance, is generated at the Spring Grove Mill for on-site use in pulp bleaching operations to obtain the pulp brightness and cleanliness necessary for the grades of paper manufactured at the facility.  Chlorine dioxide is present at the facility in an amount exceeding the threshold quantity specified in the Chemical Ac"

No other regulated substances are present at the Spring Grove Mill in an amount exceeding a regulated threshold quantity.  As noted above, until very recently, the Spring Grove Mill was also subject to Risk Management Plan requirements for chlorine.  \n\nGlatfelter has implemented the requirements of EPA\u00bfs Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management provisions through its ISO 14001-certified Environmental Management System (EMS) by including its combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan (PSM/RMP) as one of the procedures in the EMS.  Glatfelter\u00bfs PSM/RMP has a separate chapter for each of the RMP Prevention Program elements describing Glatfelter\u00bfs procedures for complying with that particular element.  The Spring Grove Mill\u00bfs primary release prevention activity is maintenance of the chlorine dioxide system in good working order.  This is done through routine inspections of the equipment, piping, storage vessels, and instrumentation, and preventive maintenance.  Since the first RMP was submitted in June 1999, Glatfelter has also installed a water suppression system in and around the chlorine dioxide storage tank containment area in order to minimize the impact of any releases in that area.\n\nOver the past 5 years, there have been no accidents at the Spring Grove Mill of the magnitude described in the RMP regulations.  Mill employees have the training and equipment necessary to deal with minor on-site emergencies.  For emergencies requiring outside assistance (defined in our detailed plans) and for all emergency situations where the general public may be affected, York County Control (911) will be contacted and mill employees will respond to assist neighboring and York County Emergency Management Agency personnel.  \n\nThe most significant change currently pl"
