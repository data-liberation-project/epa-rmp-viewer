Barry Road, in Natchez, Adams\n\nCounty, Mississippi. Ammonia and oleum are among the raw materials\n\nused in the manufacturing process at the facility. Due to the\n\nquantity of these chemicals stored at the facility, the facility\n\nis subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's\n\nRisk Management Program.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is to prevent or reduce\n\nthe severity of an accidental release of a hazardous chemical.\n\nAmong the requirements of the Risk Management Program is the\n\nsubmission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizing the overall\n\nprogram. The following information is an Executive Summary of the\n\ninformation contained in the Risk Management Program. This\n\nExecutive Summary includes a description of the company's\n\naccidental release prevention and safety policies, a facility and\n\nprocess description, an explanation of the accidental release\n\nscenarios studied, a five-year accident history, and details of\n\nthe facility's accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nEthyl Petroleum Additives takes great care to ensure the safety of\n\nits employees, visitors, and the surrounding community. Corporate\n\nand facility policies and safety programs are stressed in all\n\naspects of facility operations.\n\n\n\n2.1  Ethyl Corporate Policies\n\n\n\nEthyl Petroleum Additives adheres to corporate environmental and\n\nsafety policies established by its corporate parent, Ethyl\n\nCorporation, of Richmond, Virginia. These policies advocate safety\n\nfrom the design process through actual production.  Ethyl\n\nCorporation's Process Technology Program is intended to ensure\n\ntechnical adequacy and safety while developing new products or\n\nrevising existing products. For each new or modified pr"

The program is implemented through written approvals from\n\ninvolved parties-safety, engineering, management, and production-\n\nand training at each step of the design and implementation\n\nprocess.\n\n\n\nEthyl Corporation's Process Safety Manual is intended as a guide\n\nfor Ethyl facilities in the development of Process Safety\n\nManagement (PSM) Programs required by OSHA. The manual describes\n\neach required element of the PSM Program, its background policy,\n\nand program requirements. Policies and procedures for confined\n\nspace entry, process safety and contractor qualification\n\nprocedures, and incident investigation procedures are included.\n\nEach facility then develops its PSM Program based on this\n\nguidance. A corporate team audits the facility's compliance with\n\nthe PSM Program every three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2  Facility Policies\n\n\n\nBased upon the guidance offered by the corporate policies, Ethyl\n\nPetroleum Additives Natchez facility has developed site-specific\n\nenvironmental and safety programs and procedures to further ensure\n\nsafe operations. The facility's Hazard Communication program was\n\ndeveloped to provide employees with information on the chemical\n\nhazards of the workplace. With this awareness, employees can make\n\ninformed decisions when handling and processing the chemicals used\n\nat the facility. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) is required\n\nfor any new chemical introduced into the facility and is\n\naccessible to anyone requesting it. Containers holding hazardous\n\nchemicals are clearly labeled accordingly to protect employees.\n\nEmployees are trained on the potential hazards of the chemicals\n\nused in the workplace and offsite contractors are notified of the\n\nhazards present during orientation sessions.\n\n\n\nThe role of the facility's Chemical Hygiene Plan i"

The\n\nfacility employs approximately 40 people engaged in the production\n\nof motor oil and lubricating oil additives.\n\n\n\nThe processes involving the chemicals subject to the Risk\n\nManagement Program are the Sulfonation process and the Ammonia\n\nNeutralization process. In Sulfonation, alkylate (alphaolefin\n\nalkylbenzene) is mixed with oleum (20 percent fuming sulfuric\n\nacid) in an in-line static mixer where the alkylate is reacted\n\nwith sulfur trioxide to form sulfonic acid. Unreacted oleum is\n\nseparated from the sulfonic acid in settlers and returned to the\n\noleum producer for regeneration.\n\n\n\nIn Ammonia Neutralization, after the spent acid has been removed,\n\nthe sulfonic acid is treated (neutralized) with ammonia using an\n\nin-line static mixer to produce ammonium sulfonate. The ammonium\n\nsulfonate is a raw material in the petroleum additives production.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0  Regulated Substances Present\n\n\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, there are two substances\n\nused at the facility that are subject to the Risk Management\n\nProgram regulations. Oleum is stored and used at the facility with\n\na maximum inventory of 436,800 pounds. Ammonia is stored and used\n\nat the facility with a maximum inventory of 51,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0  Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, Ethyl\n\nPetroleum Additives determined the offsite impact of an accidental\n\nrelease for four release scenarios-a worst case release for each\n\nchemical and an alternate release scenario for each chemical.\n\n\n\nThe regulations define the worst case release for each chemical as\n\nthe loss of the entire maximum inventory over a 10-minute period.\n\nThe regulations require that the offsite impact of the worst case\n\nrelease be calculated using very conservative, worst case, weather\n\nconditions. Specifically, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an\n\nF atmospheric stability class."

      "SummaryText": " USEPA has published reference\n\ntables to be used in calculating the distance offsite that an\n\naccidental release would travel. These tables employ very\n\nconservative assumptions and therefore provide conservative\n\nestimates of the offsite distance that an accidental release would\n\ntravel. Ethyl Petroleum Additives used the USEPA reference tables\n\nto calculate a worst-case offsite impact radius of 0.43 miles for\n\noleum and 7.50 miles for ammonia. It is estimated that no\n\nresidential receptors would reside within the 0.43-mile radius of\n\nthe oleum release.\n\n\n\nEthyl Petroleum Additives also calculated offsite impact distances\n\nfor alternate, more realistic accidental release scenarios. These\n\nrelease scenarios took into consideration safety systems and\n\ncontrols in place to reduce the severity of an accidental release\n\nand considered a more realistic release rate of the hazardous\n\nchemicals. For oleum, overfilling the storage vessel was\n\ndetermined to be the most likely accidental release scenario even\n\nthough no serious accidental oleum releases have occurred at the\n\nfacility during the five-year accident history period. An oleum\n\noffsite impact radius of 0.19 miles was calculated using the USEPA\n\nreference tables and a quantity of 9,828 pounds released over a 10-\n\nminute period. It is estimated that no residential receptors would\n\nreside within the 0.19-mile radius of the oleum release.\n\n\n\nFor ammonia, a rupture disk or relief valve failure was the most\n\nlikely accidental release scenario even though no serious\n\naccidental ammonia releases have ever occurred at the facility. An\n\nammonia offsite impact radius of 0.31 miles was calculated using\n\nthe USEPA reference tables and a quantity of 500 pounds released\n\nover a 5-minute period. It is estimated that no residential\n\nreceptors would reside within the 0.31-mile radius of the ammonia\n\nrelease.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility's accident prevention program includes each of the\n\nelements "
