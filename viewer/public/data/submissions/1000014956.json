ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nHuisken Meats has a comprehensive approach to chemical safety.\nOur policies include:\n??A?    Safety team meetings that identify and address concerns in all areas of plant operations including release prevention and emergency response policies.\n??A?    Scheduled reviews of all crisis management plans.\n??A?    Safety reviews are a portion of quarterly Management Review Meetings.\n??A?    Voluntary participation and achievement of certification in MNSHARP program administered by Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry (OSHA).\n\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nThe Huisken Meat facility in Sauk Rapids, Minnesota is subject to the US EPA??A?s Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for beef processing and packaging.  The entire system contains approximately 20,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers and some piping are located outdoors.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Huisken Meats facility is a two-stage system consisting of a high-pressure side and a low-pressure side.  The low side (i.e., low pressure) is intended to quickly freeze product, while the high side (i.e., high pressure) is intended to refrigerate the product.  Equipment and piping carry the necessary gas, liquid, and saturated vapor throughout the system.\n\n\n3.    ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS    \n\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia.  To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention "

The key components of the prevention programs are summarized below:\n\n??A?    The development of an employee participation program, which includes employees from all areas within the plant.\n??A?    The development, documentation, and operator availability to critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment is used to facilitate the full understanding and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n??A?    A regular formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using ??A?HAZOP??A? Protection Analysis procedures.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\n??A?    Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n??A?    Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.\n??A?    Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are ??A?pre-qualified??A? based on their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  In addition, these contractors are periodica"

This includes regular inspection of major powered equipment, including compressors, pumps and large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechanical failure, and regular inspection and calibration of liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches and shutdown devices that have safety implications.\n??A?    Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent check confirms that changes made are consistent with the engineering design and in a safe operating condition prior to startup.\n??A?    Events that might cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent occurrence.\n??A?    Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must pre-approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\n??A?

Prevention program compliance audits performed every three years to verify that the appropriate management systems are in place and are being properly implemented.

Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for the vessels.\n\n5.    ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the Huisken Meats facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering, in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Huisken Meats facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and has a HAZWOPER team.  The ERP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia.\n\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nHuisken Meats continually investigates ways to improve our ammonia refrigeration processes by: \n??A?    Continual review of our PSM Process Hazard Analysis\n??A?    Additional training and drills of our HAZWOPER team.\n??A?    Greater integration of local HAZMAT response teams into our ERP plan.\n\n"
