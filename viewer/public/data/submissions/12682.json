EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Shell Chemical Company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Shell Chemical Company workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Shell Chemical Company has established systems to ensure safe operation of the facility.  One part of this system is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Shell Chemical Company.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Shell Chemical Company in Geismar, LA.\n\nThe dates provided for Prevention Program items in RMP Submit will generally be either 6/21/99 (RMP due date) or blank.  The reason for this is that although these process safety programs have been active under Process Safety Management (PSM), they have not been required under RMP until the 6/21/99 submittal and compliance date.  Therefore, placing any data in these fields that is before the RMP compliance date would not represent RMP compliance activities but activities that were performed for PSM compliance only.  Programs will be fully functional under RMP and PSM as of the 6/21/99 compliance date.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nShell Chemical Company implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel respond to control and contain such releases as appropriate.  Each situation is evaluated individually and appropriate measures are taken to protect the employees and the community.  Shell C"

      "SummaryText": "hemical Company, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and neighboring industry have established a program to warn the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.  A local siren warning system is in place and tested routinely.\n\n1.2 The Shell Chemical Company and Regulated Substances\n\nShell Chemical Company handles many substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  The information below indicates the processes as defined by the rule and the regulated substances therein:\n\n- AOID-1&2 - Alpha and internal olefin production - Program 3:   1-butene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans, ethane, methane, ethylene, 1-pentene, propylene, and chlorine.\n\n- EOEG - Ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol production - Program 3:  methane, ethylene, and ethylene oxide.\n\n- K-2/3/4 - Detergent range alcohol production - Program 1:  Hydrogen.\n\n- PDO-1 - 1,3-propanediol production - Program 3:  Acetaldehyde, hydrogen, methane, and ethylene oxide.\n\n- PK-1 - Polyketones production - Program 3:  Propylene and ethylene\n\n- Utilities Chlorine and Ammonia - Chlorine and ammonia used in water treatment processes in the Utilities system - Program 3:  Ammonia and chlorine\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nShell Chemical Company performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Shell Chemical Company does not expect a worst case scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of the facility like Shell Chemical Company.  ARSs help the LEPC improve the community response plan.  Below is a summary of the WCSs and ARSs for the Shell Chemical Geismar facility.\n\n- Worst Case (Program 3 processes)  Toxics / Ethylene Oxide:  375,000 lb EO storage vessel - gas release -  (adm"

All other cases, worst and alternate, do not encompass any residential areas or institutions in their potential radius of impact.  For these scenarios, only other industrial sites are impacted.  \n\nRadii of potential impact for all release scenarios were determined using guidance in the RMP rule and the lookup tables from the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document, dated May 24, 1996.\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place for the Program 3 processes at the Shell Chemical Company Geismar Plant.  Because the processes at the Shell Chemical plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments and individuals in the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A database summarizing the data elements of process safety information, the responsible party, and their location is maintained by the HSEGT Process Safety Committee.  This is available to employees as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Shell Chemical Company Geismar Plant  has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Geismar plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Shell Chemical Geismar periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at the specified frequency until the process ceases to operate.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Shell Chemical Geismar plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operation such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shell Chemical Geismar has implemented a  training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

Initial and refresher training records for each employee involved in operating a covered process are maintained in the Shell Training and Recordkeeping System (TRIM), which is maintained by the Training Section of the Human Resources Department.  Contract employees are not involved in operating covered processes.  Training records include the name of the employee and the date of the training.  Where applicable, copies of tests and other means used to verify that the employee understood the training are maintained.  The training places an emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the job.  \n\nContractors\nThe Shell Chemical Company uses contractors regularly and to supplement the workforce during periods of high activity.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Shell Chemical Company has procedures in place to ensure contractors have the proper knowledge of and training on plant systems, procedures, and processes before they go to work at the site.  Safety performance constitutes a major factor in the overall evaluation of contractor performance and  Shell performs periodic evaluations of contractor compliance with Shell and regulatory requirements.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nShell Chemical Company conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, all major projects, major turnarounds, and minor turnarounds require a PSSR to be performed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team creat"
