      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCreekstone Farms is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, the Fire Departments's emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We have met with the fire department and they have toured the facility which provides additional emergency response expertise and familiarity with the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the slaughter of cattle and processing of meat from the carcasses.   Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA \"RMP*COMP\" as well as the EPA \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\".  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the "

The hazard analysis was undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Creekstone Farms maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nCreekstone Farms has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nCreekstone Farms carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, air units, heat exchangers, evaporative condensers, compressors, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, and controls.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a background in maintenance practices.  Training is provided to the personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Cha"

      "SummaryText": "nge\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Creekstone Farms to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in the established process are conducted as a regular practice at Creekstone Farms.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCreekstone Farms conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCreekstone Farms promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nCreekstone Farms truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Creekstone Farms has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nCreekstone Farms has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nIn  the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is the facility's policy to notify the Cowley County Emergency Management Agency and request they respond to the emergency,. The facility has discussed this policy with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The facility has an Emergency Repose Plan which is called the Emergency Action plan (EAP). The EAP describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of an anhydrous  ammonia accidental release. Aspects of emergency response include adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notifications of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post incident procedures for anhydrous ammonia exposure, and the procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the EAP. A general practice drill is performed at least annually. A site map, SDSs, and list of chemicals are kept alongside the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Continued training, and program reviews are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented in a timely manner.\n\n"
