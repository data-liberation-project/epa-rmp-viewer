Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Great Lakes Chemical, South Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We are also completely coordinated with Union County Arkansas LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass organic and inorganic chemical synthesis.  We have 9 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include ammonia, bromine,  chlorine, ethylene [ethene], hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid [hydrofluoric acid], oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) [sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide], propylene oxide [oxirane, methyl-], sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), and sulfur trioxide.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Ammonia is used for acid adjustment and neutralization.  Bromine is used for chemical synthesis.  Chlorine is used for bromine replacement.  Ethylene  [Ethene] is used for chemical synthesis.  Hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid [hydrofluoric acid] is used for chemical synthesis. Oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) [sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] is used for chemical synthesis.  Propylene oxide [oxirane, methyl-] is used for chemical synthesis. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for chemical synthesis.   "

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in RMP Comp.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in RMP Comp.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of two railroad tank cars (360,000 lbs.) of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, a distance of  some miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the ethylene storage tank in the Fluorine Chemical unit process.  The scenario involves the release of one storage tank of ethylene  [ethene].  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.
