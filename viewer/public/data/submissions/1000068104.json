      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION \r\n\r\nChoctaw County Generating Station is a natural gas-fired, electric power generating station located near French Camp, Mississippi. This 192-acre facility is located 1.5 miles west of French Camp, MS and 90 miles northeast of Jackson, MS, near the intersection of Highway 407 and the Natchez Trace Parkway. \r\n \r\nThe station currently employs approximately 18 full-time staff and a few contract employees. The facility was constructed and began operations in 2003, but went into \"mothball\" status in 2004. The facility returned to commercial operation status in 2007 and has remained in operation since that time.\r\n \r\nThe facility generates 844 MW of power from three natural-gas fired turbines. Each turbine unit is equipped with a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. The SCRs employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program. The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is a 30% solution of ammonia in water. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this facility was originally incorrectly classified as a Program 2 facility. During the course of the 2008 5-year renewal, it was determined that the facility should be classified as a Program 1 facility. No changes were made to the aqueous ammonia process to necessitate this change, and no changes have been made to the aqueous ammonia process since the 2008 RMP renewal. The facility continues to keep the public informed on the facility's prevention and protection efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE \r\n\r\nCorporate policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \r\n\r\na. PRIMARY ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThis facility is a natural gas-f"

      "SummaryText": "ired, electric power generating station. \r\n\r\nb. USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia injection system at Choctaw County Generating Station is designed to remove NOx from boiler flue gas by SCR. This is accomplished by injecting an approximately 30% ammonia solution into the flue gas.\r\n\r\nNo other toxic or flammable materials are stored at the facility in quantities above the RMP regulatory threshold. \r\n\r\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system prevention program includes the following components: \r\n\r\n- The ammonia storage tank is built to exacting standard;\r\n\r\n- Ammonia tank trucks will only by unloaded according to plant safety procedures;\r\n\r\n- Administrative controls are in place to ensure that the tank is not filled beyond 85% of its capacity;\r\n\r\n- The storage tank is located in a concrete diked area for secondary containment.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\n\r\nNo accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 have occurred during the past five years at this site. \r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe Choctaw Generating Station is classified as a Program 1 facility, and the facility coordinates with the community emergency response plan.  Any additional information requested by the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) for development and implementation of the community plan must be provided by the facility.  The French Camp Volunteer Fire Department would provide the first EMT response to the facility.\r\n\r\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \r\n\r\nAll station safety programs, including the emergency response program, are reviewed periodically for improvement opportunities. There are no planned changes to the system at this time."
