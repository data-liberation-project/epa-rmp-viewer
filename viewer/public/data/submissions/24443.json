Using the EPA OCA look up tables and stipulated alternative weather conditions (wind speed of 3.0 m/sec and D stability class), the ammonia vapors are basically contained within the warehouse and do cause any potential  impact to public receptors.\n\nThe selected alternative release scenario for hydrochloric acid is also a drum failure resulting in release of 55 gallons (525 pounds) of 37% HCl inside the warehouse storage area.  A 55 gallon drum is the largest, single container of this product managed on site. Chemical release to the atmosphere is not instantaneous but volatilization from the liquid pool will occur.  Using the EPA OCA look up tables and stipulated alternative weather conditions, it was calculated that HCl vapors would be localized on site and not impact any public receptors.\n\nThe above information is being used to help us ensure that our Emergency Response Plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.  There were no listed environmental receptors impacted by any of the alternative release scenarios. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA systematic, proactive approach is taken to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  To minimize the chance of an release with offsite implications, Arch Chemicals has six layers of safety and environmental protection; our employees, mechanical integrity programs, hazard reviews, process controls, monitoring systems and emergency response.  \n\nEmployees: Well trained employees are our most important resource in operating our facilities and in protecting the community.  \nMechanical Integrity: This comprehensive inspection and testing program for operating equipment provides more reliable and well-maintained equipment, which greatly reduces the pro"

Hazard Reviews identify things that could possibly go wrong so that these situations can be corrected and controlled before an incident occurs.\nProcess Controls:  The Mesa Facility has a variety of back-up systems which provide precise control of processes and maintain tight operating parameters.\nMonitoring Systems:  Product sensing detectors immediately identify any potential problems, giving operators an early warning which enables them to provide a quicker and more effective response.\nEmergency Response:  The Mesa Facility Emergency Response program is describe in a later Section of this Executive Summary.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program along with the chemical specific prevention actions work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nInvestigation records are maintained for all incidents that occur at our facility.  We have had nine (9) accidental releases of hydrofluoric acid in the last five years that require reporting under the RMP rule.  The largest of these experienced since the 1996 start up of the facility was a 500 pound release of 55% liquid hydrofluoric acid.  As a result of these releases, injuries that required medical attention occurred to eight on site employees and one contract employee.  None of the injuries had any long term effects on the individual.  None of the incidents had an off site impact.\n\nFor each of these incidents, we have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the unlikely event of a major spill or release, the Site Emergency Response Te"

Our emergency response plan (ERP) addresses the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency planning, providing the essential elements for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  \n\nTo assist us in the event of an emergency, local area emergency responders have been provided with our ERP.  Facility Response Team members are on site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  These highly trained employees are experienced in Chemical Emergency Response, as well as Advanced First Aid.  On site drills and training are conducted on a regular basis.\n\nThe City of Mesa Fire Department is responsible for notifying the public of any release which has potential off-site impacts.  The Arch Chemicals Mesa Facility continues to work with the Fire Department in evaluating alert system options to assist in improving the timeliness of the current notification process.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPlanned facility improvements whose implementation will help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment include:\n(1) Installation of a water deluge system over the bulk tanks/bulk unloading area to maximize our ability to contain acid vapors from potential releases within the area.\n(2) Providing a 'more timely' alert system for neighboring residents than the current City door to door notification process.\n\nIn addition, plans are being made to initiate regular joint onsite emergency drills/training between the City of Mesa Fire Department and Hazmat Teams and Arch Chemicals Emergency Response Team members."

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt the Arch Chemicals Mesa facility, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  As a company, we are committed to excellence in health, safety and the environment.    \n\nThe Mesa facility is committed to The Goal is Zero initiative, striving to achieve zero recordable injuries, zero environmental incidents, zero manufacturing process incidents, and zero distribution incidents.  The same dedication to excellence marks our Product Stewardship initiative, under which we address health, safety and environmental performance throughout our products' life cycles.  Product Stewardship and The Goal is Zero initiatives not only make good ethical and moral sense, but they respond to what our customers want and our communities expect: that we operate in a safe and environmentally sound manner.\n\nThe following sections provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities designed and implemented at the Mesa facility. \n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nArch Chemicals Mesa facility processes and supplies ultra high purity chemicals to the semiconductor and silicon wafer industries.  Products include acids, etchants, solvents and custom blend formulations. Due to recent business changes, the Mesa facility has discontinued manufacture of ammonium hydroxide solutions.  Hydrochloric acid is also no longer distilled and packaged on site. These  processes were covered by our initial Risk Management Plan submittal.  Warehouse storage volumes of ammonium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid packaged products have also been reduced by at least 70% since our intial Plan submittal. Current operations use the following toxic chemicals identif"

A maximum 67,200 pounds is stored on site at the facility.\nAmmonia solutions (>20%) are stored on site prior to distribution to customers; maximum inventory is 45,000 pounds (on a 100% basis).\nHydrofluoric acid (>=50%) is received as a raw material. distilled, diluted to <50% concentration or blended with other acids/etchants prior to packaging.  A maximum 232,000 pounds (100% basis) are handled/stored on site at regulated concentrations.\nHydrochloric acid (>=37%) is also stored for distribution to customers.  A maximum 52,800 pounds (on a 100% basis) could be stored on site at any one time.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.  There are no RMP-regulated flammable chemicals handled or stored at/above threshold quantities at the Mesa facility.\n\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  For regulated toxic chemicals, one worst case scenario having the overall greatest endpoint distance along with an alternative scenario for each toxic chemical must be reported.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios and our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental releases.  Information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances are provided where pertinent.  Complete details of release quantities and distances these materials could travel before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public is provided in Section 3 of the RMPlan.  \n\nWorst-case Rele"

      "SummaryText": "ase Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nThe selected worst case release scenario assumes failure of the storage tank containing 67,200 pounds of pure anhydrous ammonia.  Company procedures limit the maximum storage volume to 86.5% of tank capacity.  The default assumption is that the entire contents of the tank are released over a 10 minute period to the concrete below.  Upon release, the pressurized liquid forms a pool and vaporizes to gaseous ammonia.  Using the EPA OCA look up tables and EPA stipulated weather conditions (wind speed of 1.5 m/sec and F atmospheric stability class), potentially impacted public receptors include the Queen Creek schools, area residences and neighboring industries.  The latest census data used to estimate population within the potentially impacted area was doubled due to recent residential development to the northeast. There are no EPA listed environmental receptors within the impact distance.  Although unrealistic, this scenario meets the requirements of release of the largest quantity from a vessel and has the farthest potential off site impact.  Other than administrative controls to limit storage volume, no other passive mitigation measures were considered in modeling of this scenario to limit the exposure distances.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nThe more likely alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the shearing of a pipe from the bottom of the ammonia storage tank.  Liquid ammonia (37,600 pounds) is released into the diked area.  Surface gaseous emissions from the liquid pool are reduced once ammonia flows into a second,  smaller below grade containment area.  Using the EPA OCA look up tables and stipulated alternative weather conditions (wind speed of 3.0 m/sec and D stability class), potentially impacted public receptors includes the neighboring residential population and employees at the MPC Chemicals, Southwest Polytek, and TRW industrial facilities.  There were no active mitiga"

Protective barriers were installed to minimize occurrence of this type of incident.\n\nTwo alternative release scenarios are presented for hydrofluoric acid (HF); one for 70% HF and a second for 55% HF.  Hydrofluoric acid (70%) delivered in bulk tank trucks is immediately diluted to 55% when unloaded.  In the first scenario, it is assumed that a 2-inch unloading hose is sheared at the tank truck while unloading the 70% HF.  Liquid HF spills to the diked storage tank containment area (passive mitigation).  The containment area and the unloading bay are under a 40 foot roof.  The release is isolated using the emergency button located at front and rear of the trailer.  This button  closes the unloading valve.  Using the EPA OCA look up tables and stipulated alternative weather conditions (wind speed of 3.0 m/sec and D stability class), it was calculated that HF vapors potentially impact employees of  MPC Chemicals located immediately adjacent to the south property line and, based on the latest census data available, approximately 24 residential neighbors .  No active mitigation measures were considered to limit exposure distances in the modeling of this scenario.\n\nThe second release scenario for hydrofluoric acid is overflow of the bulk 55% HF storage tank into the secondary containment area.  The operator stops the transfer pump and water is added to minimize acid fumes.  Chemical release to the atmosphere is not instantaneous but volatilization from the liquid pool will occur.  Using the EPA OCA look up tables and stipulated alternative weather conditions (wind speed of 3.0 m/sec and D stability class), potentially impacted public receptors is limited to MPC Chemicals located immediately adjacent to the Mesa Facilities south property line. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonium hydroxide (ammonia solutions >= 20% concentration) is a packaging failure which results in the re"
