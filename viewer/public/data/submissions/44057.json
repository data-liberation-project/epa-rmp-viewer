We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the public, as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the Environmental     Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation\n\n\n\n?

Sewage treatment is not a part of plant operations. The plant handles one RMP-regulated toxic substance above the EPA threshold quantity, which is chlorine.

      "SummaryText": "t the treatment plant\n\nChlorine is delivered to our plant and stored in 1-ton (\"ton\") containers and is fed to the process from two of the containers at a time. The container storage room area can hold up to 4 one-ton containers. Two containers are connected to the same feed piping manifold at a time. An alternate supply arrangement consists of two additional ton containers connected to a parallel, but normally isolated, feed piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a liquid to chlorine evaporators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the chlorinators into the water stream. Currently we store the reserve containers of chlorine outside. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS?s can be used to help the Cabell/Wayne (local) Emergency Planning Committee (C/WEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with C/WEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses. For these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occur. In all cases, if such events occur, we would activate our emerg"

The paragraphs below briefly describe the scenarios we have included in our risk management plan (RMPlan), including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures we have put in place to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\n        Worst-case Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\n\n\n    The worst case scenario at our water treatment facility involves a failure of a ton         container holding approximately 2000 lbs of liquefied chlorine gas under             pressure, resulting in a release with vaporization of the entire contents of the         container. In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid outdoors         of our water treatment building. Since this facility is located in a populated area,         the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points     and nearby public receptors.\n\n    \n\n        Currently, the Huntington Water Treatment Plant is under construction of a new             State-of-the-art facility including a chlorine feed/storage area. The new                 facility will contain a chlorine scrubber among other updated controls and                 computerization. This construction is scheduled to be complete by December             1999. Therefore, the results of the worst case and alternate case scenarios are             based upon current operating conditions and not the new facility upgrades due to             be complete in December, 1999.\n\n\n\n    Numerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and     should one occur, to provide for effective emergency response. Controls include         container design, storage, operation, maintenance and inspection; container repair         and emergency response equipment; and personnel training conducted in             accordance with regulatory requirements, chlorine industry standards and             practices, and our company?s corporate policies and procedures"

      "SummaryText": ", which are strictly     enforced at the water treatment plant.\n\n\n\n    Alternative Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\n\n\n    Our alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a chlorine release of             approximately 4000 lbs through a broken flexible connection (\"pigtail\") between         either of two connected chlorine containers and a common supply manifold in the         liquid piping to our chlorine feed system. A break in a pigtail connecting one of         the containers to the piping manifold will permit both connected containers to         vent their respective contents (about 2000 lbs each) through the open ends of the         severed pigtail. Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for         the partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which         mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of         chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a populated     area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end         points and nearby public receptors.\n\n\n\n    As in the WCS, we have taken a very conservative approach to determining the         ARS endpoint distance off-site. Therefore, in determining the ARS endpoint         distance we have not taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered         safeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors. The chlorine leak detection         system is calibrated to    initiate alarms at very low concentrations of chlorine (i.e.,         lower than industry recommended settings). Some of our additional engineering         safeguards are     outlined in the following section of this summary and include         isolation valves. Isolation valves are provided in the downstream chlorine feed         system to isolate downstream chlorine sources from the pigtail leak.  As stated in         the description of the WCS, numerous administrative controls are in place to         prevent a release of this type and to provide effective emergency response should         one occur.\n\n\n\n    We are using this informat"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. The program consists of procedures for responding to a chlorine release. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including (1) proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for human exposures, (2) facility evacuation plans and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation, (3) notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and (4) post-incident follow-up requirements. Procedures are in place governing the establishment of the plant's Emergency Operation Center where management personnel can direct and control emergency operations on an as-needed basis.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant facilities or to the chlorine storage and feed process, or when improvement benefits are recognized. Affected personnel are informed about, and trained on, the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the C/WEPC - the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) having jurisdiction in Cabell and Wayne Counties - and with Cabell County and City of Huntington, West Virginia, emergency management officials.
