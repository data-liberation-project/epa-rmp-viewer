The total amount of chlorine dioxide released is 1440 pounds.  The chlorine dioxide concentration is based on the acceptable operating range of 9.5 to 11.5 g/L.  The release rate from the liquid pool was modeled using the Kawamura-Mackay evaporation model, modified to account for the changing concentration of chlorine dioxide in the remaining liquid.  The release was then modeled using the DEGADIS dispersion model for dense gas releases.  The maximum distance to the toxic end point concentration (2.8 mg/m3) is 1.66  miles.  Approximately 21 people live within this distance of the mill, as estimated using the U.S. Census Bureau's LANDVIEW3 software.  Additionally, the Columbia River is located within this distance of the release.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBoise Cascade keeps records of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at the Wallula mill. This history indicates a good record of accidental release prevention over the past five years.  No releases of Chlorine or Chlorine Dioxide have occurred from Boise Cascade that have resulted in consequences of interest (i.e., deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known deaths, injuries, evacations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site). The Wallula Mill continues to stress the importance of safety and  achieving no reportable incidents within its next five-year accident history.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn addition to the prevention program, Boise Cascade maintains a written integrated emergency response plan to safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. The plan identifies personnel roles at the mill for handling the emergency, provides emergency recognition and prevention information, includes procedures for evacuation area shutdowns, includes important community res"

The Wallula mill handles one or more regulated substances listed in Appendix A of Part 68.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nBoise Cascade owns and operates a pulp and paper mill located in Wallula Washington, which is an existing major stationary source per the requirements of Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The regulated substances handled by this facility are chlorine and chlorine dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\n\nThe Wallula mill uses the kraft and neutral sulfite semi-chemical (NSSC) pulping processes to produce pulp and paper from wood chips.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide, both regulated substances under the Risk Management Program, are used at the mill to bleach the pulp.  Paper, the final product of the mill, is made from bleached pulp.\n\nChlorine is brought onto the mill site by railcar; up to four railcars of chlorine may be present at the mill at any time.  The maximum amount of chlorine that is stored at the site is 720,000 pounds.  \n\nChlorine dioxide is generated at the mill using the R-8 generation process.  Chlorine dioxide is stored in an aqueous solution in two 272,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum amount of chlorine dioxide that is stored in the tanks is 52,220 pounds.\n\nBoise also stores the following listed chemicals on-site, in quantities below the RMP thresholds for each process:  aqueous ammonia, propane, hydrochloric acid,  acetylene, and Chlorine for process water treatment.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nBoise Cascade takes a systematic, proact"
