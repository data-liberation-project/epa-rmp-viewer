      "SummaryText": "The City of Marion disinfects the potable  water supply prior to introduction of the water into the distribution system.  This disinfection is accomplished by the injection of a chlorine solution at various points in the water treatment process.   The chlorine solution is produced by passing gaseous chlorine into a water stream using chlorinators with vacuum regulators and injectors.  The gas chlorine is stored as a gas liquified by pressure in multiple 1-ton cylinders.  No  more than four (4) 1-ton cylinders are maintained on-site at any time.  Typically one or  more  of the  stored cylinders are empty and an additional cylinder is partially empty at all times.\n\n The facility has a written Emergency Response Plan . The written plan contains appropriate and up-to-date information. All city personnel are trained to the awareness level during orientation and all personnel get an in-depth knowledge of the hazards of the system before assigned operator duties. Maintenance and changing of the chlorine ton cylinders are done only on first shift. The SOP stresses that there will be at least two operators and the truck driver on site during the complete delivery cycle. Method of changing is documented and specific. The plant does not have a hazmat team. In the event of a leak the local hazmat team would be called in.\n\n "
