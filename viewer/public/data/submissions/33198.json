The Los Angeles Cold Storage safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.\tContinue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.\tContinue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.\tContinue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

Los Angeles Cold Storage maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. Los Angeles Cold Storage has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Program Element Binder Section 12. document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Los Angeles Cold Storage facility is located at 400 South Central Avenue in Los Angeles, California.  Highway 101 is approximately one mile to the north and to the east of the facility, the Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10) is 1.2 miles to the south, and the Harbor freeway (Highway 110) is 1.8 miles to the west.  The facility is located in downtown Los Angeles, and the area immediately surrounding the facility is residential and commercial.  The system and the facility were constructed in accordance with the most recently adopted Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Los Angeles Cold Storage facility refrigeration system. The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.
