      "SummaryText": "As a good neighbor, Farmer's Grain & Supply is committed to keeping the community safe.  We comply with all Federal and State standards regarding anhydrous ammonia storage.\nThe Farmer's Grain facility located at 1313 S. Colony, Union Grove, WI, complies with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Farmer's Grain's emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the local fire authority and police department, as well as the Racine LEPC.  The telephone numbers for the previously named public services are posted on an emergency board in plain sight in case of an emergency.\nAt the facility located in Union Grove, WI, anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed for resale to farmers.  The anhydrous is received by truck and stored in a 30,000 gallon tank.  It is distributed for direct application.  The maximum amount stored at this facility is 130,000 pounds (30,000 gallons times 5.1 pounds per gallon times 85%).\nWorst case scenario is a gas release of 130,000 pounds due to a tank rupture.  The anhydrous ammonia would be released as a gas for a 10 minute period at at rate of 13,000 pounds per minute.  Under urban conditions the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles (using the RMP Comp model).\nAlternative scenario is a transfer hose failure causing a 5% release of 6,500 pounds (2,000 pounds per minute for 2 minutes).  The release being stopped by human interaction.  Under urban conditions the distance to the endpoint is .3 miles.\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have resulted in any deaths, injuries, or property damage on or off site.\nSafety, both to the community and our employees, is an ongoing process at the facility.  Planned periodic maintenance evaluations are done to ensure that safe conditions and equipment are in use."
