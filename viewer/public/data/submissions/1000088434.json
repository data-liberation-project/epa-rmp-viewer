The risk management plan (RMP) incorporates the release prevention, emergency response, and training provisions of both the owner and operator, since these two entities coordinate implementation of on-site procedures to ensure that employees are properly prepared to prevent and respond to emergencies.\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description\n\n\n\nThis source is a 2 million gallon per day municipal utility district south water treatment plant (water supply) that provides potable water for subdivisions and development along Southwest Parkway.  One of the components of the treatment plant is disinfection of the water by chlorination.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe only regulated substance present at this facility is chlorine gas, which is delivered in one-ton cylinders.\n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios \n\n \n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance was used to determine worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The model RMP*Comp was used with default weather conditions for worst case and alternative conditions.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures\n\nTravis County MUD No. 4 south water treatment plant is subject to the requirements of Occupational Safety and Health Standards, 29 CFR ? 1910.38 and 1910.120, and this site qualifies as a Program 3 RMP submittal. It is the policy of the MUD and Crossroads Utility Services to fully comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) standards and Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulations regarding the storage and use of hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nNo engineered passive controls are in place for a chlorine release from this site.  Active controls consist of chlorine "

Crossroads Utility Services has emergency equipment and a leak repair kit.  A self-contained breathing apparatus is kept at the facility for use by personnel responding to a leak.  There are emergency procedures in place for stopping leaks and for notification of local authorities and emergency response teams. \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases at this site resulting in injuries or property damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nUpon discovery of a leak by an employee or local resident report or via the chlorine gas monitor/alarm system, Crossroads Utility Services notifies the local chlorine response team and the facility operator.  On-site response time is 30 minutes or less.  If the response team determines that 10 pounds of chlorine have been released, or if there is a potential health or off-site health threat, the proper authorities are notified immediately.  The response team will also take immediate steps to shutdown the system and stop/repair the source of the release.\n\n\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nNo changes to improve the safety of this site are currently pending or being implemented.  There are no recommended changes at this time.\n\n"
