Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThis facility handles liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) and sometimes butane, above threshold quantities.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle LPG and LNG, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.  Our policy is to have only trained personnel handle the materials.  Personnel are trained to follow safe handling procedures at all times.\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with input from the Costa Mesa Fire Department and Police Department.  We conduct regular joint training and walk through inspections with the Fire Department to ensure communication and coordination.  Our policy is to work with the Fire Department during any type of emergency at this facility.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nJ. C. Carter Company operates under several divisions, one of which is the Industrial Marine Division.  This division manufactures, assembles and tests submerged liquefied gas pumps.  The tests are conducted using LPG or LNG, along with nitrigen (LN2).  The Industrial Marine test slab is the area of focus for the RMP.  \n\nLPG and LNG are the regulated substances handled above threshold quantities.   LPG is stored in an 8,000 gallon above ground tank.  LNG is stored in one of two 13,000 gallon above ground tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and contractors only.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nAs required by EPA, the worst case release scenario at the facility is a total release of LPG due to a failure of the storage tank.  An alternative release scenario is a fireball from a BLEVE at the propane tank.  These scen"

The probability of such a worst case scenario actually happening is very low.  \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility was designed and constructed in accordance with general safety standards, such as NFPA, Compressed Gas Association safe handling practices, Uniform Fire Code and other generally accepted practices.\n\nFire prevention is accomplished by posting signs for authorized access and no smoking.  The facility has a water sprinkler deluge system constructed around the tanks, which is activated by an ultraviolet monitoring system to prevent fire from affecting the storage tanks.  All valves have backup valves in case one fails.  This redundancy provides safety in the mechanical operation of the system.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years that resulted in deaths, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nEmergency procedures are documented in the J. C. Carter Emergency Plan.  The fluids are transfered from one tank or tanker to another only during normal business hours.  Personnel would be on site to handle an emergency and to contact outside agencies should it become necessary.  Training has been conducted facility wide.  Evacuation drills are conducted annually.  The Costa Mesa Fire Department is aware of the emergency procedures and hazardous materials on site.  Joint training is also conducted with the fire department.  There is a security guard on duty 24 hours to oversee the facility and to notify authorities in case of an emergency after normal business hours.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThis facility has been operating in the same basic manner for over 30 years.  This facility was origin"
