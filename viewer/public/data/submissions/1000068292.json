The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including response to a regulated substance release including the possibility of a fire or explosion in the event a flammable substance is accidently released. Procedures incorporate evacuation routes and practice, methods for personnel headcounts, and company and agency notification. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or facility. The overall emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders including local law enforcement and the Weld County Emergency Management.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nField personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety at production facilities. This is done through training, which is a vital part of any safety program. Training is conducted according to a reoccurring schedule and employees and contractors are given the most up-to-date information available. All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices."

      "SummaryText": "nd natural gas production facility, designed to produce oil and gas before being removed from the site for additional processing. The facility consists of three-phase separation, oil and water tanks, mechanical gas refrigeration, gas compression and pressurized liquids storage, as well as all associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are extracted from the natural gas and stored on site. The extracted NGLs include ethane, propane, butane and a pentane natural gasoline mixture delivered to market via transportation vehicles.  NGLs and natural gas are the regulated substances handled in this facility. The facility is classified as Program Level 1 under the regulation. There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is a release of a flammable mixture resulting in a failure of the 18,000-gallon NGL storage vessel releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere having an offsite impact. The equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule, further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP*Comp&trade; was used to calculate the release scenario. The worst case release method for a flammable mixture, the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi, was used in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nEmployees have been trained in an over view of the process as well as operating and maintenance procedures pertinent to their job duties.  Additionally, personnel are trained in appropriate safe work practices which apply to the process and facility per corporate safety guidelines.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations consistent with industry practice and to meet regulatory requirements. Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confin"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe Mustang 44-22 Production Facility, located in Weld County, Colorado, is owned and operated by Bonanza Creek Energy Operating Company, LLC (Bonanza Creek). Bonanza Creek is committed to safety and environmental excellence.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them. As a company, Bonanza Creek follows a close adherence to applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about Bonanza Creek's operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, and 5 year accident history.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nBonanza Creek Energy Operating Company is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors working in the facility, our neighbors and the surrounding community and the environment. This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our facility.  Bonanza Creek implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The facility has not had nor does it anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release. However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, Bonanza Creek personnel, in cooperation with local agencies, are trained to respond, minimize and eliminate any exposure which would occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Mustang 44-22 Production facility is located near Kersey, Colorado. It is an up-stream oil a"
