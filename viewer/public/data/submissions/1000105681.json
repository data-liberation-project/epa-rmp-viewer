If an accidental release should occur, this facility has a trained on-site hazmat team including proper equipment (SCBA, response kits, and recovery vessel) to respond.  This facility has also conducted meetings, training sessions, table-top exercises and full-scale exercises with the local emergency planning committee and hazardous materials responders (Clinton County Special Emergency Association) and the Camanche Local Volunteer Fire Department to ensure everyone is aware of the hazards at this site.\n\nPlanned Changes:  While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than to continue compliance with industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to Think Safe!

This starts with DOT approved containers that are robustly designed to contain chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) through expected conditions during transportation and storage.
