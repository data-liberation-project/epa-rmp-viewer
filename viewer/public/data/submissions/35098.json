The plaza is located in the Borough of Norvelt, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.  The regulated substance is an 18,000-gallon propane tank that is used for comfort heat and fuel for both a glass melting furnace and a spray dryer.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Norvelt Busniess:  The Norvelt Business Plaza complies with all NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas Storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency did occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Norvelt Fire Department and request that they immediately respond to the situation at hand.\n\nThe worst-case nad alternative release scenarios:  Our worst-cast scenario is the complete failure of the 18,000-gallon propane tank.  At the NFPA capacity limit of 88%, this tank will contain a maximum of 66,528 pounds of propane.  This release would result in a vapor cloud explosion with and off-site endpoint of 0.3 miles.  Public receptors are within the endpoint of this scenario.  The alternate release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter pipe, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion.  The resulting endpoint extends off-site , and public receptors are within the endpoint of 0.2 miles.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  The Norvelt Business Plaza complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 codes and state laws.\n\nFive-year accident history:  Norvelt Business Plaza has never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving the propane system, it is the polic"
