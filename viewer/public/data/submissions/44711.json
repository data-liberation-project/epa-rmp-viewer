      "SummaryText": "The City of Ardmore operates a Wastewater treatment Plant (Facility) located at 3600 Sutton Road in Ardmore, Oklahoma.  The Facility treats wastewater prior to flowing into Sand Creek.  The Facility uses one (1) regulated substance (chlorine) above the threshold quantity of the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68).  Facilities that use or store any toxic or flammable substances listed in 40 CFR 68.130 above the specified threshold quantities in a process, are required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program enforced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Facility has implemented a Risk Management Program to help prevent an accidental release of chlorine that could potentially cause harm to the public and/or the environment, and to mitigate the severity of any release that does occur.  The Risk Management Program includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program. \n\nThe Facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that has caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the chlorine system, the Facility's emergency action plan requires an immediate evacuation of the Facility and immediate notification of the Ardmore Fire Department.  The Ardmore Fire Department will be responsible for responding to the emergency and directing any required public evacuation or sheltering in place.  The Facility has discussed this Emergency Response Plan with the Ardmore Fire Department and members of the Ardmore Fire Department have inspected the Facility.  They Ardmore Fire Department is equipped with self- contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) that would enable them to enter the Chlorine Room and work to mitigate a chlorine release.\n\nThe Facility has implemented the Risk Management Program's Level 3 Release Prevention Program.

      "SummaryText": "this program the Facility has compiled process safety information and performed a process hazard analysis, developed and implemented written operating procedures, and trained the employees that operate or maintain the chlorine system.  The Facility has also implemented maintenance and inspection procedures to ensure the mechanical integrity of the chlorine system's equipment.  Prior to implementing any change to the chlorine system, a management of change procedure will be adhered to including a pre startup review of the chlorine system.  The Facility will perform a compliance audit every three (3) years and will investigate all actual releases and any incident that could have resulted in a release.  The Facility has involved its employees in the development of the Facility's Risk Management Program.  The Facility requires the use of hot work permits involving any welding or other heat generating work either on or near to the chlorine system, and has implemented procedures for training of contractors and verifying contractor's qualifications.  \n\nAn off site consequence analysis was performed for one worst-case scenario and one alternate case scenario."
