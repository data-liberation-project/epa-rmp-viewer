ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nPhillips 66 Company has a long standing commitment to the environment and to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, written procedures, routine maintenance and inspection programs, and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release should occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nII.    DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Sweeny Unit 44 NGL Fractionator 1 is a fractionation and treating facility to provide a nominal 100,000 BPD of NGL fractionation capacity. The facility consists of amine treating, dehydration, fractionation and product sulfur treating equipment to provide upgrading of Y-grade natural gas liquids to ethane, propane, n-butane, i-butane and C5+ gasoline products.\n\n\n\nThe Sweeny Unit 46.1 Export Propane Unit (EPU) receives HDS Propane containing 3.5-7 LV% ethane and fractionates it to lower its ethane content to less than 2 LV% and produces Deethanized Propane (DEP). The unit also produces ethane with a propane content of less than 3.5 LV%. The units nominal feed capacity is 100,000 BPD.\n\n\n\nThe Deethanized Propane (DEP) product stream from Unit 46.1 EPU is combined with the Frac Propane Product (FPP) stream from Unit 44 NGL Frac 1 and fed into the Unit 46.2 Desulfurization Unit in order to reduce the carbonyl sulfide (COS) content to less than 5 ppmw (as sulfur) and the total sulfur content to less than 30 ppmw and produce Export Grade Propane (EGP). The unit nominal feed capacity is 132,000 BPD. \n\n\n\nThe Sweeny Unit 47 NGL Fractionator 2 is a fractionation and treating facility to pr"

The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. The ARS represents a more credible, but still potentially significant, accidental release of a regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS. However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may not have been included to its fullest extent in order to create potential worst-case alternate release scenarios. In helping to establish the Alternate Release Scenarios that are more credible and likely, various information such as previous incident history, PHA failure scenarios, siting and spacing studies, etc. were considered.\n\n\n\nNote: For Security purposes, the Offsite Consequence Analysis description and scenarios are not shown in the Executive Summary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident Prevention Program in place at the Sweeny Refinery.  Because processes at the plant are subject to both EPA Risk Management Program Rule and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance, this summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.  \n\n\n\nA. Employee Participation\n\n\n\nSweeny Refinery management supports and encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the Sweeny Refinery's Accident Prevention Program.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nC. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nA formal PHA process is established to help ensure that potential process-related hazards are identified and controlled. Within this process, PHAs are conducted to systematically examine covered processes to identify potential process-related hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary method used to perform these PHA evaluations. Additional PHA tools and methodologies (e.g., Layers of Protection Analysis, What-If, etc.) are utilized based on need and appropriateness for the process under review. The PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise.\n\n\n\nAny PHA findings or recommendations identified are forwarded to the respective team management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate priority attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked to completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in the facility formal corrective act"

Employee Ownership and VPP (Behavior Based Safety Process, Safety in Motion, ergonomics, traffic safety, general safety, safety concerns),\n\n?    Pollution Prevention (recycling programs, waste prevention and minimization, wildlife tours),  \n\n?    Safety Standards and Procedures (review, edit, create, and audit)\n\n?    Process Safety (process safety metrics, Process Safety Event lessons-learned, communication and re-education of PSM/process safety).\n\n\n\nB. Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used for the safe and reliable operation of facility processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific teams/groups within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining current and up to date process safety information.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation.\n\n\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, to include: unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Formal processes and procedures are developed and maintained through the Training Team to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nE. Training\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program consisting of various job/certification models for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to help verify contractors have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of the potential hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules and procedures, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they may discover during the course of their work. Various information is communicated and provided to contractors to help accomplish this to include:\n\n?    Process overviews,\n\n?    Information regarding safety and health hazards (e.g., SDSs),\n\n?    Emergency Response Plan information,\n\n?    Safe work practices applicable to contractor work activities.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Sweeny Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as part of the contractor selection process. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to help ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.

Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nSweeny Refinery has well established practices and procedures to help ensure covered process equipment is maintained in a safe and reliable condition, to include: pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems. The basic aspects of this program include: training, written procedures, inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  \n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and the applicable safe work practices necessary to perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures confirm work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to verify equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or appropriate personnel/teams will review the use of the equipment and determine what act"

Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Sweeny Refinery has established a formal incident reporting and investigation process to promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, chemical release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause of the incident and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops corrective actions to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management and respective Teams for resolution.  Corrective actions documented in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked to completion in the facility formal incident reporting and corrective action tracking database, and retained in accordance with the company document records retention policy.\n\n\n\nL. Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nTo confirm the HSE systems are functioning properly, Sweeny Refinery periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the Accident Prevention Program are being implemented. Formal compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. These formal audits are conducted and documented as part of the Corporate Audit process.  In addition, periodic internal self-audits are conducted to verify compliance on an on-going basis. A report of any findings from the compliance audits are documented in the facility formal corrective action tracking database and tracked to completion. The two most recent audit reports are retained for review.\n\n\n\nM.
