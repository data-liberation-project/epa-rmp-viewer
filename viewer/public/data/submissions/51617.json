Training shall include escape routes, notification of appropriate response agencies, instructions on activating a building fire alarm system and what should be done after evacuating a building. To aid in the training process evacuation drills are conducted at the facility.  In the case of an emergency, Doug Obermueller is the emergency response coordinator and has overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of the emergency response plan. The alternate emergency response coordinator is Dennis Jacobson, plant manager.  Arrangements have been made to coordinate Universal Cold Storage\u00bfs Emergency Action Plan and applicable emergency services with the following local agencies:\n\nLancaster County LEPC \n(402)-441-7441\n\nLancaster County Sheriff Department\n(402)-786-6500\n\nLincoln Fire Department\n(402)-786-3055\n\nUpon discovering an emergency situation, all employees shall immediately notify their supervisor or the Maintenance Department using the phone, vocally or wireless phones. The supervisor of the affected area should immediately contact the Emergency Response Coordinator to determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, the Emergency Response Coordinator will sound an evacuation alarm, then determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area and will be relayed to the Evacuation Coordinators.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the event of an evacuation, all employees should proceed to the designated assembly area and await further instructions from their evacuation supervisor.

These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\tOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\tUniversal Cold Storage is a cold storage plant located in Lincoln, Nebraska.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  \n\tThe refrigeration is operated as a high and low stage system.  On the low stage portion of the system, a low temperature accumulator operates at -20\u00b0F pumps liquid to supply a liq"

Freezer #1 and Cooler #2 can operate either on the high stage or the low stage.     The low temperature recirculated liquid flows through the coils in the air units where it picks up heat from the room and product.  Air from the fans blows across the coils, changing the liquid to a vapor. The low temperature recirculated suction vapor is sent from the air units coils to the low temperature accumulator via a suction header.\n\nOn the high stage portion of the system, a high pressure liquid flows into the economizers of HSC-2 and HSC-3 to produce subcooled liquid. The subcooled liquid supplies a liquid header which feeds all the evaporators on the system plus all the heat exchangers.  The units in the Cooler #2 and Freezer #1 are designed to maintain a 26-34\u00b0F temperature if operating on high stage.  The units in Cooler #1, Dock #4, and Dock #5 are designed to maintain 26-34\u00b0F.  The units in Dock #3 are designed to maintain a temperature of 35-40\u00b0F.  The subcooled liquid flows through the coils in the air units where it picks up heat from the room and product.  Air from the fans blows across the coils, changing the liquid to a vapor. The high temperature dry suction vapor is sent from the air units coils to the intercooler via a suction header.\nVapor from the intercooler is fed to high stage compressors. During the compression phase in the high stage compressors, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150-180 psig. \nThe high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to the evaporative condensers where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a high pressure liquid.  The high-pressure liquid is collected in a high-pressure receiver.  The liquid collected in the high-pressure receiver provides liquid make-up for the intercooler.\n\nThe emergency ac"

Once everyone has evacuated the facility and arrived at their designated meeting area, a head count must be conducted by the evacuation coordinator to account for missing people, including visitors and/or contractors in his/her area. Ten minutes will be allowed for critical unit operators to shutdown their equipment and reach the designated meeting location before attendance will be reported.  \nIn the event of an emergency release of ammonia it will be necessary for some specifically assigned and properly trained employees to remain in work areas that are being evacuated long enough to perform critical operations. The critical operations shutdown procedures to be followed by those employees who have been assigned for essential building operations include:\n\nPlant Engineer: Shutdown the ammonia refrigeration system by using one of the Emergency Stop (E-stop) switches located just inside of the engine room doors.\nPlant Manager:   Shutdown critical equipment and operate fire extinguishers if necessary and practical.\n\nIn response to an ammonia release, Universal Cold Storage will not respond to releases of hazardous chemicals in an offensive manner. The facility does not have any employees trained at the HAZMAT Technicians or First Responders Operations Level.  However, in the case of a minor ammonia release, designated maintenance personnel are allowed to isolate or maintain the release.\nUniversal Cold Storage has not had any accidental releases to report since the commissioning of the plant.\nThe high pressure receiver in the engine room has the capacity to hold a maximum of 7,150 lbs. The total charge in the system is 16,149 lbs. In the event of a worst case scenario, we will assume the entire charge is released for ten minutes. This would be 16,149 lbs of ammonia.
