These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of ammonia as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals and specifically ammonia, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels, which are inter-connected, and separate vessels, which are located such that ammonia could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to, and accepted by all employees at the facility."
