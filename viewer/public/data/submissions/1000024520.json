The purpose of this Plan is to help prevent or minimize risk of exposure to chlorine gas for both employees of the Facility and also the surrounding community.\n\n\n\n1. FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Eagan Water Treatment facilities treat an average of 9.6 million gallons of water per day. The Coachman Facility uses up to 350 pounds per day of chlorine for disinfection and may have up to 24,000 pounds of chlorine stored at the site. The chlorine is stored in 2,000 pound containers.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is required to create a Risk Management Plan for chlorine in compliance with Environmental Protection Agency Regulation 40 CFR 68. Creation of the RMP also provides compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirement in OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. A Facility follows this regulation when it houses more than a threshold quantity of a regulated material for use in a wastewater treatment process. Both Eagan facilities maintain more than the threshold quantity, 2,500 pounds, of chlorine on-site at any given time. An original RMP was created and submitted to the EPA in June of 1999. This edition represents the required five-year update of that earlier Plan.\n\n\n\n2. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\n\nThe Coachman Point Facility feed system operates on a vacuum principle with automatic shut off valves if the vacuum is interrupted.  Should a chlorine leak happen, automatic shut off valves would cut off the chlorine supply.  Eagan personnel would then determine the source of the leak and if a cylinder needs to be placed in a cylinder containment vessel.  All release scenarios used in this plan do not take into account any containment operation or other mitigation.  They are not included in the scenarios in order to calculate the worst case circumstances.  \n\n\n\nThe Coachman Point Water Treatment Facility also is equip"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Eagan Water Treatment Facilities are included in the community emergency response plan.  Emergency response would only be used in the rare occurrence that there is a major release and the automatic shut off valves or containment vessel is not used.  In the event of a release, an employee of the Coachman Point Plant would be responsible for calling the Eagan Fire Department.  The fire department would then assess if a HAZMAT team should be notified.  These organizations are trained in handling emergency situations and hazardous materials.  These agencies would be responsible for mitigating the effects of the chlorine release and coordinating evacuation procedures if necessary.\n\n\n\nA training program has been established to ensure that all employees of the treatment facility can identify an emergency situation and understand the procedure for notifying the proper employees.  As part of this program, facility employees will also meet with representatives of the fire department to discuss and review the treatment plant and its emergency response.\n\n\n\n4. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RMP/PSM PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Facility has implemented written procedures in compliance with the RMP/PSM regulations to help minimize the risk of a chlorine release. The revised RMP/PSM Manual outlines training requirements, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and defines responsible persons for implementing the aspects of the Plan. The RMP/PSM Plan will continue to provide guidance for the Facility?s day-to-day operation, thereby creating a safer and more effective work environment.\n\n\n\nMike Chell, Water Production Supervisor, shall be the RMProgram Manager with overall responsibility for implementation of the Risk Management Program. This Program Manager shall be responsible for delegating responsibility for specific elements and al"
