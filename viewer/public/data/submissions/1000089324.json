If an accident should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Ashton Fire Department, Lee County Local Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 2290 Quarry Road Ashton Illinois 61006, is the storage and distribution of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consist of (1) 18,,000 and (2) 30,000 gallon storage tanks and (4) rail cars, loading riser, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 1,194,414 pounds; this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in nurse tanks and rail cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of Title 8 Illinois Administrative Code Part 215: Anhydrous Ammonia, Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities, based upon the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA's) \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" (6th edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\", and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"."
