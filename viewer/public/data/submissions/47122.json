The stationary source is the Boar's Head Provisions processing and distribution center located at 2230 Wyatts Mill Road, Jarratt, VA.  The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia -- which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. \n\nThis is a new RMP for an existing refrigeration system to be expanded above the threshold planning quantity of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThis process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It will be subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. \n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW \nThis food processing and distribution facility operates two covered ammonia refrigeration processes. The systems operates  with an engine room capacity down to 0\u00b0F cooling temperature. The refrigeration system is a liquid re-circulation system and is designed to operate at with overfeed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. \n\nThis ammonia refrigeration system contains five interconnected sub-systems:\n\nHigh temperature system (+14\u00b0F @ 27.5 PSIG).\nLow temperature system (0\u00b0F @ 15.7 PSIG).\nHigh pressure receiver system (+95\u00b0F @ 181.1 PSIG).\nCondenser system.\nCompresso"

      "SummaryText": "ict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids. \n\nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems. This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.  These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even replacement in kind) be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.

Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for hte RMP. Following is an overview.\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and LEPC.\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There ar"

This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator. Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments. The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.\n\nTraining - All employees who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\n\nContractors - This site follows str"

The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\nEmergency Response Plan - This facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  This plan will be provided to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nCompliance Audits and RMP Revisions - To insure that all the other 12 areas of PSM program are followed, the company requires compliance audits.  At a minimum, these must be completed every three years.\nResubmission of the RMP shall be done according to Section 6.2 to meet the OCA requirements.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY - LAST FIVE YEARS\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents within the past five years.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nWe continually review the PSM and RMP programs and are proactive in ensuring all measures taken afford the best integrity of our system."
