THE FACILITY POLICY\n\nTHE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF KROWN INC DBA HI-YIELD PRODUCTS ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF PROPANE. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY OR OTHER AUTHORITIES TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO  PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n    THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND PROPANE SALES AND DELIVERY.                                                                                                                                                   PROPANE GAS IS RECEIVED, STORED,AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DELIVERY FOR HOME HEATING, FARM AND COMMERICAL BUSINESS USES.\n\n   THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF PROPANE GAS STORED WOULD BE 108,000 POUNDS IN OUR 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n      a: THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85 PERCENT CAPACITY (108,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE. ACCORDING TO EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .43 MILES.\n\n    B: THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85 PERCENT (108,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN TWO-THIRDS OF A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE.  ACCORDING TO EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS (FACTOR OF .67 X .43 = .29 MILES) .29 MILES.\n\n4.
