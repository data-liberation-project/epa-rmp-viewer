This tank truck is unloaded in to a 30,000 gal. above ground storage tank using a transfer pump. The facility has administrative controls in place, which limit the volume of stored material to 85% of the tank size.  Therefore 25,500 gal.

      "SummaryText": "A. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances handled\n\n\n\nGenpak LLC - Longview, Texas (Genpak) produces polystyrene foam food trays and containers. The process takes polystyrene pellets through an extrusion process where a nuclient and blowing agent mixture (isopentane and n-butane; 70%/30%) is added to make mill rolls for storage. These rolls are then thermoformed and cut to produce the final product.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the manufacturing process, the blowing agent is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified by EPA regulations. Genpak has one covered process that requires compliance with Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\n\n\n\nThe isopentane/n-butane mixture is delivered to the facility via tank truck. The tank truck is unloaded into an above ground storage tank using a transfer pump.  A vapor recovery system prevents the release of vapors to the atmosphere during the transfer. The mixture is pumped from the storage tank to the pump room where the pressure is increased so it can be injected into one of the three extruders.\n\n\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Genpak\n\n\n\nGenpak is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Hazard Communication Plan, and Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nSafety, environmental protection and risk management programs are implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA, RMP regulations Genpak performed the following offsite consequence analyses.\n\n\n\n- One worst-case release scenario for the isopentane/n-butane mixture.\n\n- One alternate-case release scenario for isopentane/n-butane mixture. \n\n\n\nGenpak used the EPA RMP*COMP to calculate "

Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accident release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  There were no accidental releases that occurred during the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nE. Prevention Program Elements\n\n\n\nManagement System - Genpak has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the RMP Program to a qualified individual or position of responsibility. It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Up-to-date process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.65, including the following:\n\n\n\n- MSDSs for isopentane that contain toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process flows.\n\n- Block flow diagrams for the covered process.\n\n-Process chemistry and maximum intended inventory data for the covered process.\n\n- Safe operating limits and evaluation of consequences of deviations from these limits for the covered process.\n\n- Covered process equipment information consisting of materials of construction; piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs); electric classification; relief system design and design basis; ventilation system design; design codes and standards employed; and safety systems (interlocks, detection or suppression systems).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - A PHA has been performed for the Program 3 covered process at Genpak in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.67.

Any issues identified during the PHA were documented and resolved in a timely manner. The PHA will be revalidated and updated once every five years following completion of the initial PHA.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures - Detailed and up-to-date process operating procedures have been developed and are maintained for the isopentane process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.69. Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process. Operating procedures are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain current and accurate.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures cover each operating phase of the covered process including initial system startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and conditions that require, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown. Operating procedures also incorporate or reference relevant process safety information including the following:\n\n\n\n- Process operating limits (including consequences of deviations and steps to correct or avoid such deviations)\n\n- Safety and health considerations (including properties and hazards of covered chemicals, precautions necessary to prevent exposure, control measures to be taken upon physical contact or airborne exposure, quality control for raw materials, and control of regulated substance inventories).\n\n- Safety systems and their functions.\n\n\n\nTraining - New employees working with a covered process receive initial training in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.71.

Employees involved in the maintenance of the covered process receive additional training, which includes an overview of the process, its hazards, and applicable procedures to ensure that the employee can perform the job in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to ensure that the covered process equipment is properly maintained, tested, and inspected at regular, scheduled intervals and that such activities are thoroughly documented. Maintenance, inspection and testing procedures and frequencies are consistent with applicable manufacturer's recommendations and follow accepted engineering practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance, inspection or testing are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - A written MOC procedure has been implemented to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.75.

Each contractor employee is informed of the known potential fire, explosion hazard related to work on a covered process as well as the relevant provisions of the emergency response program. Procedures are in place to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employees in covered process areas. Periodically, the performance of the contract owner or operator is evaluated while working in or adjacent to a covered process.\n\n\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nGenpak will only respond to incidental releases of isopentane where the release can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel. For non-incidental releases Genpak will rely on outside responders. Therefore, Genpak has coordinated response actions with the local fire department and ensured that appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response.\n\n\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBased on operational knowledge from other facilities, Genpak believes that the existing safety program is adequate. However, if any changes occur in the future which affect the isopentane process, these changes will be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the safety of Genpak employees and neighbors is not compromised."
