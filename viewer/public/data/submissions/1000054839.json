Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nWoodford Express, LLC (Woodford Express) owns a natural gas processing plant (Grady Plant) located in Lindsay, Oklahoma.  It is Woodford Express' policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Grady Plant has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. \n\nNo regulated toxic chemicals (listed in 40 CFR ?68.130) is handled at the Grady Plant.  The plant handles flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 4.  Safety precautions are in place when handling flammable mixtures to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health and safety of personnel, contractors, the community and the environment.  \n\nGrady Plant is designated as a non-responding facility, which means that the local fire departments and other local emergency responders have primary responsibility for responding to accidental releases. The Grady Plant Emergency Action Plan (EAP) defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The EAP includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken to ensure local emergency responders are informed of the event.  The EAP also includes procedures for notifying facility personnel, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and Chikasha Fire Departments.  \n\n\n\nB.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe Grady Plant process natural gas received via pipeline.  The Grady Plant Train I and Train 2 process natural gas received via pipeline with a cryogenic processing capacity of 210 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD).  The gas is dehydrated and processed to remove heavy (liquid) hydrocarbons from the gas stream. The cryogenic unit is designed to liquefy natural gas l"

The cryogenic unit recovers NGL by cooling the gas stream and condensing components such as butane, ethane, pentane, propane and heavier.  The NGL and condensates are flammable mixtures that meet NFPA-4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nC.    The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios\n\nThe scenarios were modeled assuming none of the protective barriers worked for the plant.\n\n\n\na.    Worst case scenario:\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumes that the vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (V-401 Slug Catcher) had a catastrophic failure. The flammable material is composed of a mixture that contains the following regulated substances: ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. It is assumed that the mixture is composed entirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage (i.e. the predominant regulated flammable component of the mixture) in this case this substance is pentane.\n\nThe entire weight of the mixture is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. The scenario involved an uncontrolled release of 763,407 lb.  RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.7 miles to the 1 psi endpoint, wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, stability class F with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F).   \n\n\n\nb.    Alternative case scenarios:\n\nTwo alternative scenarios were evaluated.  One scenario was a 3 inch leak from the second largest amount of flammable mixture (Condensate Surge Tank V-403) resulting in vapor cloud fire. The second scenario was done to identify a case closest to a public receptor.  This case evaluated a 4 inch leak from the Stabilized Condensate tanks (TK-452) resulting in a vapor cloud fire. \n\nThe alternative scenarios were calculated using the chemical with the lowest lower flammability limit (LFL).  The LFL for butane, ethane and propane is 36 mg/L, and pentane has a LFL of 38 "

General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe Grady Plant is a PSM-covered facility and, as such, it has a viable process safety program. Workers and their representatives are consulted and have access to information regarding all PSM elements. Complete and accurate information on the process technology, process equipment, hazardous characteristics and physical properties of all chemicals and intermediates for all covered processes is maintained. \n\nProcess Hazards Analyses were conducted on the process to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Major hazards identified include fire, over-pressurization, overfilling, and equipment failure.  Process controls in place include relief valves, check valves, emergency and automatic shutdowns, grounding, interlocks, procedures and training. \n\nTrainings (initial and refresher) are conducted and includes on-the-job and classroom type training.  Written testing is used as means to verify understanding.  \n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide clear written instructions for conducting activities safely. SOPs address operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. SOPs are revised as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nA mechanical integrity program is in place that will perform inspection and tests on equipment and correct any equipment deficiencies and apply quality assurance measures.

Inspection and testing frequencies are prescribed by manufacturers and industry standards.  \n\nA non-routine work authorization program ensures that appropriate measures are taken any time non-routine operations are performed on or near process areas that might initiate or promote a release.\n\nFacility and process changes are managed through a management-of-change (MOC) program.  The MOC program outlines approval responsibilities and requires hazard evaluations prior to the implementation of any changes affecting a covered process.  Affected personnel and contractors are trained in the changes before the change is implemented.  \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) conducted by appropriate employees, as spelled out in the facility's PSSR procedure. \n\nThe facility has an active accident/incident prevention program.  Each incident and near miss associated with the process area is evaluated and, if it meets pre-defined criteria, a team-based investigation is performed.  The investigation's purpose is to identify root and contributing causes and to make recommendations to prevent future recurrence.  Recommendations from the Incident Investigation are tracked to closure.\n\nEmployees are active in all aspects of process safety, including safe work permitting, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, mechanical integrity and management of change.  \n\nAdditionally, contractors are involved in many aspects of the programs.  Woodford Express will screen contractors based on safety performance before they are allowed entrance to the facility.  Employees responsible for projects involving contractors are encouraged to provide feedback to both management and the contractor on the contractor's overall safety performance.\n\n\n\nE.
