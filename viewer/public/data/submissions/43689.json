The operation of the screenings compactor and dewatering unit will operate together with the fine screen operation.  The screened wastewater will pass through grit removal units where the grit and heavier inorganic solids will be removed through the centrifugal action of the unit.  The grit will settle out at the bottom of the grit hopper where a pair of recessed impeller grit pumps will pump the grit to a grit classifier/dewatering unit.  The grit classifier/dewatering unit will separate the grit from the grit slurry and dispose the grit into the collection dumpster.  The grit slurry will be returned to the upstream of the fine screens.\n\nThe screened and degritted wastewater will flow into single stage nitrification aeration basin (formerly the contact stabilization basin (CSB)).  These basins are equipped with fine bubble diffusers that will provide the required amount of aeration necessary for the biological treatment process.  The aeration basins will utilize the existing aeration, reaeration and digester portions of the former CSB.  The walls between these sections will be demolished to create a common aeration basin.  \n\nEach train of the aeration basin effluent will be distributed between two parallel secondary clarifiers.  A total of 4 clarifiers will be used to provide the required clarification area for the total flow.  All 4 of the existing clarifier mechanism will be replaced with a new fixed bridge sludge scraper mechanisms.  The chemical clarifiers will be modified into secondary clarifiers.  All three mixers located in each chemical basin will be removed.

      "SummaryText": "The Stewart Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant facility treats wastewater for the City of The Colony in Denton County, Texas. The plant treats up to 4.5 million gallons of wastewater per day for residents and businesses in The Colony. As of 2005, the facility is undergoing modifications to improve treated water quality, allow for expansion, and to provide for a safer environment through the reduction in use of toxic chemicals in the treatment process.\n\nProcess Overview\nThe Colony WWTP is currently operating as a contact stabilization activated sludge treatment process.  The proposed modifications will change the contact stabilization process into a single stage nitrification process.  These modifications are necessary to bring the plant back into compliance with ammonia discharge limitations and to increase the treatment capacity of the WWTP from an average daily flow (ADF) of 2.3 to a 4.5 MGD.  A brief description of the treatment process is included in the following (in order of treatment process from influent to effluent).  \n\nThe influent wastewater enters the WWTP through a 36\u00bf DIP from the gravity collection system.  The existing dry well configuration will be modified into a full wetwell and will utilize three submersible pumps.  These pumps will be fixed on the north wall of the modified wetwell and will extent to the true finish floor in the lift station structure.  The false floor that makes up the existing influent channel will be removed to add additional volume to the wetwell.  The pumps will operate on level indicating transmitters and motors will be 2-speed.\n\nFrom the lift station, the wastewater will be pumped to a new headworks/preliminary treatment area to include 2 fine screens, 2 screenings compactors, 1 manual bar screen, 2 grit removal chambers, 1 grit classifier/dewatering unit and all related grit pumps, gates, weirs and valves as required.  The fine screens will have the capability to operate under a differential head monitor or a timer (counte"

Effluent from the UV disinfection channel will be routed to the existing reuse pump station wetwell.  This basin is used as storage wet well for the effluent reuse and plant water pumps.  An effluent metering station/Parshall flume is also proposed to provide accurate effluent measurement prior to entering the receiving stream. \n\nThe settled sludge from the clarification process will be removed from the bottom of the sludge hopper using 6 self priming centrifugal pumps.  The RAS/WAS pump station will determine the amount of RAS and WAS flow based on a combination of flow measurement and valve configurations.  The RAS flow will be returned to the headworks effluent splitter box structure while the WAS flow will be sent to the sludge holding tank.    The sludge holding tank will be equipped with several aerator/mixers necessary to prevent anaerobic conditions in the tank.  The Sludge Holding Tank is proposed to provide storage capacity for the WAS flows prior to the dewatering processes.  Dewatering will be conducted using a 2-meter belt filter press.  Dewatered sludge will be disposed of in a municipal landfill.\n\nIn the treatment process, the facility stores and uses chlorine in quantities exceeding the 2,500-pound regulatory threshold established in 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. Sulfur dioxide is also used in the wastewater treatment process but in quantities less than the regulatory threshold. The facility developed a Risk Management Program in 1999 to identify and minimize the potential for a release of chlorine from the facility. The facility's current plant improvements will allow for minimal storage and use of chlorine at the facility. This will provide provide even greater protection for facility employees and the surrounding community and as a result, will remove the facility from the Risk Management Program regulatory requirements.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Prog"

      "SummaryText": "ram\nThe City takes pride in the safe operation of its wastewater treatment plant.  Facility operators are trained in the operation and maintenance of equipment through a variety of methods, including onsite classroom training, off-site classroom training, and on-the-job supervised training. Physical safety features for the chlorination system include leak detectors, alarms, a wind sock, safety eye wash, and an emergency leak repair kit. Procedures for the operation of the chlorination system have been developed and operators receive training in those procedures. A  schedule for preventive maintenance activities has been developed for chlorination system components. The schedule was developed based on manufacturers' recommendations.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nNo releases of chlorine have occurred from the facility in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nMinor chlorine leaks, such as trace detections of chlorine gas from a cylinder changeout operation, are handled by facility operators. If at any time, the leak is considered to be escalating in nature to the point of a significant release, the emergency action plan is implemented. The emergency action plan calls for onsite personnel to evacuate the facility to a secure location and to notify the City Fire Department to conduct emergency response activities. Any significant chlorine leak that potentially threatens the health of on-site personnel or the community or environment off-site results in the activation of the emergency action plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs noted in the facility description, the plant is undergoing modifications currently that will allow for the reduction in storage and use of chlorine in the treatment process.  The facility will shift from using multiple one-ton cylinders of chlorine to using a few 150-pound chlorine cylinders. This will significantly reduce the potential off-site impact in the event a chlorine release were to occur. The facility recently upgraded the"
