The ammonia refrigeration system uses 17,437 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the machine room roof and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe DOT Foods, Inc. facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room or on the machine room roof (condensers). \r\n\r\nAmmonia sensors are present in the machine room and cold storage areas.  The system shuts down if a concentration of 20,000 ppm is detected in the machine room and 35ppm in the cold storage areas.  The operators have the ability to dial into the central computer and read the alarm from a portable computer.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the DOT Foods, Inc. - Williamsport facility's accident history revealed that there have been no reportable ammonia releases (> 100 pounds) over the past five years.

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n\u00bf     To save lives.\r\n\u00bf     To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n\u00bf     To protect the environment.\r\n\u00bf     To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility caused by an ammonia release.  The facility maintains a safety committee (a trained Emergency Response team) whose members are designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The emergency response team is trained to call 9-1-1 in an event of an ammonia release. The 9-1-1 operator will contact the local HAZMAT team and the local Fire and Rescue Squad.
