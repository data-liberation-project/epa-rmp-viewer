The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  \n\nThe facility management has developed an Employee Emergency Action and Fire Prevention Plan.  Along with the emergency procedures and training, a plan is coordinated with local emergency responders to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, a fire or other emergency situation. \n\n\n\nAmericold at Hatfield provides emergency response training for employees through the use of specialists in the industry that are authorized to train.  We believe it is important that employees that participate in emergency response situations are adequately trained in handling emergency situations with anhydrous ammonia systems.  This specialized HAZMAT training follows the guidelines of federal, state and local regulatory agencies.\n\n                                                                                                                                                   \n\nIn order to prevent a potential accidental ammonia release at Americold Hatfield, the Company has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures.  This assists in ensuring the refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and all other local, state regulatory agency safety standards, as well as its own internal standards.\n\n                                                                                                          Americold at Hatfield is a refrigerated warehousing and distribution facility.

The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility operations.  The refrigeration systems in this facility contain approximately 38,145 pounds of ammonia inventory for this process.  Two refrigeration systems operate in individual cold storage warehouses on the property.  Plant 2 has an ammonia charge of approximately 14,800 pounds and Plant 3 has an ammonia charge of approximately 23,336.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericold Logistics, LLC at Hatfield is committed to safe management and operation of the closed Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Maintenance employees are trained to verify operational procedures designed to be as fail-safe as possible to prevent accidental release of ammonia at any time.  Should any accidental release occur, all refrigeration employees are certified Emergency Hazardous Material Responders and are required to observe safe emergency response procedures.  They are trained to work in conjunction with the local Emergency Planning Commission to minimize the impact of any accidental releases.\n\n\n\nAs part of the safety programs, we have adopted the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan as required and is an integral part of our base safety manual.  The OSHA PSM Program has been implemented and covers the entire scope of safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system from start-up and normal operations to potential emergency response operations and turn around after emergencies.
