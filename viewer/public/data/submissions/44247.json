The owner is on site daily to oversee and insure the safe operating procedures.  The policy at Ritzville Chemicals, Inc. includes monthly safety meetings and continuing education.\nRitzville Chemicals, Inc. is an independently owned and operated ag chemical and fertilizer retailer, supplying the needs of the local farm population.  A small tank farm is maintained at the site.  The tank farm includes two 12,000-gallon aqua ammonia tanks and one 12,000-gallon liquid urea-ammonium nitrate tank, one 12,000-gallon liquid ammonium thiosulfate tank, one 6,000-gallon ammonium phosphate solution, one 6,000-gallon water tank and one 6,000-gallon rinsate tank.  Approximately 90% of the fertilizer products are shipped directly to the field.  The tank farm at the site is used for less than truckload quantities.\nThe worst case scenario would be the accidental release of aqua ammonia.  The released product would be contained in the secondary containment structure.  Said structure is constructed of concrete with an impermeable liner.  The containment area would reduce the surface area of the aqua ammonia, in turn, reducing vaporization from release.  The company has pumps and tanks to recover the release.  In the worst case scenario the aqua ammonia could be recovered and stored in portable tanks in approximately one hour, reducing exposure.  Emergency Response Plan includes proper sequence and the agencies to be notified.  Weather conditions and wind direction would determine if notification would be necessary for down wind facilities.\nRitzville Chemicals, Inc. operates under the WSDA rules relating to secondary and operational area containment for bulk fertilizer storage facilities.  The company's last inspection by the WSDA was May 25, 2000.  The plumbing consists of stainless steel valves, chemical resistant, UV resistant, non-corrosive, impact resistant pipin"
