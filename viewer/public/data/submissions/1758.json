The Facility Policy\n\n        The owners, management, and employees of Agmax,Inc. Reagan Agronomy are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department. LEPC, or other agencies, to control any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people, property, and the environment.\n\n2.   Facility Information\n\n          The primary activity at Agmax.Inc. Reagan Agronomy is the storage and blending of fertilizers for custom application and sale to farmers.\n\n          Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n          The maximum quantity stored would be 12,000 gallon storage tank and 13 wagon type nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi transport trailer of approximately 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.   The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n           a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our 12,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 53,000 pounds, which is the volume of our storage tank when filled to 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.50 miles.\n\n4.    The accident release prevention program.\n\n            Agmax Inc. Reagan Agronomy has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111.  Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.     The Five-year Accident History."

      "SummaryText": "Reagan Agronomy had an accidental release at this site on October 5, 1998 at approximately 1:30 P.M.  Release was due to a rupture in the 2 inch liquid transport hose while unloading from the transport to the storage tank.  Reported loss was approximately 556 pounds. There were no deaths nor injuries as a result of the rupture. There was no property damage nor environmental damage as a result.  Transport was shut down immediately there was no evacuation.  As a result of this incident both the liquid and the vapor hoses were replaced.  \n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program.\n\n       The facility has:\n             a. A written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.36\n\n             b. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n                 information as required under SARA TITLE lll (EPCRA)\n\n             c. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR\n                 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n       Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to \n       assess the maintaining of safe conditions, as well as continued training.  There are no additional \n       specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
