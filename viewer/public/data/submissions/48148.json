City of Brawley is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring Community.  City of Brawley staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facility to provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using chlorine for water treatment.  Chlorine plays an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe facility has a long-standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorine system. The facility?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe chlorine system at the City of Brawley?s Water Treatment Plant is used for the treatment of water prior to pumping into the City's water supply pipelines.\n\nThe Chlorine Room stores a total of eight containers. The chlorine containers are placed on weight scales lined up side-by-side connected to the chlorine system. Normally all eight of the chlorine containers are kept online. The containers are connected by a yoke and adapter with new lead gaskets.\n\nChlorine gas under pressure flows from the online container through a vacuum regulator. The vacuum regulators reduce the chlorine pressure to a vacuum. The chlorine gas is su"

The chlorinators meter and inject gaseous chlorine into the raw water supply as it enters the Water Treatment Facility?s chlorine contact basins. Chlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines. \nChlorine leak detection and warning are provided by an alarm system. Four chlorine detectors with alarms are located in the Chlorination Room. The alarms sound locally with indication lights at the City of Brawley Water Treatment Facility. The alarms also actuate a two scrubber system located within the Chlorination Room. In addition to actuating the scrubbers if the detector alarms it will also send a page to Treatment Operators Grade 3 and calls the control room located onsite at the City of Brawley Water Treatment Plant.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab of the Compliance Workbook. The chlorine cylinders are located in a building; therefore, this passive mitigation measure was incorporated in the calculations.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by regulation.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nA more realistic alternative release scenario was also modeled. The meteorological conditions specified by CalARP requirements for alternative release scenarios were used. RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario. The results can be fou"

A Scrubber System to neutralize the chlorine in the event of a release.\n?    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus) is used by plant personnel.\n?    The history of the City of Brawley Water Treatment Plant (i.e., no RMP-applicable chlorine releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Chlorine System.\n?    Detection and alarm systems with automatic notification.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key prevention program elements were implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine systems. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there are chlorine leak detectors situated in all rooms that contain chlorine.  In the event of a release the alarms sound locally with indication lights at the City of Brawley Water Treatment Facility. The alarms also actuate a two scrubber system located within the Chlorination Room. In addition to actuating the scrubbers if the detector a"

The prevention program elements satisfy the requirements of CalARP, EPA RMP, and OSHA PSM.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no EPA RMP nor CalARP-applicable releases of chlorine at the facility in at least the past five (5) years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility?s employees are not first responders and are not required to have an Emergency Response Plan.  However, the facility implements an Emergency Action Plan that is kept onsite.  This plan includes:\n?    Reporting Procedures\n?    Evacuation Procedures\n?    Emergency Alarm Procedures\n?    Safety and Health Considerations\n?    Employee Alarm System\n?    Training\n?

These studies include the following: Process Hazard Analysis, Seismic Assessment, and Hazard Assessment. The planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in these reports.  Any outstanding recommendations from these studies will be addressed by July 2007.  \n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS\nThis is a new submission, therefore a Compliance Audit has not been completed yet.
