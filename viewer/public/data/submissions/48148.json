City of Brawley is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring Community.  City of Brawley staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facility to provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using chlorine for water treatment.  Chlorine plays an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe facility has a long-standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorine system. The facility\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe chlorine system at the City of Brawley\u00bfs Water Treatment Plant is used for the treatment of water prior to pumping into the City's water supply pipelines.\n\nThe Chlorine Room stores a total of eight containers. The chlorine containers are placed on weight scales lined up side-by-side connected to the chlorine system. Normally all eight of the chlorine containers are kept online. The containers are connected by a yoke and adapter with new lead gaskets.\n\nChlorine gas under pressure flows from the online container through a vacuum regulator. The vacuum regulators reduce the chlorine pressure to a vacuum. The chlorine gas is su"

The chlorinators meter and inject gaseous chlorine into the raw water supply as it enters the Water Treatment Facility\u00bfs chlorine contact basins. Chlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines. \nChlorine leak detection and warning are provided by an alarm system. Four chlorine detectors with alarms are located in the Chlorination Room. The alarms sound locally with indication lights at the City of Brawley Water Treatment Facility. The alarms also actuate a two scrubber system located within the Chlorination Room. In addition to actuating the scrubbers if the detector alarms it will also send a page to Treatment Operators Grade 3 and calls the control room located onsite at the City of Brawley Water Treatment Plant.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab of the Compliance Workbook. The chlorine cylinders are located in a building; therefore, this passive mitigation measure was incorporated in the calculations.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by regulation.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nA more realistic alternative release scenario was also modeled. The meteorological conditions specified by CalARP requirements for alternative release scenarios were used. RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario. The results can be fou"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there are chlorine leak detectors situated in all rooms that contain chlorine.  In the event of a release the alarms sound locally with indication lights at the City of Brawley Water Treatment Facility.

Any outstanding recommendations from these studies will be addressed by July 2007.  \n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS\nThis is a new submission, therefore a Compliance Audit has not been completed yet.
