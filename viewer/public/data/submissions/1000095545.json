      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nNiteo Products, LLC has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and strives to continuously improve safety and environmental operations of its facilities. This commitment is demonstrated by significant investments of resources to prevent releases of hazardous substances and for accident prevention, such as employee participation and training, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  Niteo's published policy is to implement practical controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. However, in the very unlikely event that a release occurs, Niteo has a well-defined emergency action plan and controls to contain the release and minimize any impacts.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Niteo Plant, located in Hernando, Mississippi, produces a variety of car-care and other products. The facility consists of an outdoor tank farm and administrative and manufacturing buildings where the finished products are processed and packaged. These products are well known under various brand names including Valvoline and Pyroil. The plant has an excellent safety and environmental record, with a high level of employee involvement and commitment to operational excellence.\r\n\r\nThe Niteo Plant has two manufacturing processes (starting fluid manufacturing and the Ozium Line) that use flammable substances listed in the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  The starting fluid process uses ethyl ether and the Ozium Line uses a mixture of isobutane and difluoroethane.  There are no toxic regulated substances above the threshold quantity at the site.  In both processes the listed material is received at the facility by truck shipments and stored in storage tanks prior to use in blending the final products.  Both process operations are covered by OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard and are considered Program Level 3 for the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nA Produc"

      "SummaryText": "t Distribution Center (warehouse), located on adjoining property (separated by railroad tracks), stores finished products which may contain ethyl ether, butane, isobutane, propane, or difluoroethane. The warehouse is also included in this RMP as a separate process because the total quantity in small product containers (ranging from 3.5 to 11 oz. cans) may exceed the threshold quantity sometime during peak storage season. The warehouse is considered eligible for Program Level 1 for the RMP rule because: \r\n\r\n1. There are no public receptors within a distance to an endpoint from a worst-case scenario;\r\n2. The warehouse has had no releases of a regulated substance in the past five years resulting in offsite exposure or consequences; and\r\n3. The warehouse emergency response activities are coordinated with the local responders.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place for the starting fluid manufacturing and Ozium production processes at the Hernando, MS plant.  As noted, the processes are subject to the OSHA PSM standard and has programs and procedures in place to address each of the elements required under that standard.  Key features of the prevention program include the following:\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - Employees are active in all aspects of the prevention program, including participating in process hazards analyses, operating procedure development, management of change and others.  The specific means and methods for employee involvement are outlined in a written procedure maintained by the plant.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information and Process Hazards Analyses - The plant maintains files of the information about the chemicals, technology, and equipment in the process necessary to safe operation.  Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs) using the information have been conducted to identify and characterize potential hazards in the process. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who"

The PHAs insure that appropriate safeguards are in place to minimize the risk of any releases associated with the process.  Any recommendations that come from the PHAs are addressed and documented.  The PHAs are reviewed and updated whenever major changes are planned or at least every five years.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures and Training - The Niteo plant maintains written procedures for the operation of the process that address all modes of operation, including start-up/shutdown, normal operation and emergency operations.  The procedures define the safe operating parameters for the operation and highlight the steps necessary for safe operation.  These procedures are reviewed and updated at least annually.  The procedures are available to all employees, are used in training new operators and in refresher training for experienced operators.  The plant also maintains a comprehensive training program for all employees.  The training covers the operation of the process as well as safety training and emergency response training.  Written tests along with observation and demonstration are used to insure that employees are properly prepared for operation of the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\r\n\r\nContractor Management - The Niteo plant has a comprehensive program in place to manage any contractors that may be needed during periods of increased maintenance or construction activity.  The program requires that contractor safety performance be reviewed as part of the selection process and that all contractor employees who come onto the site receive the necessary orientation and training to insure that they can work safely.  Periodic audits of contractor safety performance are conducted to review any issues that might arise.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change - A comprehensive management of change (MOC) procedure is also in place at Niteo.
