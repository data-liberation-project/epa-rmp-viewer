      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Arkema Inc. (Arkema) - Crosby, Texas manufacturing facility (Crosby facility) has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) to reduce the risk of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The plan summary\r\nis organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including the following:\r\n\r\n-Arkema Inc Loss Control Program to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety;\r\n-Facility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes;\r\n-General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps;\r\n-\r\n-Five-Year Accident History;\r\n-Emergency Response Plan; and\r\n-Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nARKEMA INC. LOSS CONTROL PROGRAM FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\r\n\r\nArkema is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety by conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers areas such as equipment design and installation, plant operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Crosby plant. The RMP formalizes the management system that documents these activities.\r\n\r\nThis commitment to Loss Control starts with AIMS, integrated management systems pertaining to health, environment, and safety (HES). This program starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the HES Team regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Arkema lnc.'s HES programs is also attributable to a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\r\n\r\nArkema's HES programs include policies, pro"

These materials include RMP guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES\r\n\r\nThe Arkema Crosby facility is located at 18000 Crosby-Eastgate Road about two miles east of Crosby, Texas.  The facility manufactures liquid organic peroxides, which are primarily used in the production of plastic resins, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, and fiberglass.  Two substances present at the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA RMP rule.  Specifically, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and 2-methyl propene (isobutylene) are present at, or above, the minimum threshold quantity (TQ) for RMP applicability.  \r\n\r\nThe Crosby facility has one primary operating production unit designated as the multi-purpose Unit or MPU.  SO2 and isobutylene are used as raw materials and processing aids in the manufacture of several organic peroxide products.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Arkema Crosby facility has an accidental release prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases.  This program is designed to address the requirements of both the EPA RMP rule in 40 CFR 68 and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule in 29 CFR 1910.119.  The accidental release prevention program includes the following elements and activities:\r\n\r\n-Process safety information is compiled and evaluated to inform the process hazard analyses undertaken by facility personnel;\r\n\r\n-Quantitative process hazard analyses (PHAs using LOPA methodology) are completed on covered processes every five (5) years. Qualified PHA leaders are trained in PHA techniques approved\r\nunder the EPA RMP and OSHA PSM standards;\r\n\r\n-Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the wo"

This includes Level Ill training for all operators;\r\n\r\n-As part of the facility's Mechanical Integrity program, pressure vessels and transfer lines are inspected and tested according to the American Petroleum Institute (API) certified inspectors using API standards;\r\n\r\n-Environmental and Safety Critical equipment is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to ensure proper operating conditions;\r\n\r\n-A Management of Change (MOC) system is in place to ensure that process-operating changes are managed safely;\r\n\r\n-Pre-start-up safety reviews are performed to satisfy conditions for safe operation prior to starting new or modified equipment or processes;\r\n\r\n-Routine compliance audits are conducted to evaluate that safe practices are being followed;\r\n\r\n-Incidents are investigated and actions taken as part of a continuous improvement effort;\r\n\r\n-Plant and other Arkema employees are involved in all phases of the conduct and development of PHAs and other features of the release prevention programs;  \r\n\r\n-A safe work permitting system is used to ensure routine and non-routine work is carried out after proper task identification, hazard assessment and implementation of safe work practices has taken place;\r\n\r\n-Storage tanks and associated equipment are designed and constructed in accordance with industry codes, standards (American Society of Mechanical Engineers - ASME), and practices;\r\n\r\n-All plant process components are inspected and monitored on a regularly scheduled basis as part of the leak detection and repair program (LDAR);\r\n\r\n-The risk of over pressure of pressurized storage tanks is addressed by monitoring the tank temperature and pressure cont"

Access to all plant unloading lines is controlled via a key and lock system in the QC Laboratory to prevent inadvertent material transfers. Logistic personnel remain present during the entirety of the loading and unloading process.\r\n\r\n \r\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves all facility employees. Management and facility personnel strive for continuous improvements in accident reduction. The training, qualification standards, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are key elements in reducing and mitigating accidents.\r\n\r\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures in use at the Crosby facility make it very unlikely that worst-case or alternative release scenarios will occur. In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, Arkema Inc. has mitigation measures in place to reduce any potential impacts, including the following:\r\n\r\n-Remote shut-off valves on tank piping designed to shut down flow from the feedstock storage tanks, thereby reducing the amount potentially released;\r\n\r\n-Area monitors that either prompt the control room to activate shutoff of vessel isolation valves or initiate automatic closing of the isolation valves;\r\n\r\n-Excess flow valves on tank pro"

The plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident; documentation of proper first aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection and testing; descriptions of the training programs for all employees and contractors in the relevant emergency response procedures; and the review and update of our response plan to reflect changes at the facility and to ensure that employees and contractors are informed of these changes.  The appendix of the plan contains a listing of critical environmental, and critical safety equipment.  The facility also conducts emergency drills on a regular basis and the plan is updated as appropriate based on the review of incidents and/or drills.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nChemical exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts, employee involvement and participation, and hazard evalua"
