Expect continuous improvement.\n\nThe Penreco facility, located in Karns City, Pennsylvania handles one chemical above the threshold quantity listed in the Risk Management Plan regulation.  Specifically, oleum is stored in an aboveground storage tank above the threshold quantity.\n\nThe worst case scenario was determined to be a failure of the oleum aboveground storage tank.  Since the facility is only an RMP Program Level 1, an alternate release scenario was not reguired or developed.  Mitigation measures to control the release include a concrete dike six feet in height that would be capable of containing > 100% of the volume of the storage tank.  Further, the tank is located approximately in the geographic center of the Penreco facility (not at the property border).  Penreco is prepared to handle a worst case release by training its emergency responders in Hazwoper Level 3, 40 CFR, Section 1910.120.  \n\nPrevention steps include a strict inspection schedule, the implementation of numerous procedures, and carefully observing Process Safety Management guidelines.\n\nThere have been no accidents at Penreco in the past five years involving the regulated substance that have had an off-site effect.\n\nA comprehensive emergency response program/plan has been developed and is regularly used to train both in-house and local responders.\n\nTo improve safety, Penreco is developing a local inter-company response group to deal with emergency situations at the member facilities.  Through membership, the groups would have access to additional equipment and personnel to handle the emergency situations.  Penreco is coordinating efforts at the local college level to further develop regulatory training for contract employees.  This training will be mandatory prior to employment at the facility.  Finally, Penreco is an active member of the Butler County LEPC."

      "SummaryText": "A review of the Risk Management Plan regulation has indicated that 20 % oleum is the only chemical used in a process at the site, at any one time, in quantities above the RMP threshold applicability level.  Therefore, a worst case scenario review was performed for oleum.  This chemical is used in the white oil oleum process.  The results indicated that a potential release of oleum could not affect offsite receptors under release conditions madated by the EPA.  The area potentially impacted does not contain any sensitive receptors.  Therefore, the facility qualifies for Program Level 1 compliance in accordance with the RMP regulation.  No offsite population or sensitive receptors are within the zone of influence as defined by the EPA.\n\nPenreco is committed to maintaining comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs which meet and or exceed all federal and state requirements.  Injury and Incident Free is Penreco's safety and environmental principle.  The company's environmental, safety and health policy is as follows:\n\nProtecting the environment and the safety and health of employees, customers, contractors, communities and the public is fundamental to the way Penreco conducts its business.  To integrate environmental, safety and health management into business activities worldwide, Penreco will:\n\n 1.   Pursue excellence in the design, construction, operation and restoration of all properties and facilities;\n 2.   Be a responsible steward of all products and services;\n 3.   Train and prepare employees for emergencies and other contingencies;\n 4.   Communicate openly regarding business activities;\n 5.   Assign clear responsibilities to all employees and contractors;\n 6.   Provide employees with resources and training to meet assigned responsibilities;\n 7.   Assess the potential risks of business activities;\n 8.   Comply with all applicable laws and regulations;\n 9.   Participate in the development of new laws, regulations and technologies;\n10.  R"
