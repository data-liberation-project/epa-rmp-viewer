      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Frozen Foods, which is owned by C.H. Guenther & Son, Inc., operates a food manufacturing facility in Duncanville, Texas, that prepares and freezes baked goods for commercial use.  This site was initially owned by Texas Custom Bakers and was acquired by C.H. Guenther & Son, Inc. in 1987.\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to Pioneer Frozen Foods because the plant handles and stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of threshold quantities.  The ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in the freezers.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n1.  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause, 112(r)(1), is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Pioneer Frozen Foods is committed to the safe operation of their facility to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  Pioneer Frozen Foods, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the plant and for the community by coordinating with the local fire department.\n2.  Risk Management Plan - The ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods involves the handling and storage of one chemical, anhydrous ammonia, in excess of thresholds specified in 112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of 112(r), Pioneer Frozen Foods management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Programs have been established to prevent accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release, including maintaining a trained medical emergency response team.  In addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, Pioneer "

      "SummaryText": "Frozen Foods is in compliance with the OSHA PSM requirements and has conducted a process hazard analysis on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThere is only one RMP-covered ammonia process at Pioneer Frozen Foods - the Main System which holds a maximum of 39,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The second process, Aero-Freezer #1 System is actually below the threshold since it only contains a maximum of 3,500 pounds.  The third system, Aero-Freezer #2 System, is also below the PSM and RMP thresholds since it holds a maximum of 4,000 pounds.  These latter two systems are separate from each other and from the Main system.\n    The worst case and alternative release scenarios have been updated using EPA's guidance document, Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities (May 2004), which replaced the guidance that was used for the original offsite consequence analysis, the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC (May 1996).  A copy of Appendix E is included as Appendix E to this document. \nPioneer Frozen Foods has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  Pioneer Frozen Foods maintains current operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures; a trained medical emergency response team; and an evacuation plan for each area.  In addition, the local fire department has inspected the facility.\n\n    Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. The upgrade to the alarm system allows the siren to be heard throughout the facility instead of just in designated areas. \n\nPioneer Frozen Foods' management is committed to the following:\n-    Preventing accidents;\n-    Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n-    Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n-    Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining"

Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community.\n"
