(Bryan) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their West Point, Mississippi, facility.  Bryans operations include the manufacturing of pork and beef food products for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand name Bryan.  Bryan has been in operation at this facility for over 63 years providing quality meat products and over 2,100 jobs to the local community.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nBryan is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Bryans policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment and maintain compliance with safety, health and environmental regulations: 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHAs Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nBryan is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products. Bryan uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants.  Bryans refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping, can contain a maximum amount of 400,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are utilized in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for disinfectio"

The chlorine system can contain a maximum of 9,800 pounds while the sulfur dioxide system can contain a maximum of 6,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Bryan has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia, chlorine and sulfur dioxide using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenarios were developed following EPA regulations and are not considered to be likely release scenarios.\n\n Ammonia\nBryans worst case release scenario for ammonia is the rupture of the upper 25# accumulator (61,326 pounds when filled to 100% capacity) over a 10-minute period.  Using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) interim final draft document, Risk Management Program Guidance (40 CFR Part 68) for Ammonia Refrigeration, 1998 (Refrigeration Guidance), the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint extends offsite.  During normal operations, Bryan maintains the receiver at no more than 50% capacity.  Only during emergency or failure does the receiver have the potential to be filled to 100% of capacity.\n\nChlorine\nBryans worst case release scenario for chlorine is the rupture of one cylinder (2,000 pounds maximum capacity) over a 10-minute period.  Using EPAs Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, 1998 (WWTP Guidance), the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint extends offsite.\n\nSulfur Dioxide\nBryans worst case release scenario for sulfur dioxide is the rupture of one cylinder (2,000 pounds maximum capacity) over a 10-minute period.  Using EPAs WWTP Guidance, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint extends offsite.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAmmonia\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Bryan taking into consideration operational history and the hazards identified in the"

Bryan has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.

These safety procedures were developed by system operators and are reviewed at a frequency sufficient to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in the technology, the equipment and the facility.  Bryan encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters and training sessions.

Each preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using log sheets to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  These log sheets are maintained in the Engineering Department for three years.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical system components, equipment tests are performed. Specifically, the equipment is tested to detect corrosion. Refrigeration equipment consists of pressure vessels, headers, and piping.  Chlorination and sulfur dioxide equipment includes headers and piping.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are tested by the industrial gas supplier.  Bryan monitors and records inspection and testing data on each cylinder received.\n\nTo ensure that Bryans control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the refrigeration system. the chlorine disinfection system and sulfur dioxide dechlorination system:\n\n7 In accordance with the PSM program, Bryan conducts detailed PSM compliance audits at least every three years, typically annually.  Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\n7 In addition, Bryan is audited by the local fire department on an annual basis.\n\n7 Bryan is audited by the USDA on an continual basis.
