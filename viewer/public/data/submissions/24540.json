There are two separate refrigeration systems on site operating independent of one another. Both systems are a closed loop with normal operating  pressures of less than 200 PSI. The main plant system (process) has a maximum charge of 19,000 lbs, of ammonia contained throughout it. The Hassia system (process) has a maximum charge of 14,050 lbs, of ammonia contained throughout it. The remaining 1,450 lbs, are stored outdoors in ten 145 lb D.O.T. certified blue cylinders. \nQuantity:\n\nMaximum quantities on-site for the regulated substance are\nAmmonia (Anhydrous)-34,500 lbs.\n\n\nWorst-case scenario for a toxic substance:\n\nThe worst-case release toxic endpoint was determined using EPAs \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" Reference tables or equations. This scenario was based on the following criteria.\n\nVessel:                                   High Pressure Receiver (HPR) 3ft X 17.5 ft.\nAmount released:                    5,000 lbs\nDuration of release:                10 minutes\nRelease rate:                          500 lbs/ min\nWind speed:                            1.5 meter/sec\nAtmospheric stability:              F\nTopography:                            Urban\n\nReferencing the tables in the \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", the toxic endpoint for this scenario is 0.90 miles. Within the affected area is a population of 2,638 people, one school, two recreational areas, commercial facilities and residential areas. This information was obtained by using \"Landview\" census data. The released amount was calculated on the HPR being outdoors at full capacity and there were no mitigation factors considered.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for a toxic substance:\n\nThe alternative release toxic endpoint was determined using the EPAs \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" reference tables or equations.

The population within this area is 40 people.  Also affected are several businesses and residences.  Although considered a more likely scenario, there are many safeguards that are in place, at this facility to minimize the occurrence of such a release (see General Accidental Release Prevention Program of this Summary).\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Policies:\n\nConAgra Grocery Products has established an in-house level A emergency response \"HAZMAT\" team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 \"HAZWOPER\".  The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency.  ConAgra Grocery Products has also established training with the Fire Department personnel and community Local Emergency Planning Committee.  These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date. The Dunn County LEPC reviewed the site plan in June of 2001.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nWithin the last five years there has not been an accidental release that caused offsite impacts.\nConAgra Grocery Products have not only complied "
