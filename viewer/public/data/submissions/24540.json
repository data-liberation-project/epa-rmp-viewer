There are two separate refrigeration systems on site operating independent of one another. Both systems are a closed loop with normal operating  pressures of less than 200 PSI. The main plant system (process) has a maximum charge of 19,000 lbs, of ammonia contained throughout it. The Hassia system (process) has a maximum charge of 14,050 lbs, of ammonia contained throughout it. The remaining 1,450 lbs, are stored outdoors in ten 145 lb D.O.T. certified blue cylinders. \nQuantity:\n\nMaximum quantities on-site for the regulated substance are\nAmmonia (Anhydrous)-34,500 lbs.\n\n\nWorst-case scenario for a toxic substance:\n\nThe worst-case release toxic endpoint was determined using EPAs \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" Reference tables or equations.

The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 \"HAZWOPER\".  The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency.  ConAgra Grocery Products has also established training with the Fire Department personnel and community Local Emergency Planning Committee.  These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date. The Dunn County LEPC reviewed the site plan in June of 2001.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nWithin the last five years there has not been an accidental release that caused offsite impacts.\nConAgra Grocery Products have not only complied "
