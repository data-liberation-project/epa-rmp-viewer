This program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\r\nOur program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions in the standard.  We shall, as a minimum: a) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and b) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\r\n\r\nAccedental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe City of Waco Water Utilities Department believes that preventative maintenance and training are the keys to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\r\nThe Water Utilities Department has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, supevisors, and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release.  The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Raw Water Station uses chlorine for disinfection of the incoming water.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for this chemical asre listed below.  The chlorine is stored within a building, which will act as passive mitigation in the event of a release.\r\nChemical Maximum Inventory - Chlorine 32,000 pounds\r\nThreshold Quantity - Chlorine is 2,500 pounds\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nThere have not been any"

It is the Department's philosophy to continually improve the safe working conditions of its emploees to minimize accidents and reduce the potential for either an on-site or off-site release.  With this in mind, the Department is incoprorating many of the Risk Management Plan elements into other area of the process not covered under 40 CFR 68 to improve overall safety of the site.\r\n\r\nNOTE- THIS SITE NAME HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM THE RAW WATER PLANT BECAUSE CONSTRUCTION OF A dissolved air floatation plant IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN 2009.  AN UPDATE WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETED AND THE FACILITY IS READY TO GO ON-LINE.  The Address has changed, due to entry from Airport Road rather than Lake Shore Drive - the facility Latitude and Longitude has not changed."
