The City of Huntsville's general safety policy requires a safety program be designed and provided to safeguard all employees and minimize the frequency and severity of accidents.  WPC has on staff a Safety, Security and Training Coordinator responsible for planning, developing, and maintaining comprehensive safety, security and training programs.  WPC management and employees receive safety training and are committed to reducing and preventing hazardous conditions at all City of Huntsville Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) facilities. The WPC emergency response policy includes an emergency action plan designed for non-responding facilities involving the coordination with local emergency responders (Fire Department-HazMat Unit) and local emergency planning committee (Huntsville-Madison County Emergency Planning Committee) to ensure, in the unlikely event of accidental release, the community and environment has an effective response strategy available.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Spring Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), located at 1800 Vermont Road, Huntsville, Alabama, is a 41 million-gallon per day (MGD) conventional activated sludge facility.  Treatment processes include screening, grit removal, primary clarification, coarse bubble aeration, secondary clarification and chlorination.  Sludge treatment and processing involves gravity thickening, anaerobic digestion and dewatering using sand-drying beds. The treated effluent is then discharged to the Tennessee River.  The facility is manned by State certified wastewater treatment operators, twen"

The purpose for the chlorination process is for effluent disinfection and thus to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases. The maximum amount of chlorine on site is six (6) one-ton containers. \n\n  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe City of Huntsville ensures the Spring Branch WWTP facility is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices. The facility is designed, built and operated in accordance with all applicable Federal, state and local industry-specific regulations, codes and standards.  The equipment specifications of any equipment used to store or transfer a regulated substance are appropriate for the specific materials and operations for which it is used. \n\n\n\nWPC's accident prevention program includes routine equipment inspections and scheduled preventative maintenance.  Process and protective equipment training programs are reviewed and conducted annually to reinforce the initial level of training received by operators and maintenance personnel.  In addition, each section within WPC conducts weekly safety meetings to further enhance WPC's commitment towards accident prevention and community protection.\n\n\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nThe Spring Branch WWTP has had no reportable accidental release of chlorine that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an accidental release involving a regulated substance, WPC emergency response procedure is to notify the Huntsville Fire Department (HazMat Unit) and request that they respond to the emergency.  To ensure that an effective response is available, appropriate mechanisms are in pl"

Furthermore, emergency response efforts have been coordinated with both, the Huntsville Fire Department and the Huntsville-Madison County Emergency Planning Committee, to include this facility in the local community emergency response plan (developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, EPCRA) regarding a response to a potential release. WPC and the Huntsville Fire Department (HazMat Unit) conducted chemical release emergency response drills during January 2014 to ensure that, in the unlikely event of a regulated substance release, an effective emergency response strategy is available to protect the community and environment.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOperational and safety policies and procedures are periodically evaluated and changes implemented as needed."
