              "Description": "We take a systematic approach to preventing the accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nA?    Process Safety Information\nA?    Process Hazard Analysis\nA?    Operating Procedures and Safe Work Practices\nA?    Training and Performance\nA?    Mechanical Integrity\nA?    Quality Assurance\nA?    Management of Change-Technology\nA?    Pre-startup Reviews\nA?    Compliance Audits\nA?    Incident Investigation and Reporting\nA?    Employee Participation\nA?    Hot Work\nA?    Contractors (Safety and Performance)\nA?    Management of Change-Personnel\nA?    Emergency Planning and Response\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to full compliance with these management systems, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nOur Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the continued implementation of the elements of our Risk Management Program.  To ensure that our Risk Management Program is appropriately maintained, our Plant Manager continues to assign the role of PSM/RMP Coordinator to a member of the plant organization with the necessary background, training and experience to fulfill this position.   The PSM/RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, has the responsibility for the continued implementation and integration of the EPA RMP elements and the elements of OSHA's PSM program.\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facility's Process Safety and Risk Management Committee, a subcommittee of the site's Central Safety, Health and Environmental Committee.   This Committee is comprised of members with responsibilities that include maintaining and upgrading specific elements of our Risk Management and Process Safety Management Programs.  Managing the specific elements of our Risk Management and Process Safety Programs is a line organization function overseen by the Central Safety, Health and Environmental Committee.   The members of the Process Safety and Risk Management Committee are assigned by the Plant Manager based on recommendations from the PSM/RMP Coordinator.   Currently, the structure of the Process Safety and Risk Management Committee is as follows:\n\nProcess Safety and Risk Management Committee (PSRM),\nA subcommittee of Central Safety, Health and Environmental Committee(CSH&E)\n\nPSM/RMP Coordinator\nA?    Process Safety Information Leader\nA?    Operating Procedures and Safe Work Practices Leader\nA?    Management of Change Leader\nA?    Process Hazards Analysis Coordinator\nA?    Quality Assurance Leader\nA?    Pre-startup Safety Reviews Leader\nA?    Mechanical Integrity Leader\nA?    Training and Performance Leader\nA?    Contractor Safety and Performance Leader\nA?    Incident Investigation and Reporting Leader\nA?    Management of Change - Personnel Leader\nA?    Emergency Planning and Response Leader\nA?    Auditing Leader\n\nThe general organizational structure and the lines of authority at the DeLisle Plant for RMP implementation and compliance are as follows:\n\nPLANT MANAGER\n   Unit Manager - Reaction, Purification, Oxidation, Environmental (RPOE)\n       Area Manager - Reaction, Coke and Ore and Chlorine\n       Area Manager - Purification and Oxidation\n       Area Manager - RPOE Maintenance\n   Unit Manager - Finishing, Packaging, Distribution (FPD)/Power\n       Area Manager - Finishing/Power\n       Area Manager - Packing and Distribution\n       Area Manager - FPD/Power Maintenance/Reliability\n   Engineering Manager\n       Area Manager - Capital Projects\n       Area Manager - Operations Support & Contract Administration\n       Area Manager - Site Process Control\n       Area Manager - Information Systems \n   Unit Manager - Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE)\n       Sr. Safety & Environmental Consultant - PSM/RMP Coordinator\n       Safety Team Manager\n       Occupational Health Professional\n       Environmental Consultants (2)\n   Research and Development Supervisor\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for ensuring that the facility has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets EPA RMP and OSHA PSM requirements.   Although the PSM/RMP Coordinator has some specific individual responsibilities, many of the responsibilities for specific program elements are assigned to other members of the Process Safety and Risk Management Committee and the site's line management organization.",

Our SHE Commitment and Policy compliments our community commitment, which is that the community gives us the consent to operate to the extent that we must operate our facilities with the highest standards with the focus on operating excellence.  Our SHE Commitment and Polcy statements reflect the position of our company.   In the DuPont Commitment to Safety, Health and the Environment, it is stated that \"Through this commitment to safety, health and environmental excellence, we affirm to all our stakeholders, including our employees, customers, shareholders and the public that we will conduct our business with respect and care for the environment.\"    To accomplish these aspects of our mission and community commitment, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.   We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  DeLisle's approach to accidental release prevention is to fully comply with OSHA's PSM rule and DuPont's standard on Process Safety Management, S21A-PSM.   While complying with the OSHA rule and our own standard, we address all elements of the RMP rule for a Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe DuPont Plant at DeLisle, Mississippi is located on the north shore of the Bay of St. Louis about 15 miles west of Gulfport, Mississippi.  The facilities are situated on a 2400-acre site; however, only about 200 acres are developed.  We manufacture a single product, titanium dioxide (TiO2), under the trade name TiPure(TM).  Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride process"

Two (2) of the releases lead to shelter-in-place notifications for about 16 of our off-site residential near neighbors. The largest release was of 188 pounds of titanium tetrachloride on January 15, 2007.\n\nDeLisle's emergency response program is contained in our Emergency Procedures Manual     (EPM).  It consolidates the various regulations for emergency response planning.  It provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  We do coordinate our plan with applicable community emergency response plans and local responders.  During an emergency that involves the LEPC, the request for assistance is directed to the Harrison County Sheriff's Department, who in turn contacts other emergency organizations.  Important keys to the success of our emergency response program include:\n   \nA?    a trained on-site emergency organization,\nA?    training for all employees, including routine drills,\nA?    drills and information sharing with local emergency responders and,\nA?    the use of our Early Warning System (EWS) to alert our near neighbors.\n\nOur Emergency Operations Coordinator (sometimes referred to as the Plant Protection Coordinator - PPC) directs on-site response activities.

Some of these are PSM processes such as process hazards reviews, incident investigations and auditing.   We also make improvements as identified by DuPont and DTT Networks (PSM, safety, environmental).   These networks have membership from each of our TiO2 production sites. In addition, DeLisle makes improvements as a result of having implemented a Responsible Care Management System and an ISO 14001 Conformant Environmental Management System."
