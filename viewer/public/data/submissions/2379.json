This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our well trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC/Daviess County Sheriff's Department) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the production of various latex polymers, which falls under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 2821.  We have six regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include 1,3-Butadiene, Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile], Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], Vinylidene chloride, and a 20%, 2-4 and 80% 2-6, isomeric mixture of Toluene diisocyanate.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  1,3-Butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate and vinylidene chloride are used for manufacturing liquid latex emulsion polymers.  Toluene diisocyanate is used for manufacturing polyurethane prepolymers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] at our facility is 500,997 lb. while Vinylidene chloride [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-], 1,3-Butadiene, Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile], Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate  [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanato-2-methyl-] and Toluene 2,4-diisocya"
