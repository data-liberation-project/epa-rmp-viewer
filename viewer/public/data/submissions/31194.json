This RMP is for facility 1000 0004 1055, the second largest of the Water Treatment Plants (WTP) owned and operated by Frederick County Division of Utilities & Solid Waste Management.\n\nThis facility treats about 0.947 mgd from Lake Linganore and serves 13,341 residential customers (4941 residential accounts) and 24 commercial/industrial accounts. Ten thousand  (10,000) pounds of Chlorine is the maximum amount of chemical stored at this facility at any given time.  There are no other hazardous chemicals used or stored at or above reportable quantities at this facility.  There has never been a release of Chlorine at this facility that has escaped off-site.  This is one of two (2) Division facilities required to submit RMP data; therefore, much of the data contained in this report is similar or the same for both facilities.\n\nOn a routine basis Frederick County?s insurance carriers make site inspections of major Division facilities including the Lake Linganore WTP.  These inspections include review of policies, procedures, training programs, environmental permits, contingency plans, and Tier II inventories.  This facility haD a RMP audit in 2002.\n\n\nSECTIONS II & III\n\nBoth release scenarios used in this report use a single ton container.  With policies and procedures in place as well as the safety record of this facility, it is believed that this is the largest amount of chlorine that would be released in a single incident.\n\nThe first scenario was a Chlorine gas release that takes place over a 10 minute period of time.  This time frame is the estimated time that it would take for sensors to activate and alarm, personnel to respond with appropriate PPE and equipment"

This time frame is based on the size of the fusible plug and the emptying of the entire container.\n\n\nSECTION IV & V\n\nFrederick County Division of Utilities & Solid Waste Management does not use or store flammable chemicals/materials subject to RMP requirements; therefore no other scenarios are submitted.\n\n\nSECTION VI\n\nThe Lake Linganore WTP has an excellent safety record.  Having had no accidental releases in its history of now greater than 15 years, there is nothing to report.\n\n\nSECTION VII & VIII\n\nWhat-if & What-if/Checklists were used to update the PHA for this facility.  Review of the facility specific SOPs and Division policies and procedures are conducted annually.\n\nBecause of the critical nature of water supply, Frederick County DUSWM has built redundancy into many of its most critical processes.  This redundancy includes dual power and generators for power failures, duplicate pumps, controls, and sensors for other equipment.  Audible and visual alarms and procedures are in place for routine and emergency process control.  Automatic controls and shutoffs are equipped with manual backups in the event of power failures or other emergencies that may cause equipment control failure.\n\nThe main gate is kept locked at all times.  When Operators arrive they unlock the gate enter the facility and then lock themselves in.  Chlorine containers are stored in a block-enclosed structure adjacent to the administration and laboratory building.  The Chlorine building is not ventilated to the outside atmosphere.  Chlorine detectors are stationed at critical areas and connected to audible and visual alarms.  This system is tested routinely in accordance with established protocols.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOP) are continually reviewed and revised as necessary.   All policies a"

This program has set the benchmark for many other safety committees/programs within other Frederick County Divisions and Departments.

Formal reviews are conducted on an annual basis.  Formal reviews were conducted for this RMP Submission.  An on-the-job training (OJT) program has been implemented using both job performance checklists as well as health & safety training for performance evaluation.\n\nContractors hired to work on major projects must demonstrate that their personnel are competent to work in Confined Spaces, have Atmospheric Testing Equipment and knowledge, have appropriate Respiratory Protection and comply with other County and Division safety policies.\n\nThe DUSWM has an active Safety Committee.  This committee inspects DUSWM facilities on a periodic basis and also assists in policy review.\n\nThe DUSWM has implemented a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for tracking equipment, repairs (emergency as well as routine), preventative maintenance tasks, and resources (man-hours, parts, and equipment).\n\n\nSECTION IX\n\nThe DUSWM is a Frederick County agency that works closely with other County agencies to maintain its Emergency Response preparedness.
