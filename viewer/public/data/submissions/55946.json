The same properties that make Anhydrous Ammonia valuable as a cold storage refrigerant chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling Anhydrous Ammonia.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle Anhydrous Ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilized, and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services Group, Inc., Process Compliance, Inc., and Safety Solutions LLC.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification to Phillip McQueen (Project Engineer), German Aguilar (Safety Officer), San Angelo Fire Department, White Buffalo, Hilbig Services, Inc. (refrigeration company with Haz Mat trained responders) and then notifying 911 System for call-out to affected responding agencies.  We have discussed this program with all parties involved.  The San Angelo Fire and Police Departments will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Tom Green Co. LEPC.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is processing, cooling, and storing beef by utilizing Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in storage vessels located outside the Trolley Room, and east of the Main Plant engine room facility and also located outside on the North end of the Freezer Cold Storage facility. Anhydrous Ammonia is fed into the cooling systems for cold storage.  Both Main Plant & Freezer sy"

Other associated systems are the thermosyphon oil cooling for the compressors, liquid feed make up, air purgers, and condensing system.  Note:  The system flow diagram and control wiring diagrams should be used in conjunction with this description.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at the 2150 E. 37th Street location is Anhydrous Ammonia.  The maximum amount of Anhydrous Ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 25,000 pounds.  25,000 pounds is an aggregate found in the storage vessel and system located at the processing plant.  There is a seperate  3,500 pounds located in the storage vessel and system located in the freezer/cold storage facility, with a different mailing address, across the street. That facility was built in 2007.\r\n\r\nThis meat packing/cold storage facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nThe cold storage system was originally constructed in 1980, and underwent changes and/or additions in 2004, 2007 and 2010.  This facility is striving to be in compliance with all applicable regulations to this facility."
