The program was reviewed in 2002, by conducting the scheduled audit. The purpose of the audit was to determine if the program elements meet the regulatory requirements and to suggest improvements in the program elements that would strengthen the program. Management has addressed the findings and is working to implement the recommendations, where appropriate.",

The facility complies with regulations and good engineering practices in the operation of one process that has a greater than threshold quantity of hazardous chemicals as defined in the RMP requirements.  This process is the chlorine system.  Because of recent ruling by EPA, the digester gas and propane system are exempted from the RMP regulation because 100% of both gasses is used as a fuel on-site. It is the policy of King County to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws in the operation of all processes, and to design and operate the systems in accordance with industry standards to protect workers, visitors, and the public. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the WPTP are implemented by King County?s Department of Natural Resources and Parks, Wastewater Treatment Division.  If an un-contained release to the atmosphere were to occur in the chlorine system, it is the policy of the King County to notify the Seattle Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe WPTP is an integrated sewage treatment facility that provides both primary and secondary treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater, and storm water prior to discharge to Puget Sound.  The site takes in water from 19 pump stations in Seattle, north King County, parts of south Snohomish County, and areas east of Lake Washington.  The plant capacity is approximately 133 million gallons of sewage per day.  The chlorine system disinfects all of the wastewater following treatment before being pumped to the Puget Sound.\n\nThe general and accidental release prevention programs for the chlorine system is implemented by the King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks, Wastewat"

The facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rules, and known applicable state and local rules.  The chlorine system is designed, constructed, and operated in accordance with standard industry practice.\n\nWest Point Treatment Plant has not had a reportable accident in the last five years that involved deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or sheltering in place.  Procedures and policies are in place to record any such future events.\n\nThe emergency response program has evolved from successful existing programs to assure worker safety at the facility.  It is the policy of the King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks, Wastewater Treatment Division to notify the Seattle Fire Department and request they respond to emergency conditions at the facility.  This policy has been discussed with the fire department and they are aware of the specific chemical that exceed threshold quantities.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Division has developed a Process Safety/Risk Management Program Manual to centralize safety information and better ensure existing RMP program elements are being properly implemented at the site.  Scheduled formal audits are conducted to assure that the program is being implemented properly."
