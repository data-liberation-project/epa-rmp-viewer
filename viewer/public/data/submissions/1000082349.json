The alternative release scenario assumed that the leak would be released to the environment over a 10-minute period (the release duration did not affect the  of the affected area).  Criteria used within the RMP*Comp model included a release of 209 pounds, a release rate of 20.9 lbs/min, a wind speed of 3.0 m/sec, an atmospheric stability class of D, and urban topography.  As with the worst-case release scenario, the location of the chlorine feed equipment in the chlorine room is considered a passive mitigation measure that reduces the potential exposure to the environment by about 30 percent.  The projected area impacted by the alternative release scenario, based on the EPA model, is presented as Figure 2.  The affected area is a circle of 0.1-mile radius that only affects the CityA\u00bfs WTP and a portion of a park across the street from the WTP.

For the City's WTP, chlorine gas is the only regulated substance and the chlorine feed system is the only regulated process.  Since the worst-case release scenario modeling results indicate that the public is within the potential effected area of a chemical release, the possible prevention programs available to the City's WTP included Program 2 (default program) or Program 3 (consistent with Occupational Safety and Health Association [OSHA] program).

The CityA\u00bfs WTP uses a groundwater supply.  Treatment processes include softening, oxidation, sedimentation, filtration, corrosion control, fluoride adjustment and disinfection.  Chlorine gas is used for disinfection.  Chlorine gas is the only regulated substance addressed by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is used and/or stored at the plant.\r\n\r\nChlorine is purchased in 1-ton cylinders and stored in the chlorine cylinder storage area located at the northeast corner of the main treatment building.  During normal operating procedures, the maximum number of full cylinders at the WTP is four.  These cylinders are located within the plantA\u00bfs chlorine room and are used as the source of the chlorine feed.  Chlorine gas is fed from the cylinders by a three-eighth-inch line to two gas chlorinators where it is converted to solution.  The chlorine solution is then sent to two rotometers where it is diluted and sent to feed points within the plant.  \r\n\r\nThe City has recently developed a prevention program that addresses the accidental release of chlorine.  Written procedures for changing chlorine cylinders are maintained on file for use by employees when changing cylinders.  Employees will be required to review the procedures on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nA list of chlorine maintenance procedures is maintained on file and used by employees for the periodic checking, cleaning, and maintaining of all chlorine feed system components.  Safety information and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for chlorine and a schematic of the chlorine feed system are also maintained on file and easily accessible by plant personnel.\r\n \r\nAn Emergency Contingency Plan for the CityA\u00bfs Water Division does not currently exist; however, an emergency plan will be developed as part of the vuln"

The plan will document the emergency response policies for the WTP and will likely include detailed instructions for procedures in response to the accidental release of chlorine.  Currently, WTP employees are not to respond directly to the accidental release of chlorine but are to notify the CityA\u00bfs Fire Department.  \r\n\r\nAs a requirement of the RMP, different scenarios for the release of chlorine gas from the CityA\u00bfs WTP to the environment were performed.  The release scenarios were modeled using Environmental Protection AgencyA\u00bfs (EPAs) RMP*Comp model, and included both worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario assumes that the largest single container will release its entire contents to the environment over a ten-minute period.  For the Cuyahoga Falls WTP, the largest container is a one-ton cylinder that is located in the plantA\u00bfs chlorine room.  Criteria used within the RMP*Comp model included a release of 2,000 lbs, a release rate of 200.0 pounds per minute (lbs/min), a wind speed of 1.5 meter per second (m/sec), an atmospheric stability class of F, and urban topography.  The enclosed storage of chlorine in the chlorine room is considered a passive mitigation measure that reduces the potential exposure to the environment by approximately 30 percent.  The projected area impacted by the worst-case release scenario, based on the EPAs model, is presented as Figure 1.  The affected area is a circle of a 0.9-mile radius and includes commercial, residential, and institutional areas within the Cities of Cuyahoga Falls, Munroe Falls and Silver Lake.  The affected areaA\u00bfs population is approximately 3,400.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the worst-case release scenario is a requirement of the RMP, there is an extremely low probability that such an event would occur.  A more realistic scenario that would be encountered at the CityA\u00bfs WTP"
