This amount of storage was designed for the ultimate design capacity of the plant.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards posed to our employees, the public and the environment by our use of chlorine.\n\n\n3.0 Key Off-site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenario and an alternate release scenario for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distance for each scenario:\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical: Chlorine\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Mid-Dakota Chemical Feed Building would catastrophic failure of one full 2,000 pound container of chlorine.  The worst case is assumed to be a direct release over a 10-minute period, as required by the regulation.  The assumed meteorological conditions are 1.5 meters per second wind speed, atmospheric stability Class F (very stable, calm evening conditions and rural terrain.  Because the chlorine containers are always stored in an enclosed storage room, the release rate to the atmosphere is reduced from 200 lb/min to only 110 lb/min.  The building enclosure provides passive mitigation of the chlorine release.  Under these conditions, the EPA OCA Reference Table 11 predicts a distence of 2.2 miles to the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) of the release.  The approximate population affected by this scenario is 100, based on 1990 U.S. Census data.\n\nThe public receptors within this distance include redidences, public recreation areas and a hydroelectric power plant.  The environmental receptors within this distance include officially designated wilflife sanctuaries and refuges, federal lands, Lake Oahe and farm fields.\n\nAlternate Release"

      "SummaryText": " Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical: Chlorine\n\nThe alternate release scenario for our facility describes a situation that would be more likely to occur thatn the worst case described above, and which would affect areas off-site.  This scenario assumes the release of gas chlorine from a one-ton chlorine container, through a 5/16-inch diameter valve body opening, due to a severed connection with the tank mounted vacuum regulator.  The release duration is assumed to be 60 minutes.  The container is assumed to release 900 pounds of chlorine, at a rate of 15 lb/min.  Because the chlorine containers are always stored in an enclosed storage room, the release rate to the atmosphere is reduced from 15 lb/min to 8.25 lb/min.  The closest release rate to 8.25 lb/min on the EPA Reference Table is 10 lb/min, so the 10 lb/min release rate is used.  The building enclosure provides passive mitigation of the chlorine release.  The assumed meteorological conditions are 3.0 meters per second wind speed, atmospheric stability Class D (neutral stability, overcast conditions) and rural terrain.  Under these conditions, the EPA OCA Reference Table 24 predicts a distance of 0.2 miles to the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) of the release.  The approximate population affected by this scenario is in the range of 0 -20, based on 1990 U.S. Census data.  The actual population is about 5.\n\nThe public receptors within this distance include redidences located on land adjacent to the Chemical Feed Building.  The environmental receptors include nearby farm fields and federal land along the Lake Oahe shoreline.\n\nWe are using this infromation to help ensure that our community emergency response plan addresses all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nAdministrative controls that help prevent such releases from ever happening include proper training of all plant operators in the use of chlorination equipment.

Each time a new container is connected for use, the operator performs a leak check of all the connections to assure they are secure and properly installed.  We use an all-vacuum chlorine feed system, the safest type available, to deliver the chlorine gas from the connected containers into the treatment process.  If a feed line is accidentaly damaged or disconnected, the chlorine flow stops completely due to loss of vacuum.  We also use specialized instrumentation that provides continuous leak monitoring of the room where the chlorine is stored.  Even a small leak in the chlorine room would activate an alarm and alert the operators on duty. \n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place include:\n\n     1. Regular review of safety information such as Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), routine documentation of chlorine \n         inventory and regular updating of safety information to assure accuracy and completeness.\n     2. Hazard review of the chlorination system using industry recommended checklists to assess potential problems that could\n         result in an accidental release, determine the safeguards needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment \n         malfunctions.\n     3. Written operating procedures that address initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown,\n         emergency operation, normal shutdown, startup following a normal or emergency shutdown or a major change,\n         consequences of deviation and steps required to correct or avoid deviations, and routine equipment inspections.\n     4.

We have not had an accidental release involving chlorine since our initial start-up in October, 1997.  If an accidental release occurs, we are fully prepared and committed to conducting a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause of the event.\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an emergency action plan, which complies with the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our emergency action plan calls for us to immediately notify the Hughes County Dispatch (dial 911) and evacuate employees to a safe location.  The Hughes County Local Emergency Response Plan and the Pierre Fire Department Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan are then put into effect.  We have coordinated our action plan with the Hughes County and Pierre emergency responders.  We have also conducted a training drill with these agencies to assure that we will be prepared in the event of an actual release.\n\n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the Mid-Dakota Chemical Feed Building to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n     1.
