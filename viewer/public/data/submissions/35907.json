The alternative case scenario represents a release that (1) may occur at a facility like the Androscoggin Mill; and (2) would result in the greatest offsite consequences, should a release occur.  The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public as a result of a accidental release.  This is called the endpoint distance.  The following information summarizes the finding of the analysis performed.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn 1992, the mill began a formal prevention program for the chlorine dioxide generation and storage processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of IP\u00bfs prevention program that address the EPA prevention program requirements.\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program:  The program 3 prevention plan applies to the chlorine dioxide generation and storage processes, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.\tProcess Safety Information\n2.\tProcess Hazards Analysis\n3.\tOperation Procedures\n4.\tTraining (Operation & Maintenance)\n5.\tMechanical Integrity\n6.\tManagement of Change\n7.\tPre-Startup Safety Review\n8.\tCompliance Audit\n9.\tIncident Investigation\n10.\tEmployee Participation\n11.\tHot Works Permits\n12.\tContractors\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no ClO2 incidents that have affected the surrounding community in the past five years.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIP has developed a written emergency response program to aid in the response of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n1.\tinforming the local fire department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in off-site consequences.\n2.\tproviding proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accide"

As part of this commitment, the mill has established a system to ensure safe operation of the processes at the facility.   One component of this system is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that aids in the management of hazardous chemical safety in the mill; in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) regulation 40 CFR, part 68.  One of the requirement of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan), describing the risk management program at the mill. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the rule as it applies to the mill.\n\nThe risk management plan (RMPlan) was originally submitted on June 21, 1999 for the Androscoggin Mill and this information was shared with the public at a meeting with the town of Jay on January 13, 2000.  This information remains available for the public through the town of Jay and the local LEPC, headquartered in Farmington, Maine.\n\nThe risk management program at the mill consists of three elements:\n1.\ta hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases; and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the regulated substance  (Chlorine dioxide) regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n2.\ta prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered process).\n\n3.\tan emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from the covered process.\n\nInternational Paper limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Mill, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  Considerations are taken with also the existing chemical"

For example, chlorine, methanol and ammonia have been replaced with alternative, non-RMP covered chemicals.\n\nWhen a hazardous substance is used at the mill (ClO2), the equipment has been designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the chemical.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the process; including studying all safety aspects of the process through the Hazard and Operability studies (HazOps) and following OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management standard  (1910.119).\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe mill is committed to the safety of the workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment, throught the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, the mill controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers as well as minimize impact to the public or the environment.  IP provides training to all personnel, has a designated emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinated response efforts with the local fire department.  These response activities are documented and discussed with the LEPC.\n\nINTERNATIONAL PAPER, ANDROSCOGGIN MILL \u00bf REGULATED SUBSTANCE\t\n\nThe Androscoggin Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill, primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and finished paper products.  As part of this process, the mill manufactures and stores chlorine dioxide (ClO2) above the threshold quantity as provided in 40 CFR 68.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe Androscoggin Mill has performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine dioxide, and how it would affect the public and the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both a worst-case scenario as well as an alternative release scenario.  The Androscoggin M"
