We will provide a safe and productive workplace for our employees, conduct our operations in an environmentally responsible manner, comply with applicable laws and regulations and improve the communities where we live and work. We recognize that operating excellence does not just happen, and that we need to have management tools in place to organize and sustain the effort. \n\nAchieving excellence in our operations is the responsibility of every employee.  Operations line management must ensure the development and implementation of procedures which guide employee actions as appropriate.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention And Response Policies\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training, engineering controls in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent accidental and uncontrolled releases of regulated substances.\n\nDescription Of The Stationary Source And Regulated Substances\nThe   Dollarhide Gas Plant is located in Andrews County, Texas 35 miles southwest of Andrews on Highway   128.  The plant?s dehydration and cryogenic operational process produces a C2+ NGL product and a dry residue gas from accumulated casing head gas production.  The regulated flammables included in this process are ethane plus liquid product (C2+ NGL), and Propane HD storage that is utilized for refrigeration in the plant process. The Dollarhide Gas Plant does not use and/or process any regulated toxic substances above threshold quantities.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe  WCS  associated with a release of  flammable substances in the Program Level 1 process  is  a  vapor  cloud  explosion  (VCE) involving the full inventory of the natural gas  "

Although numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences exist, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the WCS.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nProgram Level 1 processes do not require an accident prevention program. The Dollarhide Gas Plant has implemented an accident prevention program to satisfy the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  PSM requirements are consistent with the regulations outlined in the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Dollarhide Plant.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and accident prevention.  Employees participate in review, compilation and updating technical documents and chemical inventories.  Employees participate as Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team members.\n\nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include monthly safety meeting, planned inspections and operation improvement meetings which include affected plant personnel and management.   \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties   and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design criteria.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response, PPE requirements and exposure treatment consideratio"

This information includes construction materials, design limits, and electrical rating of equipment. The combination of appropriately trained personnel, written procedures and PSI data provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance intervals and procedures. Proposed design or process modifications are reviewed through the Management of Change (MOC) process to ensure that safety features and material of construction in the process are not compromised. \n\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  This program systematically examines the process to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage the identified hazards.\n\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant personnel use various PHA processes including the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and Check List techniques to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are initiated and tracked until completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nReviews are conducted at least  every  five years  and  will  be conducted at  this  frequency until  the  process  is no longer  operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant maintains written procedures that add"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the MOC process. In addition, the Dollarhide Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter in the DCS System that provides alarm notification for excess process control deviations. This information, along with written operating procedures is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \nTraining\nComplemented by the written procedures the Dollarhide Gas Plant personnel maintain job proficiency through mentoring and training opportunities. New employees are initiated to the process operations through their involvement in the maintenance responsibilities.  Once operations fundamentals are established, the new employees are mentored by a senior plant operator or the plant foreman.  Process operating responsibilities are transferred to the new employee after observations indicate the new employee exhibits sufficient proficiency in the process operations. All operators  periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. \n\n\n \nContractors\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n1.    Participate in Contractor / Visitor Orientation   \n2.    Perform their work in a safe manner\n3.    Have appropriate knowledge and skills\n4.    Aware of the hazards in their workplace\n5.    "

Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety and performance obligations. Contractors are allowed to obtain additional training by attending the Pure Resources Safety Meetings at the Dollarhide Gas Plant.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification   that requires a    change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides a final check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that prevention requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant has  well-established practices and  procedures to maintain  pressure vessels,  piping systems, pressure relief, vent systems, operating controls, pumps, compressors,  and  emergency shutdown  systems  in a safe operating  condition.
