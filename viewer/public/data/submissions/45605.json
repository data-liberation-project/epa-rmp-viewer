One of the chemicals used in the disinfection process is Chlorine.  \n\nThe water treatment plant purchases chlorine in one (1) ton steel cylinders and are kept in an enclosed building with a ventilation system that is connected to a Chlorine Scrubber System.  This Scrubber system is automatically engaged when chlorine gas is detected in the room.  The maximum quantity stored at the water treatment facility is 12,000 pounds.\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies and Chemical specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Stillwater Water Treatment Plant is dedicated to the safety of their employees and to the citizens living in the area.  The water plant utilizes employee training, written policies, maintenance procedures, technology, and emergency backup systems to achieve a safe working environment and to limit the potential of a chlorine gas release to the atmosphere. \n \nTraining:  \nAll new employees work with an experienced plant operator to achieve on the job training.\n\nAnnually, all employees, must receive 4 hours renewal training as per Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality rules and regulations for license recertification.\n\nAll Stillwater employees attend quarterly safety training under PEOSH regulations.\nAll water plant employees attend monthly safety meetings.\n\nChlorine System Policy\n\nTwo operators will always be present when working on chlorine cylinders or in the chlorine room.\n\nThe exhaust fan will be turned on before operator enters the chlorine building.\n\nOne of the two operators will remain outside of the chlorine room and observe the other operator while he is in the room.\n\nWhen changing leads from one cylinder to another cylinder, a new lead washer will always be used.\n\nOperators will immediately notify"
