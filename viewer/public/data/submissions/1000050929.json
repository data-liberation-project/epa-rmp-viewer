The chlorination system is designed to provide a metered flow of chlorine from six, one-ton containers equipped with automatic switchover equipment.  There can be up to twenty-four, one-ton containers on site including empty cylinders (approximately 48,000 pounds of chlorine if all cylinders were full) at the facility.  Flow from the one-ton containers is directed through flexible tubing into a hard piping system.  The system operates under a positive pressure flow and can be isolated at three points.  The three points are the container valves, the header valves, and the vaporizer valves.  Under normal conditions, the chlorination system draws from the six one-ton containers simultaneously through a main header system.  There are two scales, each containing six, one-ton containers on trunnions, and the automatic switchover system controls the scale from which chlorine is drawn.\r\n\r\n\tThe Buffalo Water Treatment Plant endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to its employees, customers, and the community by providing employees educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers both on and off the job.  The Buffalo Water Treatment Plant's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of chlorine into locations that could potentially expose employees and the community to serious hazards.  An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system.  Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and employees alike.  The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of chlorine into locations that could expose employees and residents to serious hazards is of primary concern.\r\n\r\n\tVeolia Water and the Buffalo Water Treatment Plant have developed this program in accordance with OSHA Ti"

The program is designed to inform all employees of the hazards of chlorine, procedures for the safe use of chlorine, and the steps taken for the safety of employees in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency action plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, employee training, etc.).  In addition, Veolia Water/Buffalo Water Treatment Plant has generated an emergency preparedness plan and a chemical emergency management plans for response procedures to chlorine releases and has coordinated it with the City of Buffalo Fire Department.  The Buffalo Water Treatment Plant has experienced and well trained operators that have worked extensively with the chlorination system.  Training of employees is well documented and implemented at the facility.\r\n\r\n\tThe Buffalo Water Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\r\n\r\n\tThe Buffalo Water Treatment Plant managed by Veolia Water has developed an emergency action plan in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(n), OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, and USEPA 40 CFR 68.90.  The Buffalo Water Treatment Plant has coordinated all emergency response activities with the City of Buffalo HAZMAT Team and Fire Department, and the City of Buffalo HAZMAT will perform all HAZMAT activities at the facility.  In addition, The Buffalo Water Treatment Plant and Veolia Water have also coordinated with the Erie County HAZMAT team to assist the City of Buffalo HAZMAT team during emergency responses.  The emergency action plan establishes the procedures necessary to follow in case of a chlorine release as well as the order of notification for off-site responders.  Employees will receive the training required to recognize a chlorine release and to initiate the emergency action plan procedures by notifying the proper authorities.  Table top emergency drills and evacuation drills are conducted periodically that simulate potential emergen"
