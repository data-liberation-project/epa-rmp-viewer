Should any releases be detected by the monitoring equipment, the following activities will occur: (1) a physical alarm will sound  (2) the alarm system will send a signal to the third party monitoring company  (3) the scrubber system will activate and the internal air will be filtered through a scrubber solution until the levels of the detected release are abated.  The Compressed Gas Building is also equipped with a monitoring system for Fire by a Third Party company as well.\n\nIn the event of a loss of power, the facility monitoring systems will remain active.  The entire facility is equipped with a backup generator of sufficient size to maintain power to the facility for a minimum of 3 days without the supply of power from the City of Nampa.   \n\nFive Year Accident History\nISS&D is a newly formed company in operation beginning 9/1/10, thus there have been no accidents or releases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nIn the event of release of a RMP Chemical Regulated Product, ISS&D has implemented a number of safety devices to minimize any risk to employees or the community as described in the Facility Security & Safety section of this document.
