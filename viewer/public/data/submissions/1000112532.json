There is no data to report.\n\n1.5 The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Personnel are trained to notify and evacuate via the Emergency Action Plan.  Only the Fire Department would respond to an emergency; support would be made available via WPS personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards.  Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  Written ammonia emergency response procedures are detailed in the facility\u0092s \u0093Thirty Minute Plan\u0094.

The water system provides evaporative cooling of the tank skin which reduces the pressure in the vessel.  Pressure Relief Valves are installed on the vessels per the applicable codes.\n\nMaintenance is performed on the vessels and/or associated equipment in the winter months when they are usually empty.  New pressure relief valves are scheduled for installation every 5 years per industry standards.   A vapor compressor and 3-way valve system provide the means to transfer refrigerant to or from the vessels.  The compressor and hose system is inspected regularly for damage, wear, and tear.  Locked storage for transfer hoses was added in January 2004.  The evaporative cooling water system\u0092s actuator switch is tested annually for proper operation. \n\nOther release prevention steps taken at WPS - Yuma Shop:\n?\tThe storage vessel system at WPS/Yuma Shop differs from other storage systems (fertilizer terminals) in this way. The transfer activity takes place during a few weeks per year whereas a typical terminal will have daily transfer activity. WPS feels that this minimum number of transfers provides a reduction in risk and exposure.\n?\tWritten procedures detail the steps necessary to safely transfer ammonia in or out of the vessels.\n?\tOnly SOP-trained technicians are authorized to perform transfer activities.\n?\tPolicy requires two or more qualified personnel present to perform transfers.\n?\tEmployees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandals etc. or other potential wrong do-ers\n?\tStaff are trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.

These vessels are ASME Certified.\n\nProduce growing and shipping is a seasonal event in Yuma.  Typically, fresh vegetables come into season in November and finish in April.  When cooling equipment is taken out of service in the spring, the refrigerant is transferred out of that equipment and stored in vessels at WPS-Yuma Shop.

The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of the Storage Facility operation.  The facility does not qualify for the PSM Program (>10,000 lbs NH3) during ON Season (Fall/Winter: November \u0096 April). At that time the ammonia is being used in off-site equipment.

The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program.  The company safety program includes but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases.  It is the primary goal of WPS to protect employees, visitors, and neighbors from harm due to company operations.\n\nWPS has adopted a \u0093non-responding facility\u0094 policy; has an established Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department is performed on an ongoing basis.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submittal of appropriate Reports, involvement with Fire Department and LEPC planning Yuma Ammonia Safety Days, and periodic tours of the facility.  \n\nWPS policy also includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.  Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  The company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training.\n\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe WPS-Yuma Shop is an ammonia refrigeration service center 100% owned and operated by WPS.
