      "SummaryText": "CYPRESS CREEK WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT \n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR CHLORINATION PROCESS \n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nThe Cypress Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is strongly committed to \n\nemployee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a \n\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that integrates areas such \n\nas design, installation, management practices, operating procedures, maintenance, and \n\nemployee training associated with the chlorination process at our facility. The \n\nchlorination system at our plant is designed to meet industry standards and is well \n\nmaintained. Appropriate controls and alarms are also in place to prevent possible \n\nreleases of chlorine. Furthermore, all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental \n\nProtection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program Level 2 are adhered to. \n\n\n\nIn the event an accidental release does occur, our facility is coordinated with the \n\nLauderdale County Emergency Management Agency, local fire and police departments, \n\nas well as, Harcross Chemicals in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. These institutions provide \n\nhighly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate effects of the \n\nrelease. \n\n\n\n2. Our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\nOur facility is a publicly owned wastewater treatment plant. Our primary \n\nactivity is treating municipal wastewater from the City of Florence, AL for discharge \n\ninto the Tennessee River. We have one regulated substance, Chlorine. Chlorine is \n\nused for disinfecting the wastewater and to aid in plant operation. The maximum \n\ninventory of Chlorine at our facility is 16,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario \n\nTwo possible chlorine release scenarios, a ?worst case release? and ?alternative \n\nscenario? were analyzed in accordance with EPA?s RMP regulations. To perform the \n\nrequired scenario analyses for our facility, we used reference "

The following paragraphs provide details of the \n\nchosen scenarios. \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario, as required by EPA, assumes the maximum quantity \n\nof chlorine in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an \n\nunspecified failure. Our largest vessel is a ton (2,000 pounds) container. Neither \n\npassive nor active mitigation was considered. At class F atmospheric stability, a 1.5 \n\nm/s windspeed, and a temperature of 101F, a maximum distance of 3.04 miles is \n\nobtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L. The potentially affected \n\nresidential population was estimated to be approximately 22,851. Several public \n\nreceptors and one environmental receptor, the Seven Mile Island Wildlife Refuge, were \n\nidentified in the toxic endpoint area. \n\n\n\nPage 1 of 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes the chlorine release is less severe and is \n\nmore likely to occur than the worst case release scenario. The scenario chosen involves \n\na tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through \n\nthe 5/16 diameter valve body opening. The total quantity released is 317 pounds with \n\nan average release rate of 5.28 pounds per minute and a maximum sustained release \n\nrate of 10.5 pounds per minute. At class D atmospheric stability, a 3.0 m/s windspeed, \n\nand a temperature of 101F, a maximum distance of 0.57 miles is obtained \n\ncorresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L. The potentially affected residential \n\npopulation was estimated at 2305. A few public receptors and one environmental \n\nreceptor, the Seven Mile Island Wildlife Refuge, were identified in the toxic endpoint \n\narea. \n\n\n\n4.

This checklist was designed to meet the requirements of The \n\nChlorine Manual published by The Chlorine Institute. The analyses are performed by \n\nqualified personnel and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the \n\nhazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n Operating Procedures \n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorination process, \n\nour facility maintains written operating procedures.
