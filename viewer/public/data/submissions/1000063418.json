The principal fuels produced are gasoline and diesel.  The refinery produces Propane and Butane for commercial purposes.  In addition, the refinery produces anhydrous Ammonia and elemental Sulfur for the agricultural market, as well as petroleum coke used by power plants.  The refinery also supplies Carbon Dioxide to Air Liquide for the manufacture of dry ice.  The refinery accomplishes the production of these products from crude oil through the use of many complex processing units.  The refinery processes San Joaquin Valley Crude, Alaskan North Slope Crude and a large variety of other crudes.  San Joaquin Valley Crude is an example of a heavy oil, rich in sulfur and nitrogen.  Heavy oils must be converted to lighter hydrocarbons in order for it to be useable as motor fuels.  In addition, the sulfur and nitrogen must be removed from the oil distillates during processing to produce motor fuels that produce fewer emissions upon combustion by cars and trucks.

An overall block flow diagram of the refinery is included in Attachment B.\n\n\n\nCrude Oil begins its journey through the refinery at the Crude Units.  Desalters dehydrate the oil and remove salts electrically to reduce the oil's corrosivity.  It is then sent to the distillation tower where the hydrocarbons are heated and separated into fractions by molecular weight.  Lighter hydrocarbons have lower boiling points than heavier hydrocarbons.  The distillation tower produces six fractions:  wet gas/butanes, gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, gas oil and resid.  The heaviest component, resid, is sent to the Feed Prep units for further distillation under vacuum.  After vacuum distillation, the Feed Prep bottom product, which is made up of very heavy hydrocarbons and is solid at ambient temperature,  is sent to the Delayed Coker Unit (DCU).  The DCU thermally cracks large molecules into smaller ones.  These smaller molecules can then be further processed into motor fuels.  The DCU also produces petroleum coke, which is black carbon powder.\n\n\n\nThe gas oil fractions from the Crude Units, the Feed Prep Units, and the Coker are still too heavy for use as motor fuels.  These fractions are catalytically cracked in the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) and/or the Hydrocracker Unit.  Both of these units crack the hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules in the presence of a catalyst.  Catalytic cracking is more selective than thermal cracking.  The FCCU cracking breaks long chain hydrocarbons into short chains and multi-ring compounds into smaller ring compounds.  In addition, olefin compounds (unsaturated hydrocarbons) are generated.  Olefins are undesirable in motor fuels because they contribute to the formation of emissions during engine combustion.  The olefins are removed by other process units.

These units also saturate olefins.  The HDS units are particularly important for ensuring cleaner burning gasoline, since the removal of these compounds is critical to reducing emissions from engine combustion of gasoline and diesel.  The Hydrodearomatization (HDA) unit removes aromatic compounds from diesel fractions, a necessary step in the production of producing cleaner burning fuels.  The Reformer rearranges hydrocarbons from straight chains into branched chains, rings and aromatics; these compounds are desirable because they raise the octane number of the motor fuels.  Aromatic compounds created by the Reforming units are saturated in the Benzene Saturation Unit, ensuring their removal from clean fuel production.  The Alkylation Unit combines two small molecules, a branched hydrocarbon and an olefin, to make a larger branched hydrocarbon.  This process generates alkylate, which is a high octane blending component in gasoline.  The Alkylation Unit uses Sulfuric Acid as a catalyst.  \n\n\n\nThe cracking processes produce very small hydrocarbons as well as the larger fractions discussed above.

A scribe takes notes for the team during the PHA.  \n\n\n\nCurrently, the primary PHA methodology used at the refinery is the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methodology.  The What-If and Checklist methodologies are used to supplement the HAZOP methodology when appropriate.  Complex processing units require the use of more detailed PHA methodology like HAZOP.  A HAZOP is a detailed review of the process in a systematic fashion to determine whether process deviations can lead to undesirable consequences.  Detailed Process Safety Information is required to perform a HAZOP, since the review process proceeds line-by-line through the processing unit.  The team lists potential causes and consequences of deviation as well as existing safeguards protecting against the deviation.  When the team finds that an inadequate protection exists for a credible deviation, then recommendations are developed to enhance safeguards.  The What-If methodology is a brainstorming approach about possible undesired events.  It is not as structured as the HAZOP, but allows for process safety concerns to be brought forward in a less rigid approach.  The Checklist methodology consists of a written list of items or procedural steps to verify the status of a system.  Development of generic hazard checklists allows this method to be used in combination with other PHA methods.  The use of these three methodologies together increases the probability of discovering hazards.  \n\n\n\nEach PHA performed at the refinery systematically examines potential deviations and their consequences.

The PHA also reviews other issues such as:  safety/fire protection, emergency response, procedures, loss of utilities, previous incidents, facility siting, human factors, testing and inspection, maintenance and external events. During each PHA, a human factors checklist is used to identify any human factor issues.  The objective of this checklist is to identify and make recommendations to correct any deficiencies in the human/process interface.  This checklist addresses human factors both in the field and the control room.  Examples of some of the items covered include:  the labeling and positioning of valves and other instruments, layout of process controls, clarity of procedures, and emergency equipment locations.

The explosion analysis involves the use of consequence modeling to identify any buildings that may be impacted beyond their generic overpressure response limit.  The fire analysis involves a comparison of the separation distance between each building and the nearest source of flammable material to determine if the occupants can safely evacuate the building.  The toxic analysis involves the use of dispersion modeling for Hydrogen Sulfide, Ammonia, Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide, and determination of Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 3 (ERPG-3) levels.  \n\n\n\nThe PHA team analyzes the PHA findings, risk ranks them and develops appropriate recommendations.

These include the San Andreas, Hayward, Rodgers Creek, Green Valley, Concord, Greenville, and the Calaveras faults.  Fault rupture within the refinery units was not considered.  The performance criteria used in the current seismic studies include evaluating the processes for the following: maintaining structural integrity (will it stay standing?), maintaining position (will it move and affect something else?), and maintaining containment of the material (will it keep its contents inside?).  \n\n\n\nThe method used to perform these seismic studies was a seismic walkdown.  This is an evaluation method involving the physical inspection of the process by a qualified engineer.  It is primarily a visual review that considers the actual condition of each installation in a systematic manner.  This method is generally referred to as a \"walkdown\" review, because engineers performing the review systematically walk down each equipment item, building, or system to look for potential seismic vulnerabilities.  The walkdown review emphasizes the primary seismic load resisting elements and the potential areas of weakness due to design, construction, or modification practices as well as deterioration or damage.  A special emphasis is placed on details that may have been designed without consideration of seismic loads.  The walkdown review may also include a limited review of drawings.

The Inspectors perform or oversee specific tests after the repair is complete to assure that the repair has been performed properly and with appropriate materials.  The nature of the tests used for quality assurance depends upon the type of work performed and is typically specified by an Inspector.  To assure the proper material has been used in building or repairing a process, the refinery has a Positive Materials Identification Procedure.  This procedure involves the use of an analyzer capable of identifying metal alloys.  Rotating equipment quality assurance is performed by competent personnel.  They perform visual inspections, pressure testing (where and when applicable) and start-up checks.  In addition, spare parts original manufacturer's number is tracked along with the manufacturer provided documentation (material certification papers) to ensure the right parts have been installed into the proper service.

Prior to performance of any tasks, contractor employees fill out a checklist (a job hazard analysis) from the Contractor employer that covers performance of the safe work practices covered by the permitting program.  This checklist is kept with the permitting package during the performance of the work.  In addition, the refinery's Eagle Eye program for reporting unsafe situations/conditions includes contractors.  This allows for contractors to communicate information about hazards to refinery personnel.

This program addresses emergency response for fires, explosions, releases of hazardous materials and medical emergencies.  The ERP addresses coordination with local agencies and the public.  The ERP has been prepared in coordination with the local emergency response area plan as required by CalARP, RMP and ISO.  In addition, the ERP contains the Oil Spill Contingency Plan, the Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan and the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan as annexes.  The refinery's current ERP was issued in May, 2015.  The plan is reviewed on a regular basis to assure that the plan represents the most effective approach for protecting workers, the public and the environment.  It may be revised if any of the following activities indicate the need for a change:  applicable federal, state or local regulatory changes, the ERP fails in an emergency, significant changes in facility operation occurs, the emergency contact list changes, changes occur in emergency response equipment or procedures, or a review reveals a deficiency in the ERP.\n\n\n\nNotification:\n\n\n\nIn the event of a serious fire, explosion, hazardous material release, or medical emergency, employees or contractors call 2222 and report the nature of the emergency to Security Control.

Security Control also pages the appropriate emergency response groups.  For emergencies isolated to a single process unit, the unit horn will sound six short blasts.  Two short blasts on the refinery-wide horn indicate an \"All Clear\".  The Chemical Plant has supplementary signals in addition to the refinery's signals.  The supplemental signals include one continuous blast indicating an emergency, a series of short blasts indicating the need for evacuation of the plant, a series of \"wow-wow-wow\" blasts indicating a Hydrogen Sulfide release and a long-short-long blast indicating an \"All Clear\".  \n\n\n\nThe emergency action plan requirements are included in the Emergency Response Plan.  It describes employee actions for the evacuation of process areas.  If any of the emergency alerts are sounded, workers have been instructed to immediately stop work, shut down any ignition sources, and proceed to a designated employee gathering area.  Emergencies requiring employee evacuation will have an evacuation announcement immediately following the alert.  Employees then proceed to designated evacuation areas where they are counted.  All employees receive initial training on emergency actions via a safety orientation when they are hired.  In addition, every year employees receive refresher training on this subject; it is covered in an annual CBT training and an annual safety class.  All Contractor employees receive initial training and annual refresher training in this area as well.  The emergency alarms for employees are regularly tested.
