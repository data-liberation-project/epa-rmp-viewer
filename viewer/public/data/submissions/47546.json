In addition, our employees have access to all information developed through implementation of the RMP, including information resulting from process hazard analysis.\n\nContractors \u00bf DP&L develops partnerships with contractors to effectively conduct business and operate generation facilities, especially in maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, DP&L evaluates the qualifications of the contractor including their safety performance.  Procedures are in place to ensure that contractors are properly informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00bfs work and the process involved, including the emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nV. Five Year Accident History\n\nThe ammonia facility does not have an accident history.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe part 68 rule distinguishes between those facilities which will respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and those which will not.  The requirements for non-responding facilities are covered in Section 68.90 of the rule.  To determine whether a facility is a responding one, the EPA interpretation of \u00bfresponse\u00bf is commonly used.  It is the definition of response used in the OSHA HAZWOPER standard in 29 CFR 1910.120(a)(3).  \n\nThe standard defines \u00bfresponse\u00bf as \u00bfa response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders\u00bfto an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.\u00bf  This definition specifically excludes responses to incidental releases, which are those \u00bfwhere there is no potential safety or health hazard.\u00bf  Such hazards include fire, explosion, or chemical exposure.  If the release of the chemical is substantial or clearly growing in size, the leak is no longer considered incidental and employees should not respond unless they are specif"

These are (1)emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; (2) procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; (3) procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; (4) rescue and medical duties for those employees who are to perform them; (5) the preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies; and (6) names or regular job titles of persons or departments who can be contacted for further information or explanation of duties under plan.\n\nDP&L has an emergency action (not response) plan in place to address and react to accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes such requirements as adequate first aid and medical treatment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and qualified contractor responder for post-incident response and decontamination of affected areas.  The plan will be promptly updated to address any pertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the emergency action plan.

The prevention program includes assuring all process equipment and materials meet appropriate standards and code requirements, implementation of detailed safe operating procedures, an effective maintenance program, and a training program to assure that all personnel are thoroughly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia system.  Process controls include relief valves, check valves, automatic and manual shutoffs, excess flow devices, interlocks, alarms and procedures.  Sudden surges in flow or pressure will cause automatic shutoff valves, located above valve ends of tanks, to close and isolate the system.

The process contains an anhydrous ammonia storage facility, including four, 65,000 gallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, vapor compressors and liquid transfer pumps, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a gas, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject ammonia into a selective catalytic reduction emission control system.\n\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility \u00bf anhydrous ammonia.  With four 65,000 gallon storage tanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any time is 1,200,000 pounds and the maximum amount contained in the largest single vessel is 300,000 pounds.\n\nIII. Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were identified and analyzed to determine the distance to endpoint for each assumed release.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, the very conservative EPA RMP*Comp model was used.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 65,000-gallon storage tank.  A maximum release of 300,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period was considered.  The released quantity was not limited by a system of administrative controls.  Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to 6.1 miles before reaching the specified toxic endpoint level of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario involves the release of 700 pounds of ammonia from the rupture of the 2\u00bf ammonia feed line to the vaporizers.  Under typical meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to .2 miles"

The What-If analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations.  Findings from the analysis were addressed.  The What-If analysis was conducted on March 27-29, 2001, a revalidation was conducted on September 6, 2001, and a pre-startup safety review was conducted on January 4, 2002.  The original Process Hazard Analysis was updated on December 13, 2006.  Findings from the analysis will be addressed.\n\nOperating Procedures \u00bf DP&L has established and maintains procedures for safely conducting activities within our covered process.  The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.  The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\nTraining \u00bf DP&L\u00bfs training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the process and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.
