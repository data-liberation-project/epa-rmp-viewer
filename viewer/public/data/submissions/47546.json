DP&L also assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, use effective environmental processes, and are held accountable for performance.\n\nDP&L management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties.  We will assure environmental protection and reduce risks to our employees and to the communities in which we operate through review of new developments, safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness.

The process contains an anhydrous ammonia storage facility, including four, 65,000 gallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, vapor compressors and liquid transfer pumps, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a gas, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject ammonia into a selective catalytic reduction emission control system.\n\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility ? anhydrous ammonia.  With four 65,000 gallon storage tanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any time is 1,200,000 pounds and the maximum amount contained in the largest single vessel is 300,000 pounds.\n\nIII. Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were identified and analyzed to determine the distance to endpoint for each assumed release.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, the very conservative EPA RMP*Comp model was used.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 65,000-gallon storage tank.  A maximum release of 300,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period was considered.  The released quantity was not limited by a system of administrative controls.  Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to 6.1 miles before reaching the specified toxic endpoint level of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario involves the release of 700 pounds of ammonia from the rupture of the 2? ammonia feed line to the vaporizers.  Under typical meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to .2 miles"

DP&L maintains documentation of safety information concerning chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs and specification associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis ? DP&L conducted detailed analyses of the process to ensure that hazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively.  The What-If analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations.  Findings from the analysis were addressed.  The What-If analysis was conducted on March 27-29, 2001, a revalidation was conducted on September 6, 2001, and a pre-startup safety review was conducted on January 4, 2002.  The original Process Hazard Analysis was updated on December 13, 2006.  Findings from the analysis will be addressed.\n\nOperating Procedures ? DP&L has established and maintains procedures for safely conducting activities within our covered process.  The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.  The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\nTraining ? DP&L?s training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the process and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.  The personnel are provided with refresher training at least every three years or more often if needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity ? DP&L conducts well documented ma"

All maintenance operations conducted on the covered process are performed by qualified personnel who have had proper training.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and safely.\n\nManagement of Change ? DP&L maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process equipment, procedures and monitoring technology.  Personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Review ? A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new process.  Established pre-startup safety review procedures will assure that construction, equipment, operating maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits ? DP&L will conduct audits of the risk management plan at least every three years.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely implemented.  The last compliance audit conducted at Stuart Station was completed on 11/15/06.\n\nIncident Investigations ? Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance is promptly investigated.  Procedures ensure that investigations are undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident.  Corrective action will be taken to ensure that the situation leading to the incident does not reoccur.  All investigation reports will be retained for at least 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation ?

DP&L develops partnerships with contractors to effectively conduct business and operate generation facilities, especially in maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, DP&L evaluates the qualifications of the contractor including their safety performance.  Procedures are in place to ensure that contractors are properly informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and the process involved, including the emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nV. Five Year Accident History\n\nThe ammonia facility does not have an accident history.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe part 68 rule distinguishes between those facilities which will respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and those which will not.  The requirements for non-responding facilities are covered in Section 68.90 of the rule.  To determine whether a facility is a responding one, the EPA interpretation of ?response? is commonly used.  It is the definition of response used in the OSHA HAZWOPER standard in 29 CFR 1910.120(a)(3).  \n\nThe standard defines ?response? as ?a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders?to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.?  This definition specifically excludes responses to incidental releases, which are those ?where there is no potential safety or health hazard.?  Such hazards include fire, explosion, or chemical exposure.  If the release of the chemical is substantial or clearly growing in size, the leak is no longer considered incidental and employees should not respond unless they are specif"

This part of the standard describes the elements of an emergency action plan.  These are (1)emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; (2) procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; (3) procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; (4) rescue and medical duties for those employees who are to perform them; (5) the preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies; and (6) names or regular job titles of persons or departments who can be contacted for further information or explanation of duties under plan.\n\nDP&L has an emergency action (not response) plan in place to address and react to accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes such requirements as adequate first aid and medical treatment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and qualified contractor responder for post-incident response and decontamination of affected areas.  The plan will be promptly updated to address any pertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the emergency action plan.
