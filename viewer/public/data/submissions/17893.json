RP-2 occupies 27.48 acres of land adjacent to the northeast side of\nChino Creek slightly less than l/4 mile northeast of the intersection of California State Highway\n71 and Euclid Avenue. The facility is surrounded primarily by undeveloped land and is in an\nagricultural preserve. The El Prado Golf Course extends north, east and south of RP-2. The\nAgency also operates two other stationary sources subject to the federal RMP regulations.\nSeparate RMPs have been submitted for those facilities.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as\nset forth in Section 25535(d) of Article 2 of Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety\nCode (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program - CalARP) and Part\n68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR Part 68), also known as the federal\nAccidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs or the federal RMP.\n\nThe scope of the RMP includes all operations conducted at the RP-2 facility which involve the\nstorage, handling and/or use of chlorine and methane contained in digester gas (i.e., chlorine and\nmethane contained in digester gas are the only regulated substances which are handled at the\nfacility above the threshold quantity).\n\nES 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nHANDLED\n\nSince its inception, the Inland Empire Utilities Agency has evolved with the growth and needs of\nthe western portion of San Bernardino County. Today, the Agency distributes imported water and\nprovides municipal/industrial wastewater collection and treatment services for a 242-square mile\narea that includes more than 600,000 people.\n\nRP-2 has been in operation since 1960 and serves the cities of Chino, Chino Hills, Ontario,\nRan"

The primary operation conducted at RP-2 is wastewater\ntreatment. As a part of this process, chlorine is utilized for water disinfection and digester gas\n(which contains methane) is generated in the anaerobic digesters (anaerobic digesters are\noperated in the absence of oxygen). Provided below, is a brief description of the primary\noperations conducted at the facility and a description of the storage, handling and use of chlorine\nand digester gas.\n\nPRIMARY OPERATIONS\n\nFigure ES-I provides a simplified process flow diagram for the wastewater treatment process at\nRP-2. As shown, raw sewage is passed through screening and grit removal units, primary\nclarifiers, aeration basins, secondary clarifiers, chemical addition, tertiary filters, chlorination and\ndechlorination units and then discharged. The plant effluent is discharged to Chino Creek and\nonto the Santa Ana River.\n\nRP-2 contains nine aeration basins, two anaerobic digesters, four primary clarifiers, four\nsecondary clarifiers, and a maximum of twelve one ton containers of chlorine.\n\nSTORAGE, HANDLING AND USE OF CHLORINE\nRP-2 Chlorination Process Description\n\nAt RP-2, the quality of water is monitored via sampling of the process. Chlorine is periodically\nutilized (on an as-needed basis depending upon the results of the water sampling) to control the\ngrowth of organisms in the activated sludge process and to control sludge settling in the gravity\nthickener, and to reduce/control odor in the plant influent flow. In addition, chlorine is utilized to\ndisinfect cleaned/treated water prior to discharging (this is also known as final disinfection of the\neffluent). Chlorine is a regulated substance subject to the federal RMP requirements.

The evaporator provides the heat necessary to vaporize chlorine (the evaporator is a\nheat exchanger which circulates hot water through a jacket around the chlorine evaporation\nchamber). The chlorine gas generated by the evaporator is transferred to the chlorinator under a\nvacuum and injected into water (now referred to as chlorine solution). The vacuum from the\nevaporator to the injection point is maintained by the ejectors. As a result of having chlorine\ninjected into it, the water contains elevated levels of diluted chlorine. This chlorine solution is\nthen transferred via underground piping to the five end use points where it is mixed with the\nwater to be treated. Two of these end use points are for continuous disinfection of cleaned/treated\nwater prior to discharging. The remaining three points are utilized periodically to control the\ngrowth of organisms in the activated sludge process and to control sludge settling in the gravity\nthickener, and to reduce/control odor in the plant influent flow.\n\nSTORAGE, HANDLING AND USE OF METHANE\nRP-2 Anaerobic Digestion and Digester Gas Production Process Description\n\nSolids removed from the liquid treatment processes are thickened and stabilized in anaerobic\ndigesters. Anaerobic digestion is accomplished by retaining the sludge in the absence of oxygen\nwithin the large, airtight digestion tanks for a period of 25 to 30 days. Within these tanks,\nmicroorganisms digest the sludge and convert the solids into cells and continuously produces\ngaseous byproducts.

It was further assumed that the material was released directly\noutdoors (i.e., outside of the energy recovery building). Utilizing this assumption is much more\nconservative in nature and resulted in the estimation of the largest vulnerable zone for these types\nof accident scenarios. Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable\nzone for these types of scenarios is approximately less than 0.1 miles.\n\nFigure ES-3 presents a graphical representation of the vulnerable zones for the worst-case release\nscenario and the alternative release scenario for accidental releases involving methane. Also\npresented in Figure ES-3 are the sensitive receptors located within one-mile of the facility. Table\nES-I lists sensitive receptors in close proximity to the facility.\n\nES 3.0 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, the facility has NOT had any releases\nof regulated substances which have resulted in:\n\nOnsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\n\n  Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or\nsheltering in place.\n\nES 4.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC\nPREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at the Agency consists of a series of programs,\nprocedures and policies designed to minimize the risk of accidental releases involving regulated\nsubstances handled at the facility (i.e., the only regulated substances handled at the facility are\nchlorine and methane contained in digester gas).

Details of each of these components of the Agency's Accidental\nRelease Prevention Program are provided in the document entitled Risk Management Plan\n(RMP), Volume I - Prevention Program.\n\nThere are several chlorine and methane leak detection and monitoring devices and other\nprotective devices (e.g.., for fire and explosion) placed at strategic locations throughout the\nfacility. Table ES-2 provides a summary listing of these detection and monitoring devices as well\nas their sensitivities.\n\nES 5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe Agency recognizes that emergency planning and emergency response are an integral\ncomponent of risk management. As such, the Agency currently has emergency action plans and\nemergency evacuation plans in place. In addition, the Agency has developed a Fire Prevention\nPlan. These programs work together to mitigate the effects of unplanned releases or events.\nHowever, as a measure to improve safety, the Agency is currently developing a specific response\nprogram for emergencies involving chlorine and methane.\n\nThe Agency is planning to conduct a joint emergency response drill with the San Bernardino\nCounty Interagency Hazardous Materials Response Team. This will ensure that key agencies\nwhich could be involved in emergency response at the Agency are familiar with the facility\noperations and hazards and are also familiar with the capabilities of Agency pe"

In addition, these drills will ensure that the existing emergency\nresponse plan is evaluated during the drilling process for its functionality, practicality and\neffectiveness. Based on these drills changes and modifications may be made (as appropriate) to\nimprove response efficiencies.\n\nES 6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA detailed hazard and operability study (i.e., hazards analysis) was performed on ALL operations\ninvolving chlorine and digester gas (i.e., methane) in order to evaluate the potential for accidental\nreleases. As a result of this hazards analysis a number of recommendations were made to\nimprove the safety of the operations conducted. The recommended actions are summarized in\nTable ES-3. Table ES-3 also presents the implementation status of the recommended actions. As\nshown, the Agency has already implemented a number of the recommendations. Table ES-3 also presents the expected date of implementation for those recommendations not yet implemented.\n\nES 7.0 FOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nThe Agency recognizes that some persons may be interested in obtaining more detailed\ninformation regarding risk management prevention program components not discussed herein.\nInterested parties that have additional questions regarding the Agency's Risk Management Plan,\nare directed to contact:\n\nMr. Sean R Denman\nInland Empire Utilities Agency\n9400 Cherry Avenue, Building A\nFontana, California 92335"
