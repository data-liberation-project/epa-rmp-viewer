We have conducted tours and discussed our contengency plan, and theirs, with human safety and damage minimization in mind.\n\nThe majority of our business is the sale and distribution of industrial aerosol adhesives, lubricants and cleaners.  We warehouse large enough quantities of these aerosols to exceed the threshold for EPA's RMP for two chemicals; isobutane and propane.  These flammable gasses act as propellants to expell the products from the aerosol cans.  The average aerosol can contains less than 130 grams of propellant.  The aerosols we warehouse are 16, 20 and 24 fluid ounce steel cans packaged 12 per fibreboard box.  \n\nWe also have one or two 30 pound (gas grill size) cylinders of propane and isobutane on hand which we use to fill sample aersol cans.  The release of one of these cylinders would constitute our worst case release.  It would create a flammable atmosphere in our building but would not pose any chance of offsite impact.  The actual endpoint value would be .002 miles which is less that RMP submit will accept.  If released during working hours the vapors would dissipate from our building quickly because we exhaust 4000 to 8000 cfm during working hours with explosion proof fans.  \n\nWe have a very good safety record and attribute it to the emphasis we place on safety training, which begins with top management commitment.  We conduct monthly, or more frequent if necessary, safety meetings on various subjects relating to safety.  Several sessions relate directly to preventing or controling releases.  They are \"Handling Flammable Liquids\", \"Properties of Compressed Gasses\", \"Spill Response Training\", and hands"

      "SummaryText": " on \"Fire Extinguisher Training\". \n\nOur company has been in business at this location for over 50 years and has never had a release of propane or isobutane with offsite consequences.  The likelihood that we will ever have one is remote due to the small amount of gas in each container we warehouse.\n\nOur company has a contingency plan to cover chemical or fire emergencies.  We have designated emergency coordinators who have contingency plan manuals and are very familiar with our facility.  We have an evacuation plan posted by each entrance and have drills twice each year.  As mentioned earlier, we have been proactive in working with local authorities to plan for emergency response.\n\nWe plan to continue our commitment to safety for the sake of our employees, our company, and our community.  We will continue to improve our safety program as we identify areas where it is possible to do so."
