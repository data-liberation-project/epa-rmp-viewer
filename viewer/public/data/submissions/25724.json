FACILITY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\n\nThe management and employees of Tama Benton Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility Is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nOur facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.  The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.  The system consists of 2 tanks (26,000 and 30,000 gallons) and 25, 1000 gallon nurse tanks along with associated piping, valves, liquid pumps and other miscellaneous equipment.  The Anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall).  The maximum amount stored is 68,850 gallons (354,300 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity 0f 85%.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the largest anhydrous ammonia storage tank (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.40 miles.  The estimated population within a 4.4 mile radius of this facility is 1,250.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia transfer hose.  The scenario involves the release of 2,900 pounds of ammonia and with neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.30 miles.  The estimated population within a 0.30 miles is 400.\n\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVE"

      "SummaryText": "NTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 aand State law.\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.  Finally, Tama Benton Cooperative has extended to the Dysart Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nTama Benton Cooperative, Dysart, Iowa has not experienced any accidental release involving anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Tama Benton Cooperative to immediatly notify the Dysart Volunteer Fire Department and the Tama County, Iowa LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency.  In the unlikely event that the Dysart Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Dysart location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Dysart has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Tama County LEPC.  Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant.  In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFTY:\n\nThere are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
