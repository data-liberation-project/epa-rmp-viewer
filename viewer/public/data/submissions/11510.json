Founded in 1924, VW&R supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by VW&R are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  Van Waters & Rogers Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to VW&R facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).  VW&R responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders "

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Repackaging, Storage & Distribution.  We have four regulated substances present at our facility.  The substances are Formaldehyde 37% Solution, Ammonia Aqueous 30%, Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 52%, and Hydrochloric Acid 40%.\n \nListed below are the way the four RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventories present at any one time.\n\n1. Formaldehyde 37% is received in 55 gal drums and stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Formaldehyde onsite at anyone time will be 30,000 lbs.\n\n2. Ammonia Aqueous 30% is received in 55 gallon drums and 330 gallon intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) and stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Ammonia Aqueous 30% onsite at any one time will be 30,000 lbs.\n\n3. Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 52% Aqueous is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Hydrofluoric Acid onsite at any one time will be 40,000 lbs.\n\n4.

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What-If\" technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Van Waters & Rogers Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nVan Waters & Rogers I"
