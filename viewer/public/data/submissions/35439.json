Rhodia's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nb. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared to address the handling of the sulfur dioxide at the Rhodia Dominguez Plant.\n\nc. Sulfur dioxide is present in solution in spent acid received by the facility. It is also present as a gas within the Plant 4 sulfuric acid regeneration plant and dissolved in weak acid in the Plant 4 sulfuric acid regeneration plant.\n\nd. Rhodia has a comprehensive release prevention program meeting RMP Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Physical safeguards to prevent a release of a regulated substance include best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation, monitoring, alarm and shutdown systems. Procedural and other safeguards are also used.\n\ne. There have been no accidents at this facility which meet the criteria for inclusion in the Five-year Accident History Component of the Risk Management Plan.\n\nf. Rhodia has a comprehensive emergency response program in place to provide prompt but safe response to halt and/or mitigate a release. Rhodia's Emergency Response Team is well trained and well equipped to handle a wide range of emergencies. Rhodia has worked closely with Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACFD) in developing its response plan. \n\ng. Rhodia has undertaken numerous changes to improve safety at the Dominguez Plant. The most recent is the discontinuation of oleum operations. Changes to improve safety which are planned but not yet implemented are:-\n\n- Fire protection improvements in the heavy spent acid storage area.\n- Reevaluation of the Plant 4 emergency shutdown s"
