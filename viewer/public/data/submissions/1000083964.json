      "SummaryText": "Introduction 2019 5 year revalidation\n\nThe Risk Management Program at PR Farms Ranch 20 Cold Storage in Madera California complies with US EPA, OSHA and Cal ARP requirements. PR Farms, Inc. Madera Ranch 20 operates a seasonal cold storage and packing facility South of Madera California.  The facility is located just East of highway 99 in a rural farming area. Primary activities include pre-cooling, packing and cold storage of fruit, olives and vegetables. The most recent changes were the addition of a plate and frame glycol chiller to provide olive processing area cooling to a seperate and detached processing room. Existing capacity and ammonia inventory is fine.\n\n\n\nThe facility was originally constructed in the late 1970's with retrofits in 1991, 1998, 2001 and 2014. The facility is operated by trained on-site operators with major maintenance by a qualified ammonia refrigeration contractor. \n\n\n\nThe procedures used for complying with the RM Program regulations are outlined by the following major steps:\n\n1.    Identify Covered Processes\n\n2.    Determine Program Level\n\n3.    Establish a Management System\n\n4.    Conduct a 5-year Accident History\n\n5.    Perform Hazard Assessments\n\n6.    Develop an Accident Prevention Program\n\n7.    Develop an Emergency Response Program and\n\n8.    Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\n\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at PR Farms Madera Ranch 20 Cold Storage are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training demonstrates this commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regula"

This activity is consistent with SIC 0723/ NAICS 115114 post harvest crop activities. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is more than 10,000 lbs. and used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system. Under planned operation and PM there should only be minor incidental or operational loss of refrigerant. Sulfur Dioxide is used for fumigation however inventories are below levels necessary for including.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \"dialogue\". According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  This included worst case and alternate case releases. Details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rulemaking since this information is public and might be used by a terrorist.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordanc"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What if /Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, PR Farms Madera Ranch 20 Cold Storage maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. They also include Confined Space, Oil Draining, LOTO/Line-Breaking, Ammonia loading and Emergency Pressure release operation. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nPR Farms Madera Ranch 20 Cold Storage has a training documentation program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Our initial training consisted of several days of specific training on-site. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.

Most recently SRV's were replaced and compressor maintenance and rebuilds performed. Process equipment examined by regular checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel or Refrigeration Contractors with a strong background in maintenance practices.  Specialized training is provided to these personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at PR Farms Madera Ranch 20 Cold Storage to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes. The most recent addition of a plate and frame glycol chiller went through a MOC process.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes will be a regular practice at PR Farms Madera Ranch 20 Cold Storage.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nPR Farms Madera Ranch 20 Cold Storage will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. Any incidents that release a reportable amount of Ammonia require updating the 5 year Accident History and filing a revised RMP with the EPA.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nPR Farms Madera Ranch 20 Cold Storage truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
