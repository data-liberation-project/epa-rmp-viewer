THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Assn. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     -The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for the sale to farmers.\n\n     -Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored , and distributed for both direct application for crop nutrients.\n\n     -The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 135,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n     a. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10.4 minutes for anhydrous ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 135,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to end point dispersion to 200ppm is 1.16 miles.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario for ammonia is a 2 minute release from a 3 inch pipe break resulting in a distance of .78 miles.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration - OSHA-, 29CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". In addition, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Ammonia Rules.\n\n5.  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n     There have been"

A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29CFR 1910.38;\n\n     b. Provided State and Local Authoritites the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title lll - EPCRA.\n\n     c. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
