Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nN. Specialized Safety Features\n\nSite specific detection and control equipment (safety features) are deployed throughout the plant to:\n\n1. Contain/control a release\n2. Quickly detect a release, and\n3. Reduce the consequences of an RMP-regulated substance release\n\nThe following type of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n2. Automatic and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\n3. Automatic plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and automatically operate all automatic valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare. \n4. Curing or diking to contain liquids releases\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n6. Atmospheric relief devices \n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire extinguishers only\n2. Trained emergency response personnel\n3. Personal protective equipment\n\nO. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Hainesville Gas Processing Plant has had no RMP-regulated substance release during the past five years. \n\nP. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.

Changes are reviewed to: \n\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n\nK. Incident Investigation\n\nMontare will promptly investigate all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation will be to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team will document its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences, and forward these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented and investigation reports will be retained for at least 5 years. \n\nL. Compliance Audits\n\nAt least every 3 years a Compliance Audit addressing OSHA, EPA, RMP and Good Engineering Practices is conducted by employees and management of Montare.

Correcting identified deficiencies\n5. Applying quality assurance measures\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on: \n\n1. Overview of the process\n2. Safety and Health hazards\n3. Applicable maintenance procedures\n4. Emergency response plan\n5. Applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nWritten procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner and serve as a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate safety concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. A management of change team will review the use of equipment and determine what action is necessary.\n\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Montare incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps to determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and thee proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nI.
