              "Description": "As a part of the implementation of the Risk Management Plan, or PSM/RMP Plan, a prevention program has been developed to manage process safety associated with the ammonia process. Each of the program elements has been developed in accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP, OSHA PSM, and CalARP regulations to ensure safe operating practices and conditions at the facility. These core program elements are:\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Employee Training\n\n?    Contractor Safety\n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Hot Work Permits\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n?    Emergency Planning and Response\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations at the time of design of the facility design and construction (2018). In addition to California Building, Fire & Mechanical Codes (2016), Preferred Freezer Services has adopted original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommended practices and the guidelines of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) as recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP). Specifically, IIAR 2-2014, Standard for Safe Design of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems, IIAR Bulletin No. 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System, and IIAR Bulletin No. 110, Guidelines for Start-up, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems address mechanical integrity inspections. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15-2013, Safety Standard for Refrigeration Systems and ASME Standard B31.5-2013, Refrigeration Piping and Heat Transfer Components have also been adopted as RAGAGEP. \n\n\n\nPreferred Freezer Services has performed an initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) on the refrigeration system design to evaluate potential hazards and consequences of deviation for the covered process. This PHA was conducted on September 6-7, 2017 at the engineering office of SubZero Constructors, the refrigeration system design firm or record. The PHA study was performed according to the procedures described in the publication Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures, Third Edition (American Institute of Chemical Engineers, 2008).  The PHA was performed by a team of subject matter experts in the refrigeration system engineering, operations and maintenance, and environmental, health, and safety. \n\n\n\nThe PHA addressed the following elements:\n\n1)    The hazards of the covered substance;\n\n2)    Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards, and their interrelationships, such as appropriate application of detection methods to provide early warning; \n\n3)    Consequences of failure of administrative and engineering controls;\n\n4)    A qualitative evaluation of the range of possible health and safety effects of failure of controls;\n\n5)    Human factors issues; and siting issues and external events.\n\n\n\nEach scenario resulting in an environmental, health, and safety consequence (e.g., accidental release) was assigned a relative risk ranking based on the severity of the consequence and anticipated likelihood of occurrence. The PHA team then discussed recommendations, which resulted in recommended corrective actions intended to improve the controls and safeguards to further mitigate risk.\n\n \n\nAmmonia safety considerations have been incorporated into the construction of the ammonia refrigeration system. The facility utilizes ammonia leak detectors within the compressor room and throughout the cold storage areas (freezers and dock) to activate alarms, emergency exhaust ventilation, and initiate system pump down and shutdown. Pressure relief vales protecting pressure vessels vent through a header to a water diffusion tank, and the facility has an ammonia detector in the pressure relief vent header to detect an overpressure release.  Further, an emergency pressure control system (EPCS) has been incorporated into the refrigeration system design.  An EPCS is a pressure-limiting safety system which activates in an over-pressure situation above the pressure limiting device set pressure, but below the relief valve set pressure to allow the portion of the system subject to over-pressure to be relieved of its pressure by moving refrigerant through a solenoid valve to a lower pressure portion of the system. The benefit of these systems is that when the EPCS activates to limit high pressure in vessels, the ammonia remains contained within the refrigeration system and is not released through the relief valves for dispersion into the atmosphere.\n\n \n\nThe Prevention Program incorporates a mechanical integrity program with regularly scheduled maintenance and visual operational inspections of equipment in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(j) and 40 CFR 68.73. The purpose is to verify that critical process equipment is designed, installed, and maintained properly, and operates correctly. In accordance with this program, the ammonia process and equipment must be constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases of the highly hazardous chemicals. The Mechanical Integrity Program at the facility includes identifying and categorizing equipment; inspecting and testing of instrumentation and documenting maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; establishing criteria for acceptable test results; documenting test and inspection results, including any corrective actions taken to address deficiencies; and documenting manufacturer information for equipment and instrumentation.\n\n \n\nThe facility performs daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual inspections of the ammonia refrigeration system and a system integrity check is scheduled every 5 years. The equipment is maintained with guidance from the manufacturer specifications, and applicable standards and codes. The facility has adopted guidance from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration for conducting these inspections.\n\n\n\nPreferred Freezer Services has implemented these various analyses and training programs to prevent and prepare for an emergency release. All new employees, regardless of position, are provided with ammonia awareness training. Special emphasis is placed on the nature of the anhydrous ammonia and actions of all personnel in case of an ammonia problem (i.e., leak). All persons hired who are responsible for operations and maintenance of the ammonia system will be given on the job training before they are allowed to work on, operate or otherwise manipulate or affect the ammonia system. The demonstration and on-the-job training includes detailed instruction on the ammonia system including the physical aspects of ammonia, operating the ammonia system, and casualties involving the ammonia system. Employees are trained regarding the hazards and safety precautions to be observed for the ammonia system. In addition, annual refresher training is required. Further, specific PSM-RMP ammonia topics are prepared by Corporate HSE for review with affected facility staff by the General Manager on a monthly basis.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has also implemented a formal Contractor Safety Program to address work on or around the covered process.\n\n\n\nThe compressor room contains a sprinkler system that would activate in the event of a fire and the compressor room ventilation system provides continuous exhaust ventilation during normal operation and additional ventilation volume under emergency operation. The compressor room is equipped with a continuous exhaust fan for normal operation, and supplemental exhaust fans that activate in the event of an ammonia release to provide a total of 30 air changes of exhaust ventilation from the compressor room.\n\n\n\nThe facility is a non-responding facility and has an Emergency Action Plan (29 CFR 1910.38), or Refrigeration Emergency Response Plan (RERP), in place with appropriate mechanisms for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response. All employees are trained in the RERP, and the RERP is reviewed annually to verify that it is current with Facility operating practice. The plan contains emergency response procedures which include actions for evaluating the severity and controlling releases of hazardous materials including ammonia. A list of the agencies that must be notified upon a reportable quantity release are included in the RERP to assure the facility meets its reporting obligations and that the public is properly notified in the event of an emergency. Further, the RERP contains a list for internal notifications, refrigeration contractor, and emergency response clean-up contractor.\n\n\n\nPreferred Freezer Services has implemented the aforementioned procedures, controls and training programs to prevent and prepare for an emergency release. \n\n",

      "SummaryText": "Preferred Freezer Services of LA7 Big Bear, LLC has created and implemented a PSM/RMP Program for their facility located at 1400 South Los Palos Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90023. The facility uses anhydrous ammonia within a closed loop refrigeration system consisting of pressure vessels, compressors, evaporative condensers, evaporators and associated piping and valves. The on-site maximum intended quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled at the facility is approximately 12,250 pounds. The facility does not use any other chemicals or flammable materials in excess of threshold quantities covered by RMP requirements. \n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM)/Risk Management Program (RMP) was developed in accordance with OSHA's PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), and California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program authorized under 19 CCR 2735-2785 because the facility handles a regulated substance (anhydrous ammonia) above the threshold quantity listed in those regulations. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, which is authorized under 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), requires that facilities that have covered processes establish a Risk Management Program to reduce the risks of accidental release of toxic or flammable materials and establish emergency response procedures in the event of an accident.\n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary summarizes the efforts that Preferred Freezer Services has undertaken to establish a RMP in conjunction with their PSM Program. A management system is implemented at the facility to oversee implementation of the facility's PSM/RMP. The goal of this management system is to ensure that lines of authority and responsibility are clearly defined to ensure that all elements of the PSM/RMP program are effectively implemented. The person who has the overall responsibility for the PSM/RMP and overall program implementation at the facility is "
