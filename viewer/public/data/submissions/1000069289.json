      "SummaryText": "Preferred Freezer Services of LA7 Big Bear, LLC has created and implemented a PSM/RMP Program for their facility located at 1400 South Los Palos Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90023. The facility uses anhydrous ammonia within a closed loop refrigeration system consisting of pressure vessels, compressors, evaporative condensers, evaporators and associated piping and valves. The on-site maximum intended quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled at the facility is approximately 12,250 pounds. The facility does not use any other chemicals or flammable materials in excess of threshold quantities covered by RMP requirements. \n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM)/Risk Management Program (RMP) was developed in accordance with OSHA's PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), and California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program authorized under 19 CCR 2735-2785 because the facility handles a regulated substance (anhydrous ammonia) above the threshold quantity listed in those regulations. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, which is authorized under 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), requires that facilities that have covered processes establish a Risk Management Program to reduce the risks of accidental release of toxic or flammable materials and establish emergency response procedures in the event of an accident.\n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary summarizes the efforts that Preferred Freezer Services has undertaken to establish a RMP in conjunction with their PSM Program. A management system is implemented at the facility to oversee implementation of the facility's PSM/RMP. The goal of this management system is to ensure that lines of authority and responsibility are clearly defined to ensure that all elements of the PSM/RMP program are effectively implemented. The person who has the overall responsibility for the PSM/RMP and overall program implementation at the facility is "

      "SummaryText": "the General Manager.\n\n\n\nAs a part of the implementation of the PSM/RMP a prevention program has been developed to manage process safety associated with the ammonia process. Each of the program elements has been developed in accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP, OSHA PSM, and CalARP regulations to ensure safe operating practices and conditions at the facility. These core program elements are:\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Employee Training\n\n?    Contractor Safety\n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Hot Work Permits\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n?    Emergency Planning and Response\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n?    EPA RMP and CalARP Submittals\n\n\n\nThese elements are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by Preferred Freezer Services through this management system. In addition to third-party triennial compliance audits, the management system includes an annual site visit and review of the PSM/RMP program implementation by Preferred Freezer Services' Corporate Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) department.\n\n\n\nThis RMP will be updated every five years and the first update is due in April 2023.  This RMP will also be updated within six months in the event of a change that requires a new process hazard analysis or if the program level is altered due to a change in the process, as required by the RMP and CalARP regulations. To date, the facility has not had any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. No further changes to the refrigeration system design are planned at this time.\n\n"
