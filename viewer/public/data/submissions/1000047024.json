      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nBronco Wine Company is a family owned / operated business that produces a variety of wines. Bronco Wine Company has prided itself in ensuring a safe operation dating back to startup of the company in 1974.\n\n\n\nThe Bronco Wine Company is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. The Safety Manager administers the company's safety and environmental policies. The Safety Manager is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the all safety and environmental programs. These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, confined space entry, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nBronco Wine Company has an emergency response plan in effect. The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.)     To save lives.\n\n2.)     To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.)     To protect the environment.\n\n4.)     To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Bronco Wine Company is located at 6342 Bystrum Avenue, in Ceres, California. The facility is situated on 80 acres in a rural area located off of Keyes Road which is approximately 5 miles west of Highway 99. The majority of the ammonia equipment is located outside throughout the facility.  The one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide are located outside in the crush area; however, the smaller cylinders are used throughout the plant. The facility was originally built in 1974.\n\n\n\nAmmonia:\n\n\n\nThe low side of the refrigeration system typically uses one or more evaporators to remove heat from the space or products to"

      "SummaryText": " be cooled. The facility uses two types of evalporators. The evaporators used for warehouse cooling contain a set of continuous coils through which the refrigerant flows. Due to the low pressures and corresponding low temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant quickly evaporates, absorbing a great deal of heat from the surrounding area. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia.  The other type is a shell and tube heat exchanger.  These are used to cool grape juice or wine.\n\n\n\nThe low and high sides of the refrigeration system are separated by the compressor and the expansion valve.  The compressor is the driving force of the system. It pulls refrigerant vapor from the evaporator (low side) at a rate that will maintain the evaporator pressure required for the desired operating temperature. At the same time it pressurizes the warm vapor and forces it into the condenser and the high side of the system.  The refrigeration compressors in use are screw type and reciprocating.\n\n\n\nExpansion valves regulate the flow of liquid refrigerant from the high side to the low side by causing a large pressure drop. These valves are located between the receiver (high side) and the evaporator (low side). This valve, coupled with the capacities of the compressor, can help regulate the pressure of the evaporator thereby creating the cooling capabilities of the system. The high side of the refrigeration system consists of a condenser and a receiver. Warm refrigerant vapor enters the condenser after it has been pressurized by the compressor. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from this vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low sid"

It also serves to hold the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating.\n\n\n\nThe Bronco Wine Company ammonia systems are utilized in two processes that are connected and colocated: Champagne and Main. Bronco Wine Company's two ammonia refrigeration systems are closed systems that cycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 27 psig on the low pressure side of each system to 200 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is of 250,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide:\n\n \n\nSulfur dioxide is used in the crush process. Sulfur dioxide from a one-ton container is pushed, using house nitrogen at approximately 80 psi, through a flexible line to a mass flow meterand metering pump. The metering pump feeds a specific amount of SO2 into the crushed grapes (must). At this point, the flow is dependent on the demand at the crusher. When the pump at the crusher is turned on, the solenoid valve opens allowing the flow of sulfur dioxide into the crusher unit.\n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of sulfur dioxide is six one ton containers or 24,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance w"

In addition, pressure relief valves automatically engage in the event of overpressurization.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration systems are equipped with various status indicators to monitor system parameters and to minimize the potential for ammonia-related accidents. The monitoring systems consist of 1) indicators (pressure, temperature, and level), 2) alarms (pressure, temperature, and level), and 3) routine inspections.  Pressure/temperature indicators are located throughout the system. Level indicators, such as a sight glass, are located on vessels maintaining a liquid level (e.g. high pressure receiver and the pump package vessel).  System alarms are activated at the control panel.\n\n\n\nIn addition, operations are monitored through routine system inspections conducted by qualified operators and mechanics. Operators are always on-site during times of system operation.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBased on a review of the Hazard Assessment Update (October 2014), the five year accident history (May 2009 through October 2014) revealed that there was one minor incident involving sulfur dioxide; however, there were no injuries or off site property damage associated with this scenario. There was also one incident involving ammonia that was below the federal reportable quantity. Neither incident meets the criteria for EPA reporting in the RMP.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility.\n\n\n\n1.
