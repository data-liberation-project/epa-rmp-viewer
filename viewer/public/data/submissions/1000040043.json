All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency (EPA) prevention program are adhered to.  Mia Products emergency response policy involves the preparation of an emergency response plan and the emergency response services in the community. Mia Products is in compliance with all OSHA and EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\r\n\r\nB.\tMia Product is a producer of novelty ice products.  On site we have 32,000 lbs. Anhydrous Ammonia.  Mia Products uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigeration to cool products and chill liquids.  The plant is normally manned around the clock, the only exception would be holidays.  On holidays the plant is monitored by an in-house alarm system that is monitored by EST security.\r\n\r\nC.\tThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as A worst case release and alternative scenario.  First scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecific failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  \r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario at Mia Products involves a failure of the receiver, which is has capacity of 10,352 pounds at 80% volume of vessel.  The offsite consequence analysis for the scenario was performed for the two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, using of the one hour average 200 PPM as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within the full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distant.  EPA set these conditions to facility the performance of the offsi"

The amount of release anhydrous ammonia released is 44 lbs./min. at the average rate over one hour (the duration of the release) of 2640 pounds.  Toxic endpoint distance to ERPG-2 and 3 levels were obtained.  The latter is defined as IDLH as A\u00bfthe maximum airborne concentration below which that individuals could be exposed for up to without experience or developing life threat ting health effects.  The typical meteorological conditions used were Stability D, Wind Speed 3m/sec, Average Temperature 70 degrees F., and 50% average humidity.  The estimated distance traveled to the toxic endpoint is .085 miles.  The estimated of residence population affected is 250.\r\n\r\nD.\tMia Products accident release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\na.\tHigh level of training of the operators and maintenance personnel.\r\nb.\tPreventive maintenance program.\r\nc.\tUse of state-of-art- process and safety equipment.\r\nd.\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of the operators.\r\ne.\tPerformance of a hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\r\nf.\tImplementation of an audit and inspection program.\r\n\r\nPreventive steps include availability of Full Face Cartridges Mask, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), Class A Suits, Class B Suits, MSA DragonFly alarms, Motorola communication devices (two way earpieces), hand held ammonia detectors, fixed ammonia detectors, and training (Technician Level/Incident Commander).
