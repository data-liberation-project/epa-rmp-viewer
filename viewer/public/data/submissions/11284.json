(AGA) facility located in Brook Park, Ohio complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane storage/handling system, it is our policy to immediately notify the Brook Park Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe AGA facility stores propane in one 30,000-gallon above ground storage tank (AST).  Propane is put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.   The propane storage/handling process consists of one 30,000-gallon propane AST, propane cylinder filling equipment, filled propane cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the AGA facility considers the potential failure of one 30,000-gallon storage tank filled to 80% of it's holding capacity (administrative controls limit each storage tank to 80% of capacity at 600F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Utilizing a computer-based version (RMP*Comp) of the methodology presented in USEPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, USEPA, May 24, 1996, the distance to the flammable endpoint (1 psi overpressure) was determined to be 0.4 miles.  The public receptors affected under this worst-case release scenario include commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities and residential property.  The residential population within this 0.4-mile radius is approximately 735 persons, which was estimated using an Environmental Data Resources - Offsite Receptor Report.\n\n4.

The release rate of propane from the cylinder was estimated to be 1.67 pounds per minute.  It was assumed that the release occurred for a duration of 60 minutes.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario modeled a release of a total of 100 pounds of propane.  Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the flammable endpoint was determined to be 0.02 miles.  The only affected public receptor under this alternative release scenario is a commercial facility.  There is no residential population within this 0.02-mile radius.\n\n5.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe AGA facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law at the AGA facility in Brook Park, Ohio.\n\n6.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThe AGA facility has never had an accident involving its propane storage/handling process.  \n\n7.  The emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our propane storage system, it is AGA's policy to immediately notify the Brook Park Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  We have communicated this policy with the Brook Park Fire Department.  All employees have access to AGA's emergency action plan, and emergency action training is conducted annually.  \n\n8.
