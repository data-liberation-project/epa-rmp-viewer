Wherever possible refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic). The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel.\n\n2.0 Rich-SeaPak and Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nRich-SeaPak processes and cools appetizer products for national distribution. Approximately 47,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at Rich-SeaPak. A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia from the system. \n\n3.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps.\n\nRich-SeaPak complies with all rules and regulations that pertain to the safe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia. Specific regulations include: OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule; OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER); OSHA Hazard Communication (HAZCOM); OSHA Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans; EPA Risk Management Plans (RMP). \n\nSpecific prevention steps that have been implemented to increase the safety of operation of the ammonia refrigeration system include: microprocessors have been installed on all compressors to improve control and safety during a malfunction; ammonia system alarms are linked to the refrigeration office computer for improved monitoring; an engineering review analysis and audit was completed for the ammonia refrigeration system by The Stellar Group on May 12, 2004.
