If an accidental release were to occur, GATC has response measures in place to minimize the release impact.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS \n\nThe worst-case release scenario incorporated the following:\n\n7 At the time of this writing, GATC used the latest available version of USEPA's RMP*Comp software to estimate distances to the toxic and flammable (1 psi overpressure due to an explosion) endpoints for the 59 substances listed above. \n\n7 For the worst-case release, GATC analyzed 59 regulated substances.  This release consisted of the largest quantity of a given substance released from the largest class of railcar that could potentially carry a given substance.  For example, in cases where several different size railcars could transport a given substance, the release was assumed to occur from the largest single railcar that could transport that substance.  Passive mitigation measures were not included in the worst-case analysis since passive mitigation measures are not utilized at the Hearne facility.\n\nThe RMP*SUBMIT program presents one worst-case toxic release and one worst-case flammable release.  The toxic substance presented in RMP*SUBMIT is anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.  USEPA's RMP*Comp model was used to determine the distance to the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/L.  The flammable substance presented in RMP*SUBMIT is pentane.  USEPA's RMP*Comp model was used to determine the distance to the pentane flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  The toxic and flammable endpoints do go offsite.  These substances were presented in RMP*SUBMIT since the distance to their respective toxic and flammable endpoints is greatest.\n\nRail cars are inspected by GATC personnel for potential leaks and the rail car's  structural and operational integrity are assessed before the cleaning process begins.

No mitigation measures are in place.\n\nChlorine Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe chlorine release is a 15-minute duration release, from a ruptured hose during railcar unloading.  No mitigation measures are in place.\n\nNitric Acid Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe nitric acid release is a hose rupture during railcar unloading, thereby forming a pool.  The hose is connected to a valve on the bottom of the railcar.  The nitric acid pool evaporates into the atmosphere.  The hose rupture diameter is assumed to be 2-inches.
