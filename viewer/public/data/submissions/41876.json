The program includes a hazard assessment that evaluates both a worst-case scenario and an alternative scenario, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. This document serves a vital community right to know function by informing the public of potential risks associated with the releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and described the City?s efforts to minimize such risks.\n\nREGULATORY BACKGROUND\nSection 112(r) of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act required certain facilities to take steps to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued ?Chemical Accident Prevention Provision,? rules (contained in 40 CFR Part 68) to implement the 112(r) requirements. Under this rule, all covered facilities must implement a risk management program and file a risk management plan with the EPA by June 21, 1999. A covered facility would be one that uses, stores, manufactures, handles, or moves any of the 140 chemicals listed in 40 CFR Part 68 at quantities exceeding the threshold levels as provided in the regulations.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\nThe City of Calhoun wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is a covered facility because of the usage and storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are both regulated substances, and the respective threshold quantities are 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds under the regulations. The chlorination facilities at the Calhoun WWTP consist of eight 1-ton cylinders of chlorine (potential for a t"

Since the storage quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide both exceed threshold, Calhoun WWTP is a covered facility under the Risk Management Plan rules.\n\nThe City of Calhoun owns and operates a 16 million gallon per day (MGD) WWTP in Calhoun, Georgia. The WWTP provides sewage treatment to the local residential population and the numerous industries that are located in the City. The WWTP is a biological activated sludge treatment system with carousel aeration basins. Sludge stabilization is provided by aerobic digesters, and the City disposes of the sludge by contract land application. Effluent disposal is into the Oostanaula River. Prior to discharge, the treated effluent is disinfected using chlorine and dechlorinated using sulfur dioxide to prevent the formation of chlorinated byproducts. The RMP focuses on the chlorination and dechlorination facilities at Calhoun WWTP. Based on the quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored at the Calhoun WWTP, it is very likely that there will be off-site consequences for public receptors in the event of a worst-case release, and therefore Calhoun WWTP will not qualify as a Program 1 facility. Since Georgia is a federal OSHA state (i.e., Georgia has not been delegated OSHA responsibilities), state and local governments within Georgia are not subject to OSHA PSM standards, and therefore Calhoun WWTP will not be a Program 3 facility. Thus, Calhoun WWTP will be classified as a Program 2 facility.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nThe off-site consequence analysis consists of two components: a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nWorst-Case scenario has been defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance form a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an end point (DTE).

      "SummaryText": " DTE is the distance a toxic vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur. In the case of Calhoun WWTP, the worst-case scenario would involve the sudden release of the contents of a 1-ton cylinder of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. RMP Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (RMP guidance) was sued to estimate the DTE associated with a worst-case release. The calculations did not consider any passive mitigation systems. The guidance assumes that the contents of a 1-ton cylinder (2,000 pounds) are completely released over a 10-minute period with a corresponding release rate of 222 lb/min. The model assumes a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an atmospheric stability class F. Using this approach, it is predicted that a worst-case release of chlorine will result in a DTE of 3.0 miles, in a rural setting such as Calhoun, with an end point concentration of 0.0087 mg/L. The worst-case release DTE encompasses the entire city limits of Calhoun. A worst-case release of sulfur dioxide will result in a DTE of 3.1 miles, in a rural setting such as Calhoun, with an end point concentration of 0.0078 mg/L. The worst-case release DTE encompasses the entire city limits of Calhoun.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario for a covered process is one that is more likely to occur than a worst-case scenario. The RMP guidance suggests that the alternative release scenario should reach an endpoint off site, unless no such scenario exists. Based on an evaluation of the processes and procedures at the Calhoun WWTP, it appears that a vapor release scenario is most likely. RMP guidance was used to estimate the DTE for a vapor release from a hole of = inch in diameter. Figure 3 presents a site map of the affected area from an alternative release scenario of chlorine. Calculation sin the guidance assume a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec and an atmospheric stability class D. No active or pa"

For a vapor release hole diameter of = inch, the release rate of sulfur dioxide is estimated to be 18 lbs/min with a DTE of 0.2 miles.\n\nOff-site Human Receptors\nPublic receptors include off-site residences; institutions (e.g., schools and hospitals); industrial, commercial, and office buildings; and parks or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time without restriction by the stationary source where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure as a result of an accidental release. \n\nWorst-case Scenario (Chlorine)\nLandview software was used to estimate the population affected from a worst-case release. From the affected area maps, it is clear that the entire city of Calhoun population will be affected. Therefore, a worst-case release will impact 7,135 persons, which is the population of Calhoun according to information in Landview.\n\nPublic receptors impacted by a worst-case release are as follows:\n7 City Hall\n7 Courthouse\n7 Churches (New Zion, First Methodist, First Baptist, First Presbyterian, St. Clements, Belmont Baptist, and New Echota)\n7 Library\n7 High Schools (2), East Side Elementary School, Middle Schools (2)\n7 Water Treatment Plant\n7 Armory\n7 Gordon County Jail\n7 Calhoun/Gordon County Recreation Soccer Complex\n7 First Baptist Daycare Center\n7 Gordon County Hospital\n7 Calhoun Healthcare (Nursing Home)\n7 Gordon County Healthcare (Nursing Home)\n7 Regal Residence (Managed Care)\n7 Senior Solution (Senior Center)\n\nWorst-case Scenario (Sulfur Dioxide)\nLandview software was used to estimate the population affected from a worst-case release.

Chlorine gas connections under pressure should be periodically inspected for the following:\n\nDiscoloration of Joint: If a leak is in progress, cadmium plating provided over bronze and brass fittings will disappear and the base metal will take on a reddish color. Green copper chloride may also form around the leak area.\n\nMoisture Formation: Small droplets of water may appear on the underside of leaking chlorine joint. It is recommended that chlorine lines be painted in bright yellow so that brown rush holes will be readily visible.\n\nAmmonia can be used to detect chlorine leaks. If ammonia vapor is directed at a leak, a white cloud will form indicating the source of the leak. A plastic squeeze bottle containing liquid commercial ammonia should be kept on site. Leaks may also be detected by applying soap solution to suspected joints and observing for bubbles of escaping gas. A trade product called ?Leak-Tec? is also available for the detection of chlorine leaks and is preferred by some operations personnel.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nProgram Elements\nThe City of Calhoun has developed an emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.\n\nCoordinating Agencies\nThe emergency response plan will be coordinated annually with the City of Calhoun and Gordon County police and fire departments and the Calhoun and Gordon County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Annual coordination may include facility tours, chlorine safety training, and chlorine response drills. The local coordinating agencies have been provided with a copy of the report, and agreements have been reached with local emergency response agencies.\n\nResponse Procedures\nResponse Procedures are dictated by the magnitude of the release.

In no event must the employee act in a manner that will endanger his or her safety.  If the leak appears serious enough that one person cannot control the situation, the employee must not act alone.  The employee must summon help and in the meantime gather the tools/equipment needed to control the leak.  After the plant operator or emergency coordinator arrives on the scene, the employees must jointly attempt to control the leak. Control of leak is the first priority for the employees.  Regulatory agencies may not be notified in the event of a small leak.

If the employee is trained in the control of gas leaks he or she must wear a SCBA and wait upwind of the source for the plant operator and emergency coordinator to arrive at the scene.  The plant operator must evacuate the facility of all employees except those who will participate in leak control efforts.  The plant operator must also immediately alert the local emergency response agencies that their assistance may be needed in the areas of community evacuation and medical help, if the leak gets worse.  After arriving at the scene, the plant operator and the emergency coordinator must wear SCBA units and begin leak control efforts. Control of the leak should be the first priority for the employees. Authorities at the City of Calhoun including the director of Public Works will be notified of the release. Regulatory agencies will be notified following the discussion with the Authority personnel.\n\nResponse Actions of Large Release Scenario\nResponse actions for a large release are similar to a medium-scale release.  However, in this scenario, the accident is so major (such as a ruptured cylinder) that the bulk of the response efforts are tailored toward post-release mitigation, community evacuation and medical assistance.  Community evacuation if required should be conducted with the assistance of the local police and fire departments.  Any residents living in the zone of influence should be temporarily evacuated to an area of safety until such a time that the release gets controlled and the leaking gases are dispersed.  Traffic control on roads downwind of the release will be necessary to prevent persons from entering the gas release zone.\nImmediate medical assistance should be provided to facility employees and community members requiring assistance.
