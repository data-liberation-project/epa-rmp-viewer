This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nBrief description of the stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nLyondell - Bayport Plant is located on 280 acres and is one of the world's largest PO/TBA facilities. Our facility produces many products that include propylene oxide, tertiary butyl alcohol, propylene glycols, propylene glycol ethers, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide, and ethyl tert-butyl ether.
