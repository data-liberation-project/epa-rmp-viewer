If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.To accomplish these objectives, the Risk Management Plan incorporates programs for hazard review, hazard assessment, information on the facility and equipment, operating procedures, training, maintenance, audit for compliance, and investigation of incidents involving any damage or injuries on, or off-site.  Individual programs are reviewed and revised as needed and dependent on the conclusions of any incident investigation.  Individual programs are reviewed and revised as needed and depending on the conclusions of any incident investigation.  Should the facility undergo significant change in products or services or physical plant, programs are reviewed as to their content for the changes at the facility.\n\n2.
