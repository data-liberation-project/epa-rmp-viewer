By committing to these guidelines we all contribute to our vision to be the premier diversified food company in the U.S.\n\nAmmonia safety is a key item in the plant safety program.  Nestle takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Safety & Environmental Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNestle's Franklin Park Plant produces chocolate confections for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool these confections.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Franklin Park Plant.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.
