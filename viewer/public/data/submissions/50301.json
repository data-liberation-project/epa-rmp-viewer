The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp program has a distance of .7 miles.  This facility complies with state and local codes and regulations for anhydrous ammonia storage.  Our facility is inspected annually by a State of Iowa Inspector.  This facility is an ag retail business and we store anhyfrous ammonia for retail to farmer customers.  Our storage consists of 1-18000 gallon tank and 15 small tanks with associates pumps, compressors and plumbing.  Our facility has never had an accident.  Excess flow valves on the lines are present for active mitigation in this analysis as they function to clos when maximum allowable flow conditions exist.  This favility's prevention programs are the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management Program.  These concepts include; employee participation, analysis of hazards, operation procedures and safe work practices.  Personenel training and maintenance.  In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Carson Grain to notify the Troy Mills Fire Department and the LEPC requestion assistance.
