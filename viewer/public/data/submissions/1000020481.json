      "SummaryText": "Omaha Steaks purchased this facility in May of 1998, initially, and took full possession of it in January of 2000. in 2003 an additional 35,000 sf was added to the facility including 10,000 sf of freezer. The addition became fully operational in early December of 2003. A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on September 9, 2003 before the addition went into operation. In addition, a PHA was conducted in March 2002, and prior to that a PHA study was conducted on May 20, 2000. In April of 2004, a Compliance Audit was performed at the facility, as required by the PSM standard. In 2007 a 14,000 sf  processing addition was built on the North side of the facility. In Auguts of 2008, a Compliance Audit was performed by an outside agency. The same agency conducted a PHA in January of 2008. The facility applied for VPP Star Status and during the week of February 18, 2008 OSHA conducted a week long inspections to qualify the facility for the VPP Star Status. The Management is confident, that the facility will receive the OSHA VPP Star Designation. \n\nA 4500 sf Irradiation Room was added to the building to house a future Meat Irradiator. The room is idle since it was finished. The facility received the VPP Star designation in 2008, and it is scheduled for the 3 year re-certification on May 2, 2011.\nA Compliace Audit was performed on September 2, 2010, and the suggested recommendations were implemented by January 26, 2011."
