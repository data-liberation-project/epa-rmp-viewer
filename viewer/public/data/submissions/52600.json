This commitment is\ndemonstrated by significant investments of resources to prevent releases of hazardous substances and for accident prevention, such as employee participation and training, and considering safety in the design,\ninstallation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  Valvoline policy is to implement practical controls to\nprevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  However, if a releases does occur, the Hernando Plant has a well-defined emergency action plan and controls to contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Valvoline Pyroil Plant, located in Hernando, Mississippi, produces a variety of car-care products.  The\nfacility consists of an outdoor tank farm and administrative and manufacturing buildings where the finished\nproducts are processed and packaged .  These products are well known under the Pyroil brand name and the manufacturing facility is ISO 9002 certified.  The plant has an excellent safety and environmental record, with a high level of employee involvement and commitment to operational excellence.  \n\nThe Pyroil plant has one manufacturing process (starting fluid manufacturing process) that uses a flammable substance - ethyl ether - listed in the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  There are no toxic or reactive regulated substances involved at the site.  The starting fluid manufacturing process involving ethyl ether consists of storage, blending and packaging.  The process operations are covered by OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard and are considered Program Level 3 for the RMP rule.  \n\nA product distribution center, located on adjoining property (separated by railroad tracks), warehouses  the\nfinished products, containing ethyl ether.

Cans) may exceed the threshold quantity sometime during peak storage season.  The warehouse is considered eligible for Program Level 1 for the RMP rule because:\n\n     1.   There are no public receptors within a distance to an endpoint from a worst-case scenario;\n     2.   The warehouse has had no release of a regulated substance in the past five years resulting\n          in offsite exposure or consequences; and\n     3.   The warehouse emergency response activities are coordinated with the local responders. \n\nPROCESS 1.  STARTING FLUID MANUFACTURING PROCESS\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place for the starting fluid\nmanufacturing process at the Hernando, MS plant.  Because the plant process regulated by the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Pyroil plant conducts its business using a teamwork approach.  A number of business and operational\nteams provide an active forum for employee participation in the implementation of PSM standard elements. \nExamples of employee involvement range from participation in process hazard analysis  \nto recent development of operating procedures.  Employees have access to all information created as a part of the prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accidental release\nprevention program are documented in an employee participation plan in the PSM Manual.  In addition,\nspecific employee participation activities include operations teams, plant staff"

Meeting attendance sheets are\nmaintained as primary documentation. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Pyroil plant develops and updates a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperations of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits\nfor key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.   A table summarizing the reference documents and their locations is readily available along with specific procedures for maintaining current and accurate process safety information in the PSM Manual.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response exposure treatment\nconsiderations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by\ndocuments that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The Pyroil plant has established safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., level, composition) in process documentation. The Pyroil plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly-trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown).\n\nThe Pyroil plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and\nconstruction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written\nprocedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities,\nas well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis"

Within this program, each process is systematically\nexamined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Valvoline Pyroil plant primarily uses a combination of What-If, checklist and hazard and operability\n(HAZOP) analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of\npeople who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team\nidentifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accidental release prevention and mitigation\nmeasures, and the team makes suggestions for additional safeguards when the team believes such\nmeasures are needed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are evaluated by local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.\nThis ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk ranking receive prompt attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are\ncompleted. The formal resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates process hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Pyroil plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as\n(1) process  startup, (2) normal op"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a\nbasis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually\ncertified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as\nnecessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Pyroil plant has established documentation requirements for logging key process parameters. This documentation also provides guidance on how to respond to a deviation from upper or lower limits for a specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process area and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Pyroil plant maintains a\ncomprehensive training program for all employees involved in process operations. New employees receive\nbasic training in plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through skills demonstration) adequate\nknowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. Experienced operators  receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Pyroil plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or\nconstruction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with a thorough site orientation that includes (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices, prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Valvoline Pyroil plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Pyroil plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Pyroil plant conducts a PSSR for any new process/equipment or process/equipment modification that requires a change in  process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures,\npersonnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared prior to startup before placing the process/equipment into service.\nThis review provides a final check to ensure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses a checklist to verify all aspects of readiness.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) training in maintenance, testing and inspection procedures, requirements and protocals, (2) developing written procedures for maintenance, testing and inspection, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards,\n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work\npractices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure\nthat work is performed in a consistent manner and they provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests\nare performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within\nacceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will address the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Valvoline Pyroil plant\nincorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Pyroil plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.\nExamples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout\nprocedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for"

These procedures along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Pyroil plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system\nrequires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process\noperating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before\nbeing implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any\nnew hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected\nchemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures,\nare updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided\nall training necessitated by the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Pyroil plant maintains a system that requires the prompt investigation of all incidents that results in, or reasonably could result in a fire or explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of the investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team will documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to management for resolution. Corrective action taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.

The audit team is multidisciplinary and includes personnel knowledgeable in process safety and plant operations.  The team conducts the audit using protocals based on compliance requirements, company standards and industry pracitces and develops findings that are forwarded to Pyroil plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are resolved. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nPROCESS-SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe regulated process at the Valvoline Pyroil plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued\nsafe operation. The Pyroil plant has safety features to help (1) prevent occurrence of a release, (2) quickly\ndetect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following is a description of\nexisting process-specific safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated\nsubstance in the facility. These safeguards, combined with the general prevention program described in the previous sections, collectively help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nRelease Detection / Prevention\n\nEthyl ether storage tank maxim"

The normal operating pressure for all three of these ethyl ether storage tanks is 8 psig, providing a significant safety margin before challenging the pressure relief devices.\n\n    All storage tanks' vapor space is blanketed with nitrogen to eliminate oxygen within the tank.  (The nitrogen supply\n    is regulated to maintain a minimum of 1 psig blanket pressure).\n\n    Low oxygen level in the ether storage tanks reduces overall corrosion rates.\n\n    Ether with a stabilizer is purchased to minimize formation of hydrogen peroxide (and other ether\n    decomposition products).  Each shipment is received with a Certificate of Analysis for the stabilized\n    contents and hydrogen peroxide levels.\n\n    Ether contains an extremely low level of water, thus minimizing corrosion rate.   \n    \n    Periodic preventive maintenance is managed and performed using GPMate, a computerized maintenance management system. \n\n    Administrative practice is implemented to close manual valves on each tank in the event of process\n    shutdown (e.g., during weekends, or at night, when the process is shut down).\n\n    A visual inspection of the ether tank farm is carried out on a regular basis.\n\n    Containment wall protects storage tanks from external impact (e.g., from tank trailer).\n\n    Mechanical integrity inspections include daily visual inspection of piping, pumps and associated\n    systems for leaks. \n    \n    Safe work practices (e.g., hot work practice) include cessation of all traffic and construction activities\n    during ether tank trailer unloading; and\n\n    All flammable solvent storage tanks are equipped with level indication and high level alarm.\n\nRelease/Fire Containment / Control\n\n    Tank farm has a concrete floor sloped to cha"
