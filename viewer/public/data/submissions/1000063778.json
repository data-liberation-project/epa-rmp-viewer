Planned changes to improve safety; and\n\n?    Management Program\n\n\n\nII.    OSI's Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at OSI; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. OSI is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is OSI's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility's Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and vi"

Facility Identification\n\nThe OSI facility is located at 4545 South Racine Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The facility processes ready to cook and fully cooked bacon and ground beef and processes and packages chili, beans and other kettle cooked specialties. The NAICS code for the processes at the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one RMP regulated refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating meat products. \n\n\n\nAn area map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\n\n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternate scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. An audit of the PSM program was conducted in March of 2012 and the next audit take place on, or before, March 27, 2015 in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.

Employee Participation - OSI has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program ensures employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  Employees at OSI have assisted in developing the initial PHA and have assisted in revalidating the PHA every five years. In addition, employees have assisted in the development of other PSM/RMP information such as the development of operating and preventative maintenance procedures and management of change.\n\n?    Process Safety Information - OSI has developed a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed and updated as of March 27, 2012.\n\n?    Process Hazard Review - OSI has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough    to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program has been established to ensure PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and to ensure findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. The last PHA revalidation was completed on April 4, 2013.\n\n?    Operating Procedures - OSI has developed a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Annually, the operating procedures are reviewed and certified as accurate. The Standard Operating Procedures were last reviewed in Apr"

Training -OSI has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\n\n?    Management of Change - OSI has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. \n\n?    Pre-Startup Review - OSI has developed a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity - OSI has developed a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  Preventative maintenance procedures have been established within the written operating procedures. In addition, a preventative maintenance database application has been established to assist in documenting and tracking preventative maintenance activities.\n\n?    Contractor Qualifications - OSI has developed a site-specific contractor qualification procedure that ensures all contract employers' safety performance and programs are evaluated, a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained, information of potential hazards are communicated between OSI and the contract employer, and required training and information is communicated, such as the provisions of the emergency action plan and control over entrance into process areas.\n\n?
