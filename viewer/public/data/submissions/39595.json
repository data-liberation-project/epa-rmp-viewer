The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Mears Fertilizer, Inc., (MFI) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees receive regular training in, and have access to, our written Process Safety and Risk Management Plan (PSM/RMP) which includes, but is not limited to, process safety information, emergency action and operating and maintenance procedures.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Butler County HazMat Team, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at MFI is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to Cooperatives and Retail Agriculture Dealers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 132,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 156,000 pounds, however, due to changing business we rarely receive ammonia by rail.\n\n3.   The worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with our local first responders as part of an on-going training program.  More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program:  MFI has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia,\" and OSHA's PSM rule.  We have improved our training progr"

We also added emergency shutoff valves to our fixed storage vessel for added protection from an accidental release.  For added safety in handling anhydrous ammonia, we use the following on our process equipment:  \n     - three (3) external, remote air-activated emergency shutoff valves in series to control ammonia  \n       in the event a hose ruptures between the source valve and the Mix Unit; and they are\n            . inspected and tested prior to initial startup, then\n            . tested every 24 hours of operation;\n     - double-braid stainless steel metalflex tubing between the source valve and the ammonia pump;\n     - hydrostatically-tested (quarterly) stainless steel braid ammonia hose\n     - preset internal pump bypass in the event ammonia pressure exceeds operating parameters;\n     - automatic shutdown system in the event ammonia pressure exceeds predetermined operating\n       parameters;\n     - audible and visual alarms in the event a pump malfunctions during processing;\n     - walk-around inspection of all process lines and in-line equipment every 30 minutes throughout\n       operation of process equipment.\nIn addition, we hydrostatically test the hard plumbing on our Mix Units annually to ensure sound equipment.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History:  We have had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n     - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in \n       place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:  MFI has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38, and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).
