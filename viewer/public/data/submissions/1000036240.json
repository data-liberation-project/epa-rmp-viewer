The regulated substances of concern and focus of this document are anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia related or sulfur dioxide-related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter In Place plan would go into effect.  \r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the systems.  In the event that an ammonia or sulfur dioxide leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc.

Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\r\n \r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility is located at 2916 South Reed Avenue in Sanger, California, which is approximately 2 miles south of California Highway 180 and 5.6 miles east of Academy Avenue.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\r\n\r\nAmmonia Systems\r\n\r\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of wine products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed-loop system. The Main System has an ammonia charge of approximately 23,800 pounds. The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.  \r\n\r\nThe facility also uses ammonia as a neutralizing agent within a neutralization system. The Pan System uses approximately 10,600 pounds of ammonia. In the Pan System, ammonia is supplied from a 500-gallon nurse tank and injected into process water in order to increase its pH level.\r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide Systems\r\n\r\nThe facility uses sulfur dioxide to sparge the headspace of the wine tanks, which displaces air from the surface of the wine, preventing unwanted organism growth on the surface of the wine. Sulfur dioxide is also injected directly into the wine products to meet sulfur compound level specifications. The Wine Group, Inc. stores sulfur dioxide in four (4) one-ton cylinders (8,000 pounds) at two filling stations at the winery. The one-ton cylinders serve as the supply to fill smaller hand-held sulfur dioxide cylinders guns (6 pound and 100 pound gun"

The portable dispensing guns are filled at a one-ton cylinder and transported throughout the facility as needed for the wine making process.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia and sulfur dioxide above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\r\n\r\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n \r\n- Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\r\n- In depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\r\n- Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\r\n- Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\r\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\r\n- Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\r\n- A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\r\n- A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\r\n- A management of change system is in place to ensure that chang"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of the operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - Sanger, California facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.  To save lives.\r\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.  To protect the environment.\r\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia and sulfur dioxide health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n \r\nIn case of an ammonia or sulfur dioxide emergency, the operator of The Wine Group - Sanger, California facility plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).

In addition, there have been no significant releases of ammonia or sulfur dioxide that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds for ammonia, 500 pounds for sulfur dioxide).\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, conducted for the various regulated processes on site provided mitigation measures to improve safety at The Wine Group - Sanger, California facility. The Wine Group - Sanger, California facility safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\r\n\r\nDATA ELEMENTS NOTES\r\n\r\nItem numbers 7.8a, 7.10a, 7.10b, 7.11a, and 7.11b for the Pan neutralization system have been intentionally left blank.
