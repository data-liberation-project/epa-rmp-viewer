Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes at the Tujunga Wells Complex to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.\r\n\r\nThe LADWP Tujunga Wells Complex Chlorination Station (TWCS) chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the Tujunga Wells Complex Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004, June 2009, June 2014 and October 2016.

The Tujunga Wells Complex Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\r\n\r\nThe Tujunga Wells Complex Chlorination Station is located at 8801 Arleta Avenue in Sun Valley, California.  The facility is located approximately one-quarter mile east of the Hollywood Freeway (State 170) and immediately south of the Tujunga Wash River. This facility is a groundwater well field and pumping station complex. The facility injects chlorine into a collector pipeline before entering or after leaving a 3-million gallon water contact tank. The station consists of a chlorine storage room, a chlorination room, a chlorine control room, a tool room, a dry media chlorine scrubber (main scrubber), and a dry media chlorine mini-scrubber. The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and the CalARP Program rules. A maximum of twelve ton chlorine containers can be stored at the Tujunga Wells Complex Chlorination Station.  Eight of these containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas and the other four containers are stored as spares. The ton container is the largest vessel (container) online. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and the CalOSHA PSM Standard.

These eight ton containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and will close the valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room. The facility has two additional ton containers that rest on load cells. However, a maximum of only four ton containers with Halogen actuators are used for chlorination at the TWCS. All of these eight ton containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight in the containers. There are trunnions for storage of four additional full or empty ton containers without process connections. \r\nChlorine gas is withdrawn from a bank of ton containers through pigtails, which are attached to the ton container gas valves.  Chlorine flows under pressure to a chlorine header then to the automatic switchover vacuum regulating valves with check-relief unit.  The switchover valves are triggered by the rise in vacuum pressure in the chlorine feed line between the switchover valve and the chlorinator.  The rise in vacuum occurs when the chlorine container pressure approaches zero, which happens when the container is empty.  If this occurs, the switchover valve will open the alternate chlorine connection, demanding chlorine gas from the alternate chlorine containers.  Chlorine gas then leaves the switchover valve under vacuum to the chlorinators in the adjacent room.  From the chlorinators, the gaseous chlorine then travels under vacuum to three chlorine injectors in a cabinet located adjacent to an underground vault outside the station.  At the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high-pressure water supply to form a chlorine solution, which then travels to diffuser tubes located in the pipelines. It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check"

Flow signals are transmitted to the controller.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor and record the treated water residuals.\r\n\r\nMultiple chlorine leak detectors have been installed inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) Control Room at Sylmar. \r\n\r\nThe Tujunga Wells Complex Chlorination Station has a dry-media type chlorine scrubber (main-scrubber). The main-scrubber is actuated by the chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm that can neutralize up to one-ton of chlorine. The manufacturer makes performance claims of a maximum chlorine concentration of 25 ppb on the scrubber discharge under design chlorine loading rates.  The discharge stack is located on the roof of the building.\r\n\r\nA dry media chlorine mini-scrubber unit (MS) has also been installed at the Tujunga Wells Complex Chlorination Station.
