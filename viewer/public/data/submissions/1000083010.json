Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes and operations facilities.  Aka's policies and dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help prevent accidental releases.\n\n\n\nSpecific engineering design and controls along with sound administrative controls provide the first and second tiers of accident prevention Aka Energy Group, LLC facilities.  Experienced and well trained employees that operate and maintain those facilities are the third tier.  If despite our best efforts to prevent such accidents a release should occur, an Emergency Action Plan created in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38 provides a plan for safety of employees, contractors and the affected public.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe MGP, located in Lea County, New Mexico is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant which extracts hydrocarbon liquids from raw natural gas streams.  Three raw natural gas streams (Low Pressure System, Intermediate Pressure System and High-pressure System) are delivered via pipelines to the plant.  After extraction of the natural gas liquids, residue gas and the removed liquids are sold as product.  The site consists of inlet gas separation, dehydration, cryogenic gas processing, compression and product storage.  Products are transported from the plant via pipeline.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations (40 CFR 68) the MGP's inventory of chemicals is evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances are on the plant in quantities above threshold levels established by code.  (Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance shall be regulated.)  Our evaluation determined t"

(Note: condensate is exempt from threshold determination based on its National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 3.)  There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\nBased on worst case analysis of the regulated substances, the distances to endpoints (i.e. An overpressure of 1 psi) include on offsite receptor, ConocoPhillips Production Office. In addition, Maljamar Gas Plant has not had an accidental release in the last 5 years and the Emergency Action Plan has been coordinated with community response organizations.  Maljamar Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nInformation related to release scenarios made a part of this plan are removed in accordance with RMP submittal instructions.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst case accidental release scenario for the following processes is greater than the distance to the nearest public receptor (ConocoPhillips Production Office):  propane and EPBC mix.  Within the past 5 years, the processes have had no accidental releases that caused off-site impacts as defined in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent off-site impacts from accidental releases.  \n\nIn the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the processes, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact named. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT SUMMARY\n\n\n\nNo reportable, accidental releases hav"

No deaths, injuries, significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage have resulted from any activities or incidents at the Maljamar Gas Plant for the last five years.  However, a small fire occurred on February 25, 2014.  A release of gas from a one inch sensing line was caused due to a crack in a threaded connection.  The crack was determined to be caused by vibration.  The joint design was changed to prevent such a release again.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nThe overall incident response program for the Maljamar Gas Plant is coordinated with the Lovington Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the MGP personnel and the Lovington fire chief.  The MGP has around the clock communications capability with the Lovington Fire Department.  This provides a method for notifying the public in the event of an incident, if necessary as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic meetings with the Lovington Fire Department, the MGP personnel conduct emergency response drills that involve the fire department and other emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\n"
