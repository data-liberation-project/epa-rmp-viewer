A key element of its protection program is the developemnt and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.\n\nThe Henkel Corporation, Kankakee, Illinois, facility accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations industry standards, and coordiation from Kankakee County emergency response organizations.  Although the facility's programs have been highly successful - the facility has never had a significant chemical release - the facility continually seeks ways to improve its prevention and response programs.\n\nThis document, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility, was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP describes the incident at the facility which would have the most catastrohpic effects (\"the worst case\") and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (\"alternative cases\").  Although it is highly unlikely for the worse case described in the report to occur, worst case information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to the lesser magnitude scenarios which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using PHAST software.  PHAST is a very sophisticated, EPA-recognized program specifically designed for accidental chem"

      "SummaryText": "ESCRIPTION OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES-\nThe facility handles three substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule:  anhydrous ammonia, ethylenediamine and hydrogen chloride.  The RMP rules classifies these chemicals as toxic substances.  No facility chemicals are classified as flammable substances.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) within the batch cards and operating proceudres.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. Operating personnel have access to the information described above.\n\n-OPERATING PROCEDURES -\nTo ensure that personnel operate equipment in accordance with all safety precautions, the facility maintains detailed written operating procedures.  The procedures describe the safety considerations unique to specific operating modes, e.g.\n\n-     unit startup\n-     normal operations\n-     temporary operations\n-     emergency shutdown\n-     normal shutdown and\n-     initial startup of a new process\n\nThese procedures are"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change (MOC) process.\n\n-TRAINING-\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Refresher training for all operators is conducted every 3 years.  Each training program includes a method of verifying that the operator understood the training.\n\n-CONTRACTORS-\nThe facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n-     perform their work in a safe manner\n-     have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n-     are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n-     understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n-     understand and follow site safety rules and\n-     inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n\n-     a process overview\n-     information about safety and health hazards\n-     emergency response plan requirements, and\n-     safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\n\nIn addition, the facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
