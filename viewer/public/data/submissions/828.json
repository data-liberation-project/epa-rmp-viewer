THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FACILITY CONSISTS OF 1 - 18000 GALLON TANK WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 79000 POUNDS WHEN FILLED TO 85%.\n\nTHE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THIS AREA ARE TRAINED EACH YEAR ON AMMONIA SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES, AND ABOVE ALL GENERAL MAINTENANCE PRACTICES.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, OUR EMPLOYEES ALWAYS USE GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHEN FILLING NURSE TANKS.  SAFETY IS A PRIORITY AT THE JOHNSON COOP.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC RELEASE OF 79000 POUNDS WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 0.83 MILES AFFECTING 1250 RESIDENTS.\n\nTHE AMMONIA PLANT IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS THE PLANT ANNUALLY AND IS AWARE OF THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF THE FACILITY.\n\nTHE JOHNSON COOP, BECAUSE OF ITS EXCELLENT TRAINING POLICIES, IS PROUD TO REPORT THAT NO INJURY ACCIDENTS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE HAVE OCCURRED WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHIS COMPANY'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND IS SHARED WITH THE LOCAL VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH THEY HAVE AGREED TO BE OUR FIRST RESPONDER IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
