These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections to prevent these releases. The equipment is reviewed by on-site personnel, mechanical engineers and refrigeration contractors as required. On site personnel provide emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide that response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an offsite release.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly and required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years. Training and familiarity with the Company's Safety and Operating Procedures and Emergency Response Plan are required by all personnel responsible for Ammonia refrigeration maintenance and operation. They will also be required to become familiar with this RMP.\n\nThe cooling facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in their produce and cold storage operations. The Refrigeration section consists of four cold rooms with evaporators and high side refrigeration systems as a stationary source.\n\nThe worst case and alternate release scenarios were evaluated using the methodologies recommended in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as prepared by the EPA for the ammonia based refrigeration system. The worst case release considers the complete release of the maximum charge in the system for a 10-minute period (because the HPR has a large enough capacity to accommodate the entire charge, in this case 10,000 lbs, the worst case scenario assumes this amount of release over 1 10-minute period). The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 1.6 miles. For the Alternate Release scenario, the maximum extent of the release was 0.19 miles. No mitigati"

However, a diffusion tank does exist for capturing releases from PRVs, if there is such a release.\n\nA thorough review of the refrigeration system including a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) was performed on Oct 30, 2002 and followup timely reviews have been conducted, including the compliance audit on 8/6/2022 and hazard review on 6/5/2024, and further  review and PSM review on 6/5/2024. Equipment corrections and updates were discussed for those items determined to have the highest potential for offsite releases.  Safety and equipment operational training will be conducted annually and will include safety procedures and emergency response procedures.\n\nNo reportable releases or accidents relating to the release of ammonia have occurred at the facility in the last five (5) years.\n\nAll recommendations submitted at the time of completion of the previous RMP have been completed.   \n\nEquipment changes in previous years include changing to six small coils and using recirculating liquid in the dock(front room). Hazard review was done for the addition of a cold storage room having three coils (13 tons apiece) and putting in a MACS cooler (60 tons) outside the room. Hazard reviews for these projects call for using standards based refrigeration equipment, identifies changes in the emergency procedures and response plan, and recommends seismic/structural evaluation for the room and equipment attached to and/or in the room.\n\nPreviously, additional safety features for implementation were done including setting trigger of the exhaust fan in the engine room automatically upon detection of a release and installed a solenoid valve in the king valve line operated by a switch located outside the compressor room (while ensuring that the solenoid valve will not create a trapped section of liquid under high pressure or a trapped section of gaseous ammonia at pressure beyond the rated piping pressure).\n\nAlso, all valves are tagged, includi"
