Pleasant, TX 75455\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.\n\nLuminant Power's overall approach to accident prevention and risk management is as follows:\n\nLuminant Power (LP) is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  LP has implemented safety, environmental protection,and risk management programs to minimize the risks presented by hazardous materials used at its facilities.  \n\nIf there is an accidental release, LP will either provide, or request from others, immediate emergency response to minimize the effect of the release.  LP will also immediately notify the public, through local emergency management agencies, of any actions necessary to ensure public protection.\n\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\nMonticello Steam Electric Station (MOSES) is an electric generating plant using fossil fuel (coal) as an energy source.  The coal is burned in large boilers to produce steam, which is used as the motive force for the LP turbine generators.  LP takes great care in reducing emissions from burning coal to the greatest extent possible by injecting an ammonia/air mixture into the pollution control devices (electrostatic precipitators and \nbaghouses).  The ammonia reacts with sulfur dioxide present in the emission (flue gas) stream and acts to agglomerate the ash creating a larger particle size and improving performance of the pollution control devices.  \n\n\nLP uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7) at MOSES.  It is purchased as a compressed liquefied gas in bulk from commercial suppliers and fed to vaporizers where the liquid is converted to a gas and then injected into the flue gas streams.  There are two separate ammonia systems at MOSES, each with an 18,000 gallon storage tank.  Inventory is controlled to a maximum of 84,067 pounds of amm"

Under the RMP regulations, all accidental releases of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage\" within the past 5 years must be reported.  MOSES has an emergency response program that includes an emergency response plan addressing the EPA RMP-regulated ammonia system operated at the facility.  \n\nMOSES' emergency response plan contains:\n\n> Procedures for informing the local Emergency Response Agencies and the community about accidental \n   releases.\n\n> Proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental exposures to ammonia gas.\n\n> Specific procedures for emergency response to either stop the ammonia release and/or evacuate people who could be affected by the release.\n\n \nMOSES' Emergency Response Program includes the necessary emergency response equipment, personnel, and training to respond to potential releases.  MOSES has procedures for emergency equipment use, inspection, testing, and maintenance.  In addition, MOSES' emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Mt. Pleasant Fire Department.\n \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\n\nLP plans to continue the current Preventative Maintenance (PM) Program in an ongoing effort to improve safety and reduce the risk of accidental releases at MOSES.  The PM Program has proven effective in reducing potential risks identified during the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and demonstrates "
