      "SummaryText": "U. S. Steel Clairton Works\n\nEPA Risk Management Program  RMPlan Executive Summary\n\n\nThe Clairton Works of the U. S. Steel Group of USX Corporation is located in Clairton, Allegheny County Pennsylvania.  The facility is located 20 miles south of Pittsburgh on 392 acres along 3.3 miles of the west bank of the Monongahela River.  USXs Clairton Works manufactures metallurgical coke in chemical recovery ovens.  The facilitys standard industrial classification (SIC) code is 3312.\n\nCoal received from barges or the plant coal storage piles is blended, pulverized and conveyed into storage bunkers in the coke battery area of the plant.  In the coke ovens, coal is heated in 12 to 25 ton batches in the absence of air for approximately 18 hours at 2000 degrees F, yielding metallurgical coke, coke oven gases and various coal chemicals.  When the coking process is complete in an individual oven, the contents are pushed into a railroad-quenching car.  The quench car is moved to one of a number of quench towers where the coke is cooled with river water.  The coke is conveyed to screening stations where it is sized prior to being shipped. \n\nDuring the coking process, coal volatiles exit the ovens through ascension pipes and goosenecks and are collected in overhead mains running the length of each coke oven battery.  These hot gases withdrawn under vacuum are initially cooled by spraying with recirculated flushing liquors.  Most of the tar in the raw gas drops out with this initial cooling.  Condensed tar and flushing liquor flow into decanter tanks where the tar is separated from the water phase.  The excess flushing liquor, which is the result of both water and inherent moisture in the coal, is the major single source of contaminated water from the coke plant.  The recovered tar is sent to various customers to be processed into various tar products.\n\nThe partially cooled gas is then passed through direct contact primary coolers, coke oven gas compressors and final coolers.

The separation provides two clean fuel steams used for the coke oven batteries and down river fuel system.  Approximately 40 percent of the coke oven gas is used for underfiring the coke ovens and the remainder is used for steam generation and heating purposes at USXs Mon Valley Plants.\n\nA third process stream separates out light oil and acid gases.  After the light oil is removed, this portion of the coke oven gas is processed for the removal of hydrogen sulfide in a conventional carbonate absorption and vacuum stripping system.  The light oil recovered in the cryogenic system is sent to a storage area for shipment to refiners. \n\nThe contaminated process waters from the Clairton complex are collected and sent to a contaminated water treatment system for the removal of contaminates prior to discharge into Monongahela River.  This system includes settling tanks, ammonia stills and a biological treatment system.\n \nClairton Works has submitted a CAA Title V application for an operating permit, but has not received an operating permit number from Allegheny County.  \n\nThe following chemicals and their associated processes fall under the requirements of the EPAs Risk Management Program because they contain quantities greater than the thresholds:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia       Prevention Program - 3\nCoke Oven Gas               Prevention Program - 2\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is a corrosive, colorless gas with a penetrating, suffocating odor of household ammonia.

      "SummaryText": " ammonia is a colorless liquid and is transported as a liquid.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a household cleaner; fertilizer; refrigerant for cold storage and used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.\n\nCoke Oven Gas (COG) is a mixture of hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and small amounts of other gases that evolve out of coal during its destructive distillation into coke.  COG is lighter than air, flammable and toxic.  The more hazardous gases are carbon monoxide, methane, hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, and benzene.  Raw COG has an orange to brown color.  As the COG is processed, it becomes a colorless gas with a slight sulfide odor.  After processing, coke oven gas is used as a fuel on the coke batteries, boilerhouse, blast furnaces and heating purposes in the Mon Valley Plants.\n\nClairton Works developed and implemented the risk management practices associated with OSHAs Process Safety Management regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe U. S. Steel Group adopted a Statement of Policy concerning Environmental Management in October of 1991.  In the Environmental Management Policy, U. S. Steel Group emphasizes its commitment to leadership and stewardship in protecting the environment and the intent to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  The policy also seeks to reduce waste and achieve minimal adverse impact on the air, water and land through programs, which incorporate responsible environmental management. The statement stresses that environmental protection is a primary responsibility of every employee.  In May 1998, the USS Clairton Works Environmental Management System became certified to the ISO 14001 standard empathizing this commitment.\n\nThe safety program of the U. S. Steel Group, H.E.L.P.
