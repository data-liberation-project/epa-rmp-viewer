      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the tasks associated with the Sea-3 of Florida, Inc. Tampa - LPG Refrigerated Terminal Project is compliance with the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation, 40 CFR Part 68.  One of the requirements of the EPA RMP regulation is that, for processes containing one or more regulated, flammable or toxic materials, owner/operators must evaluate the effects of postulated loss-of-containment scenarios.  This involves the use of state-of-the-art computer models to simulate the hypothetical releases to determine the geographical area, which could potentially be impacted if such a release were actually to occur.\n\nExecution of the consequence modeling for the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) and the Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) along with other documentation for the Risk Management Plan was undertaken by the Process Safety and Reliability Group of Fluor Daniel, Inc.  The overall approach to this effort and the methods applied are as specified by the EPA regulation.  Where necessary, input data were supplied by the Sea-3/Fluor Daniel design team.\n\nRelease Prevention/Mitigation Policies\n\nThe construction of the Tampa LPG Refrigerated Terminal is at the grass-root level.  The policies for the prevention/mitigation of accidental releases of flammable materials in the design stage include the use of check valves, pressure relief devices, a flare system, a dike, a water spray system, a liquid impoundment system, a fire water system, tandem-seal pumps with a seal pot and other standard safety and protective equipment.  Additionally, refrigeration is provided to the LPG storage tank to reduce the extent of vaporization at the time of accidental release.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThere are two regulated flammable liquids present at the Tampa LPG Refrigerated Terminal facility:\n\n\u00b7Propane (CAS Number 74-98-6)\n\u00b7Ethyl mercaptan (CAS Number 75-08-1)\n\nThe Tampa LPG Refrigerated Terminal provides the storage for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), predominan"

The RMP rule specifies that the Threshold Quantity (TQ) of propane is 10,000 pounds.  The total mass of stored refrigerated propane in the terminal is approximately 50,000 metric tons.\n\nPrior to loading transport trucks (typically 11,500-gallon capacity), the LPG is odorized using ethyl mercaptan, which is also regulated as a flammable substance under the RMP rule.  The addition of odorant is required by federal law and is done essentially as a safety measure.  Potential leaks of LPG will be much easier to detect and mitigate than if the LPG were not odorized.  Per the RMP regulation the TQ of ethyl mercaptan is 10,000.  Approximately 14,000 lbs of ethyl mercaptan are present at the Tampa LPG Refrigerated Terminal.\n\nThere are no regulated toxic materials contained in the process.\n\nScenarios Modeled\n\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe selected Worst Case Scenario for propane at the Tampa LPG Refrigerated Terminal is a catastrophic rupture of the LPG storage tank resulting in the instantaneous release of the entire 50,000 metric tons of stored refrigerated propane with subsequent explosion of the quantity that vaporizes in the first ten minutes following release.  The resulting hazard distance, which is the distance to an overpressure of 1 psi, was calculated to be 8,918 feet (1.69 miles).\n\nThe selected Worst Case Scenario for ethyl mercaptan at the Tampa LPG Refrigerated Terminal is a rupture of one of the 10,000-gallon (7,259-lb) storage tanks of ethyl mercaptan.  The material is spilled onto undiked concrete and the amount that vaporizes in the first ten minutes participates in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting hazard distance, which is the distance to an overpressure of 1 psi, was calculated to be 536 feet.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nThe selected Alternative Release Scenario for propane is a leak through the 3.5\" diameter hole in the expansion joint in the ar"

The case was modeled as a liquid propane leak from the saturated liquid tank with head pressure of half of the maximum liquid level (49 ft).  This case was a continuous release, and several different impacts could be realized such as Vapor Dispersion, Jet Fire Radiation, Pool Fire Radiation, Flash Fire and Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The resulting maximum hazard distance was due to vapor dispersion, and the effect distance was calculated to be 780 feet.\n\nFor ethyl mercaptan, the selected ARS was a leak through \u00bd\" supply tubing located between injection pumps and metering skids.  This was also a continuous release (as opposed to instantaneous) which could result in various types of flammable impact. The resulting maximum hazard distance was due to jet fire radiation, and the distance to a radiation level of 5 kW/m2 was calculated to be 210 feet.\n\n Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Tampa LPG Refrigerated Terminal is a new facility, hence it does not have any accident history.  It should be noted that for a similar facility owned by Sea-3, Inc. in Newington, NH, there have been no reportable accidents in past 25 years of operation.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSea-3 of Florida, Inc. will complete this section at appropriate time.\n\nPlanned Changes\n\nThere are no planned changes to the facility which have resulted from this study."
