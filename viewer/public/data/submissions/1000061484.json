Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nVWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\n\n\n\nB.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nVWR International (VWR) is a distributor of high-quality chemicals and laboratory supplies.  The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in containers that meet the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations and that typically range from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume.  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  \n\n\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single covered process for regulatory purposes.  Under EPA regulations, the VWR covered process would be required to meet the Prevention Program 2 requirements because VWR is not covered by one of the NAICS codes listed as subject to the Prevention Program 3 requirements nor is it subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  However, under the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJ TCPA) regulations, all covered processes must comply with the Prevention Program 3 requirements.  Therefore, for simplicity, VWR is registering the covered process as a Prevention Program 3 program under both the EPA and New Jersey programs.\n\n\n\nAt the present time, there are four substances that could exceed a threshold quantity under the EPA and New Jersey progra"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nVWR has developed and implemented a release prevention program in accordance with the NJ TCPA regulations for the storage of the covered chemicals.  The release prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n-    Process Safety Information\n\n-    Process Hazard Analysis with Risk Assessment\n\n-    Standard Operating Procedures\n\n-    EHS Operator Training \n\n-    Mechanical Integrity/Preventive Maintenance \n\n-    Management of Change \n\n-    Pre-Startup Review \n\n-    Compliance Audit \n\n-    EHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation \n\n-    Employee Participation \n\n-    Hot Work Permit \n\n-    Contractors\n\n-    Emergency Response \n\n-    Annual Reports\n\n-    Inherently Safer Technology Review\n\n\n\nThe need for chemical specific prevention steps is very limited because chemicals are contained within sealed, DOT-approved containers, and the containers are not opened during handling.  Additionally, all chemicals are segregated and stored by hazard class to ensure that incompatible chemicals are not stored together.\n\n\n\nThe cross functional Safety Committee meets monthly to review progress on projects, close completed items and recommend changes to improve the facility.\n\n \n\nD.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents in the previous five years that have resulted in any deaths or significant property damage on-site, or any off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering from regulated substances or otherwise. \n\n\n\nE.
