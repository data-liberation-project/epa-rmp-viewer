The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\r\n\r\nB.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nVWR International (VWR) is a distributor of high-quality chemicals and laboratory supplies.  The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in containers that meet the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations and that typically range from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume.  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  \r\n\r\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single covered process for regulatory purposes.  Under EPA regulations, the VWR covered process would be required to meet the Prevention Program 2 requirements because VWR is not covered by one of the NAICS codes listed as subject to the Prevention Program 3 requirements nor is it subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  However, under the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJ TCPA) regulations, all covered processes must comply with the Prevention Program 3 requirements.
