We will properly train, equip and direct employees to perform their jobs in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\n\nWe review our performance against our objectives and targets and update the Environmental Management System as appropriate.\n\nThis policy shall be communicated to all employees and made available to the public. \n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activities at Dynea are the manufacture of formaldehyde and the production of specialty resins.  Formaldehyde is produced from the processing of methanol.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the production of proprietary resins.  The maximum quantity of formaldehyde in storage in one vessel is 49,000 gallons at a concentration of 53% by weight.  The maximum quantity of stored anhydrous ammonia is 52,000 lbs, stored in one tank.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\nThe worst case accidental release scenario would be the total release of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank over a 10-minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 lbs which represents the administrative limit imposed by the facility.  The potential distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrou"

The potential distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.05 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for formaldehyde would be the release of 22,000 lbs of formaldehyde solution at a concentration of 53% by weight formaldehyde due to tank overfilling.  The potential distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.012 mg/l) is 1.2 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAll covered processes at Dynea are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM-required accidental release prevention program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs differ, the Neste Resins' program elements have been modified to incorporate RMP issues.  An example would be that the compliance audit procedures required as part of Dynea's PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation.  Another example would be that pre-startup review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whether the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nDynea has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or formaldehyde in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor have there been any accidents which led to off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nDynea has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program.  This response plan describes the procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies of a release, provides documenta"

Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Dynea to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde and anhydrous ammonia.

Emergency response procedures are reevaluated as part of the management of change and pre-startup review requirements of the PSM and RMP programs."
