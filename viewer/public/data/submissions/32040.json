      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Univar USA Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers process design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is located at 1804 N 20th Street, Nampa, Idaho.  The primary activity at this facility is warehousing of raw chemical products.  We have 2 Regulated Substances (RSs) as defined by the federal Envioronmental Protection Agency (EPA) present at this facility.  These RSs are Hydrochloric acid (Hydrogen chloride) and Ammonia (aqueous).  All substances are warehoused for the purpose of resale.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrochloric acid (Hydrogen chloride) at our facility is 24,245.00 lbs. while Ammonia (aqueous) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 27,743.00 lbs. \n\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), \nincluding administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA?s RMP*Comp?.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA?s OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from warehousing.  In this scenario, 190 lb. of Hydrochloric Acid (conc. 37% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minu"

      "SummaryText": "tes.  The released quantity has been limited to 38% of the maximum capacity of the source.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) involves a release from warehousing.  The scenario involves the release of 56.1 lbs.  The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls, such as enclosure(s), are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.  The release is also assumed to be mitigated by neutralization.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater) is 0.06 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrochloric Acid (conc. 37% or greater) involves a release from warehousing.  The scenario involves the release of 95 lbs.  The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls, such as enclosure(s), are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.  The release is also assumed to be mitigated by neutralization.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L of Hydrochloric Acid (conc. 37% or greater is 0.06 miles.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific\nPrevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of"
