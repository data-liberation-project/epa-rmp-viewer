The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The EAP will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia system uses a maximum of 54,975 pounds of ammonia.  The system cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the air intake of a combustion turbine electrical generator.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 65 psig on the low-pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side. \n\nThe Compressors and Condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for the air intake of a combustion turbine electrical generator.  The system is located primarily in the Engine Room.  The Evaporative Condensers and Relief Valve Water Tank are located outside the Engine Room. \n\nThe process begins with high pressure liquid ammonia draining from the Condensers to the SOC Receiver.  The SOC Receiver maintains a liquid reservoir for oil cooling of the Screw Compressors (5) via a modulating control valve on the outlet to the Flash Receiver.  The control valve is connected to the liquid level in the vessel, and allows excess liquid to flow to the Flash Receiver, at which point the pressure of the liquid ammonia is partially decreased.  The ammonia vapor produced by this partial drop in pressure is drawn f"

Liquid ammonia is fed from the Flash Receiver to the Pump Receiver package.\n\nThe Pump Receiver uses five pumps to transfer the liquid ammonia to the Combustion Turbine Inlet Chilling System.  Two pumps feed each of the two Chillers, while the fifth pump is reserved for back-up purposes.  At the Chillers, liquid ammonia partially boils as it absorbs heat from the air intake of the combustion turbine.  The resultant liquid/vapor mix returns to the Pump Receiver where liquid drops to the bottom of the vessel and the Compressors pull suction from the top.\n\nThe energy input to the system is supplied by five Compressors.  Each Compressor draws main suction from the Pump Receiver and economizer suction from the Flash Receiver.  As the name suggests, the purpose for using economizer suction is to increase the efficiency of the Compressors, thereby reducing their cost of operation.  Liquid injection oil cooling is provided by the SOC Receiver, and all Compressors discharge high pressure vapor to the Condensers which are located outside the Equipment Room.  The Condensers convert the high pressure discharge to liquid by spraying water and fan-blowing air over coils filled with the ammonia vapor.  The resulting high pressure ammonia liquid drains to the SOC Receiver to begin the cycle again.\n\nAll process equipment and piping are designed according to ASME standards.  All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves which are set at 300 psig except for the five pumps, which are set at 150 psig.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Blythe Energy, LLC ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHAA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management regulation and California Accidental Rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nIt is important to note that the ammonia system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The system also incorporates a pressure relief line.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent through pressure relief valves to a common header which relieves to an outside refrigerant diffusion tank (Relief Valve Water Tank) until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized\n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the Engine Room, in the inlet to the turbine, in the relief vent line to the Relief Valve Water Tank, and in the vicinity of the chiller coils.  The ammonia leak detectors installed in the Engine Room and those located in the vicinity of the chiller coils will initiate the appropriate actions based on the following concentrations:\n\n-  25 ppm:\tActivates the local alarm in the Control Room, the emergency ventilation fan, and the exhaust treatment water pump.  Alarms are activated throughout the facility.\n-  250 ppm:  Compressors shut down.\n-  20,000 ppm:  Emergency Mode will de-energize all electrical equipment in the Engine Room (with the exception of the emergency ventilation fan and exhaust water treatment) thereby eliminating the potential for an explosion.\n\nThe ammonia detector located in the inlet to the turbine will activate the audible and visual alarm at 25 ppm to notify operators of a leak in the Chiller and shut down compressors after 30 seconds at 250 ppm.

Three switches are located outside next to each entry/exit door of the Engine Room, one in the Chiller Control Room, and one in the main Control Room.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, etc.).  Once power is restored, the anhydrous ammonia system can be restarted from the Control Room.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, in particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, A\u00c2\u00bfStartup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.A\u00c2\u00bf  The facility is manned 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Operators visually inspect the system twice a day.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the accident history of the facility revealed that there had been no reportable releases of ammonia over the past five years (July 2005 to July 2010)[12]; however, records show that a release occurred on September 25, 2004 during routine compressor maintenance.  A release of ammonia and oil occurred at 3:55 am while two employees were changing a compressor filter.  A safety tailboard was completed before the task but it did not include the risk of an ammonia release.  Proper clearance was completed on the top filter, but not the bottom.  One of the employees opened the flange on the lower filter, which was still pressurized.  A mixture of ammonia and oil sprayed one of the employees.  The employee, who was wearing the proper PPE, exited the building for the safety shower.  No injuries occurred.  Approximately 405 pounds of ammonia was"
