      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policy \n \nThe Conoco Billings Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \nDescription - Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n \nThe Conoco Billings Refinery, located at 401 South 23rd Street, Billings, Montana is owned and operated by Conoco Inc. The refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (for example, propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, and coke) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. In addition, the refinery processes hydrocarbons using Hydrofluoric Acid (HF), a regulated substance.\n\nDescription - Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARSs)\n \nToxic WCS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a toxic substances at our refinery is a catastrophic failure in the HF Alkylation process, resulting in a release of 130,000 lbs. of HF acid, released as a gas over a 10-minute period. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credits for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20 parts per million (ppm) (0.018 milligrams per liter) for this WCS is 14 miles.\n\nToxic ARS\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for HF is a 1-inch seal leak from an acid circulation pump. In this scenario, a release takes place, releasing 960 lbs. of HF acid as a gas over a 10-minute period. The 10-minute "

      "SummaryText": "release duration is the approximate time necessary to depressurize the process into our emergency dump drum and thus stop the release. No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20-ppm (0.018 milligrams per liter) for this ARS is 0.4 miles.\n\nFlammable WCS\n\nThe WCS associated with flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of 7,600,000 lbs.of butane from our largest storage tank. Administrative controls in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank are not considered; therefore, the full tank inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 1.6 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account for this release scenario.\n\nFlammable ARS\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of propane from a propane storage tank (105,000 lbs). The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 10 minutes (active mitigation). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.3 miles. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nThe Conoco Billings Refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. The frequency of all-accidental releases and injuries to our employees has decreased during this period. We investigate every incident thoroughly to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring and keep records of all incidents that occur at our facility. No incidents have occurred that have resulted in off-site impact during this time. The following is a brief summary of the one on-site accident involving the release of a regulated substance.\n\nOn March 30, 1999"

      "SummaryText": ", an employee preparing a piece of equipment for maintenance received a minor acid burn due to exposure to a trace amount of hydrofluoric acid. This exposure resulted in a reportable on-site injury.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental release prevention program in place at the Conoco Billings Refinery. All processes at the refinery regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard. This summary addresses each of the applicable OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The PSM administrative procedures used for process safety management have been revised to incorporate all RMP required items and these procedures are now considered our PSM/RMP Compliance Plan.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Conoco Billings Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management, which also includes participation in the RMP accident prevention program. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, writing operating and maintenance procedures, and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery PSM/RMP programs.\n\nSpecific ways that employees are involved in the refinery programs are documented in our employee participation plan. It addresses each accidental release prevention program element. In addition, the refinery regularly undertakes initiatives that address continuous improvement of our process safety management system and employee safety. These initiatives include having active teams that promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters such as safe operating limits (SOLs), specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific positions and groups within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Management responsibilities are outlined in our PSM administrative procedure, Process Safety Information, PSM-ADM-03, that describes our Process Technology Package (PTP) information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, are provided through material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safe operating limits (SOL s) for specific process parameters (for example, temperature, level, and composition) in our PTPs. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument safety systems (for example, automated shutdown systems). Information covering these issues can be found in our refinery PTPs and is available for all employees to access.\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and other data. This information, "

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The refinery recognized techniques to perform these evaluations. All our PHA s are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and makes recommendations for additional prevention and safety measures or design changes when the team believes such actions are necessary.\n\nLocal management reviews the PHA Team recommendations, and employees are assigned accountability to resolve all recommendation that have been made by the PHA team and accepted by local management. Implementation of recommendations in response to PHA findings is prioritized by the PHA Team. All approved recommendations being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. Upon completion of all recommendations for a specific PHA, a final report is issued that all affected employees can access. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Conoco Billings Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analys"

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. Additional information, including management responsibilities can be found in our refinery PSM administrative procedure, Management of Change, (PSM-ADM-11).\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Conoco Billings Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. \n\nThe final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features; procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides a final check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. Additional information, including management responsibilities, can be found in our document Pre-startup Safety Review, (PSM-ADM-08).\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Conoco Billings Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: \n  - conducting training, \n  - developing written mechanical activity procedures,\n  - performing inspections and tests according to our mechanical integrity plan,\n  - correcting identified deficiencies, and\n  - applying quality assurance measures.\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. Maintenance personnel receive training on:\n  - an overview of the process,\n  - safety and health hazards,\n  - applicable maintenance procedures, \n  - emergency response plans, and\n  - applicable safe work practices.\n\nWritten mechanical department activity procedures help ensure that work is p"
