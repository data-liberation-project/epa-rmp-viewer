The previous submittal was completed using the 2004 RMP*Submit and a diskette, which allowed the submitter to document one \"Program\" under section 7 for similar processes. For that submittal, one \"Program\" was completed for the Chiller Group A, B, anc C ammonia processes. For the 2010 correction, the software does not appear to allow for one \"Program\" when there are multiple processes; therefore, the answers provided for process #78244 were repeated for processes 78242 and 78243. There is no new equipment or processes associated with this submittal.\n\n\n\nA correction was made to the RMP in December 2011 to address the sulfur dioxide incident that occurred on February 2011 and to reflect the change in the emergency contact.\n\n\n\nThe RMP was updated in September 2012 to address the installation of a fourth ammonia refrigeration system (Chiller Group D), which has a maximum intended inventory in excess of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nA correction was made to the RMP in February 2013 to reflect the change in the RMP Responsible Person and to correct the ammonia inventory for Chiller Group A.  This revision also addresses minor changes to this document based on The Wine Group's review.\n\n\n\nThe RMP was updated in November 2013 to meet the five year revalidation requirement.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities. Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs at the faclity. These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Action Plan,"

In the case of an ammonia related or sulfur dioxide-related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.\n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system. In the event that an ammonia or sulfur dioxide leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc. Maintenance Manager and Safety Representative (Supervisor). The Supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility is located at 17000 E. Highway 120 in Ripon, California, which is on the 120 Highway and approximately 5 miles east of Highway 99. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with farmland and residential areas.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Systems:\n\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of grape juice, wine, and distilled spirits.  In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 123,956 pounds of ammonia in its four independent ammonia refrigeration systems.  The four systems (A, B, C, and D) each contain the following charge of ammonia: 21,600 pounds, 35,628 pounds, 35,628 pounds, and 31,100 pounds, respectively.  The refrigerat"

Typical operating conditions range from approximately 10 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide Systems:\n\nThe facility has one sulfur dioxide filling station where hand-held dispensers are filled from a one-ton cylinder.  There is one central storage location where cylinders are delivered, and The Wine Group uses a forklift to move the cylinders to the filling station as needed.  There is a maximum of one (1) one-ton cylinder at the filling station and five (5) one-ton cylinders at the storage location.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  This prevention program covers those processes that handle sulfur dioxide and ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\n- Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n\n- In depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n\n- Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used "

On February 23, 2011, approximately 5 pounds of gaseous sulfur dioxide was released through a transfer hose failure, resulting in the injury of one employee. No other onsite impacts occurred, no off site impacts and no environmental or property damage occurred. Off-site responders were notified but did not respond.
