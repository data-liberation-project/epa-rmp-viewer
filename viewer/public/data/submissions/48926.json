(SUGS) is a publicly held company that has been in the gas processing business for more than 50 years.  SUGS operates natural gas processing plants in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas.    The Coyanosa gas plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained operating personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\n\n\nThe facility receives well gas from the surrounding oil and gas fields, processes the gas by removing carbon dioxide and water and transports the natural gas liquids as well as the compressed natural gas through pipelines to third party customers.  The only compound present at the facility that contains substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) in amounts greater than threshold quantity is de-methanized natural gas liquids (NGL) which is reported as a flammable mixture.  The RMP-regulated substances found in NGL are ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Tippett Plant is located south southwest of McCamey, in Crockett County, Texas, at coordinates of Latitude 31 degrees 02' 12\" and Longitude 102 degrees 13' 17\".  \n\n\n\nAs specified by the U"

      "SummaryText": ". S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release would be the loss of all of the flammable mixture (NGL) in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Tippett Gas Plant, this would involve a 71,480-gallon storage vessel.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance that the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.6 miles (approximately 3,200 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  \n\n\n\nPotential releases have been discussed with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Crockett County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\n\n\nThe Tippett Gas Plant operates under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety has helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n* Installation of ?fire eyes?, that sense UV waves, in the engine room to automatically shut down the compressors in case of fire.\n\n\n\n* Installation of pumps with dual seals and an alarm for primary seal failure.\n\n\n\n* Installation of a continuous lit natural gas flare.\n\n\n\n* Fire water monitors that will spray water onto equipment. \n\n\n\n* Emergency shutdown valves for removing the product from the system during emergency situations along with automatic pump shutdown.\n\n\n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped plant to operate safely.\n\n\n\nNo incident having resulted in offsite or onsite "

Daily emphasis on prevention and safety programs should ensure this record continues.\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) specific to the facility is in place and has been coordinated with the McCamey Volunteer Fire Department and the Crockett County Sheriff.  The Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  The ERP in place deals with evacuation procedures, training, etc.  The ERP provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Tippett Gas Plant.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n\n\n* The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n\n\n* The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n\n\n\n* The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n\n\n\n* Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n\n\n\n* An ongoing dialogue with the Crockett County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.
