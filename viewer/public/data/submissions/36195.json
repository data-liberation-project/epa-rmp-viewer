Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Ainsworth) are\n     committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. \n     Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's\n     job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement\n     appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an\n     accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency\n     Action Plan and is prepared to work with local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning\n     Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of \n     the release to employees, the environment, and general public.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. \n     Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one 30,000-gallon storage tank. This tank\n     is located in the Northeast corner of the facility. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia \n     stored in this stationary point would be 131,000 pounds.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also stored in\n     61-1000 gal wagons which are stored in the Southwest corner of the facility.  The maximum\n     quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in this stationary point would be 268,000 pounds.  \n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenerio\n\n     a.     The worst-case scenerio for each chemical would be the release of the total\n             contents of the largest storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia Storage Tank "

The distance to the end point (point of\n             dispersion of the gas to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.6 miles.\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia Wagon - The maximum quantity released would be 4400 pounds,\n             which represents the volume of one anhydrous ammonia wagon at 85 percent capacity\n             as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion of the\n             gas to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 0.5 miles.\n\n     b.     The alternate release scenarios, based on the most likely potential incident, or the\n             five-year accident history, are:\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia Storage Tank - A release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose,\n             lasting 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off intervenes to stop the flow.  The\n             maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint\n             (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia Wagon - A release from a valve of the wagon through a 1.5 inch\n             opening, lasting 2 minutes or before automatic or manual shut-off intervenes to stop the flow.\n             The maximum quanitiy released would be 3600 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint\n             (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.5 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     1) Safety Equipment: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable\n     Federal and State of Iowa regulators.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are\n     periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.

The reviews identify the opportunity\n     for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards\n     used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.\n     The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written procedures for the handling and storage of\n     anhydrous ammonia.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the\n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.111,\"Storage and\n     Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa\n     Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and handling of\n     anhydrous ammonia. The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular \n     basis and revised as necessary.\n\n     4)  Training: All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training\n     program.  Training of all employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g. reading safety\n     information, operating procedures, response measures followed by a written test) and on-the-job\n     supervision.  All employees are trained annually.  The training program is reviewed by facility\n     management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.  \n\n     5) Maintenance: The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.\n     Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on\n     an annual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions\n     furnished by equipment vendors, Federal or State requlators, or Industry Codes.  "

The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable\n     in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Corrective actions required\n     as a result of each compliance audit will be performed and documented.\n\n     7) Incident Investigation: Facility management will investigate each incident that results, or could have\n     reasonably resulted in a catastropic release of anhydrous ammonia.  The investigation\n     will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to\n     prevent the release from reoccuring.
