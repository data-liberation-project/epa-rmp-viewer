We have 6 regulated substance that could be present at our facility; Ammonia (anhydrous), Carbon Disulfide, Methyl Mercaptan, 2- Butene,1,3 Butadiene, Propylene, and Ethyl Mercaptan.   Ammonia is used to reduce emissions from the sulfuric acid plant.  Carbon Disulfide, Methyl Mercaptan, 2- Butene, 1,3 Butadiene,Propylene, and Ethyl Mercaptan are parts of  mixtures that are used as feed stocks to recover sulfur to make sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Solvay Baytown Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Solvay Baytown Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are LOPA, Checklist, HAZOP and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nOp"
