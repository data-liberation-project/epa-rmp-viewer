The prevention program shares some policies and procedures (e.g. Contractor qualifications, Hot Work permitting, Compliance Audits) with the other processes in the Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex but retains process specific program information on some issues such as Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, and portions of other issues where necessary.  Some issues in the program contain information specific to the Propane Dehydrogenation Process, but share procedures, files, or databases with other issues (e.g. Process Safety Information; Mechanical Integrity, some technician Training, etc.).  Additional details on the complete Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex accident prevention / safety management program can be found in the Executive Summary.",

              "Description": "The Isobutane Dehydrogenation Process at the Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex has a complete 14-issue safety management program designed to be compliant with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule.  The prevention program shares some policies and procedures (e.g. Contractor qualifications, Hot Work permitting, Compliance Audits) with the other processes in the Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex but retains process specific program information on some issues such as Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, and portions of other issues where necessary.  Some issues in the program contain information specific to the Isobutane Dehydrogenation Process, but share procedures, files, or databases with other issues (e.g. Process Safety Information; Mechanical Integrity, some technician Training, etc.).  Additional details on the complete Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex accident prevention / safety management program can be found in the Executive Summary.",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex is located at 129010 Hatcherville Road, Baytown, Texas in Chambers County.\n\n\n\nThe Propane Dehydrogenation Unit receives liquid propane feed stock which is then vaporized and sent to the Catofin Reactors where it is partially converted to propylene and hydrogen along with additional by-products.  The mixed stream is then sent first through a deethanizer to recover the lighter products and then through a splitter to recover the propylene.  The propane is recycled into the feed stock and the by-products sent to the Mont Belvieu Main Complex for further processing.  Two refrigeration systems are used in the recovery process, one using propylene as a refrigerant and the other using ethylene.  Feed stock and products are transported to and from the facility via pipeline.  Ethylene refrigerant can be delivered via pipeline or truck.\n\n\n\nThe Isobutane Dehydrogenation Unit receives liquid isobutane feed stock which passes through Hot Combined Feed Exchanger (HCFE), three reactors in series, and a heater system composed of a charge heater and two inter-stage heaters. The resulting product is then passed through a cryogenic processing unit,"
