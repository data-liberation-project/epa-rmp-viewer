GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe Saputo \u2013Murray facility follows the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management program as a release prevention program for RMP. In addition, Saputo Corporate \u2013 Department of Refrigeration Services works with the plant confirming regulatory and corporate standards are being followed, providing guidance and standardization on the RMP and OSHA PSM programs and acting as a resource for the plant on the RMP, PSM and other environmental programs.\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSaputo \u2013 Murray facility has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\n\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSaputo \u2013 Murray facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Specific employees are trained and certified as medical responders. Employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\n\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate \u2013 Department of Refrigeration Services, Health & Safety,"
