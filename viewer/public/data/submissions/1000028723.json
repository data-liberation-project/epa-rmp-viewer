      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) Baxter Compressor Station.  The facility qualifies for Program Level 1 based on its offsite consequences analysis and that there have been no significant accidental releases of one or more of the regulated substances from a covered process in the five years prior to the submission of this RMP. PSCo management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the RMP manual.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nPublic Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) takes and active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSCo has established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and response.  The procedures are contained within the Risk Management Plan and are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised as needed to accommodate changes in the process.  PSCo management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\nThe Baxter Compressor Station processes 2-6 mmscf/day of natural gas produced from the Dakota formation in western Colorado.  The station provides compression, dehydration, and recovery of liquid hydrocarbon compounds.  Most of the gas processed at the station is distributed for local residential use.\r\n\r\nThere are two active pressure tanks at the site. One of the two tanks has a maximum capacity of 18,000 gallons with an administrative capacity o"

Filling of the tanks is administratively limited to 80% of the tank capacity by NFPA 58 requirements, as corrected for facility elevation.\r\n\r\nThe RMP-regulated portion of the facility starts at the bypass between the dehydrator and the J-T skid.  The RMP-regulated process includes the J-T skid, the dehydrator emission control condenser, and the condensate storage.  Since the BTEX (from the emission control process) and the condensate are co-mingled, the RMP process includes the piping from the condensate storage tanks back toward the BTEX emission control process.  The inclusion of the dehydrator BTEX emission control process stops at the check valve after the pump at the BTEX condenser.  The balance of the facility is regulated under the DOT Pipeline Safety regulations Parts 190-199.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nRelease prevention at the Baxter Compressor Station is in compliance with EPA's Risk Management Program standard.  PSCo has taken several technical and administrative steps beyond those specified in the standards to prevent a release.  Passive mitigation includes a secondary containment berm around the product tank.  Administrative controls require personnel onsite when contractors are unloading product from the tank.  \r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History:\r\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nThis facility does not maintain its own emergency response plan pursuant to 40 CRR 68.95.  However, the facility does maintain procedures for evacuating the facility, shutting down the process, and contacting local emergency responders.  The facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and th"
