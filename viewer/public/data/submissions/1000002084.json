      "SummaryText": "Overview:\nThe purpose of this document is to inform interested parties that Metalor (formerly AMI Doduco, Inc.) is complying with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Program (RMP) under the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r)(7).  This regulation is published in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  The CAA required USEPA to develop the RMP in an effort to help prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to reduce the severity of a release should one occur.  Metalor's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  This emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to this facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  \n\nThe Metalor manufacturing facility located at 1003 Corporate Lane, Export, PA has one of the regulated substances, liquefied anhydrous ammonia, that is stored in one aboveground storage tank.   The storage tank is located on the north side of the facility.  \n\nLiquefied ammonia is vaporized prior to entering one of several high temperature dissociator units.  As the ammonia vapors pass through an electrically heated retort and heated to 1750oF while passing over a nickel catalyst, the ammonia is \"cracked\" or dissociated into a mixture of 75% hydrogen and 25% nitrogen.  The \"cracked\" ammonia is dried before entering individual electric furnaces where it is used to create a reducing internal furnace atmosphere.  \n\nHazard Assessment:   \nMetalor's written hazard assessment program evaluates the hazards that may exist with the ammonia system, assesses the risks involved, and determines ways to reduce the probability of an accidental release of ammonia into the atmosphere.  The program also provides for determination of the impact of significant accidental releases on the public health and environm"

In accordance with RMP requirements, AMI hazard assessment program is reviewed and updated at least every 5 years.  \n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis:     \nEPA's RMPComp ver 1.07 software was used to predict the off-site consequence analysis for both a \"worst-case\" release scenario and an \"alternative\" case release scenario.  The software provides the distance to the toxic endpoint, which is the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to 0.14 mg/l that is the Emergency Planning Guideline Level-2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined as the \"maximum airborne concentration\" below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective actions.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance is defined to estimate the population potentially affected.  \n\nPrevention Program:\nMetalor's prevention program ensures that the elements of the RMP are integrated and implemented on an ongoing basis, and that there is accountability and responsibility for the overall program and for each part of the program.  The prevention program addresses the following elements that are tailored to suit the degree of hazards present at this facility and the degree of complexity to the facility's operation.   \n\nA. Employee Participation - Employee participation is a required element in Process Safety and Risk Management.  All employees have ready access to elements of the RMP Plan.  All employees involved with the operation of the anhydrous ammonia system receive detailed training for all activities relating to the operation and maintenance of the system.  New employees receive training prior to being allowed to operate any portion of the anhydrous ammonia system.  Refresher training is provid"

Training - The intent of the training program is to increase employee awareness of the process hazards that are associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.  Each new employee involved with the process is trained with an overview and the proper operating procedures for the process.  Refresher training is conducted annually and whenever a process change is made. \n\nC. Process Safety Information - Written process safety information regarding the anhydrous ammonia process was compiled to enable employees involved in the operating process to identify and understand the potential hazards of the process. \n\nD. Process Hazard Analysis - The operators, who have expertise and knowledge specific to the anhydrous ammonia process, perform each process hazard analysis.  Review and updates of the process hazard analysis are conducted every 3 years.  \n\nE. Mechanical Integrity - All equipment used to process, store or handle anhydrous ammonia is designed, constructed, and maintained in order to minimize the risk of an ammonia release.  The frequency of mechanical inspections depends upon the part of the system being inspected and in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.  \n\nF. Operating Procedures - The Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide clear instructions for properly conducting all activities associated with the ammonia system equipment. Operating procedures are reviewed annually for content and accuracy.  \n\nG. Management of Change - Prior to implementing a change in the ammonia process the change is identified, reviewed, and authorized prior to implementation.  A process change authorization is required for any changes to ensure the operating procedure contains the operating parameters and the importance of operating within the limits.  Management of change covers changes such as process technology changes and changes to equipment and instrumentation.  \n\nH.

Additionally, process safety information and operating procedures are updated to reflect the changes necessary.  \n\nI. Contractors - Prior to starting any work on or adjacent to the ammonia system equipment, contractors are required to provide detailed information regarding their safety and health performance record.  Contractors are then informed of all potential hazards they may be exposed to; emergency action plans in place, and required safe work practices.  They are also informed of their responsibilities to ensure that their employees receive the necessary training.  Periodic inspections of the contractor's performance are conducted to ensure safe work practices are being followed.  Documentation is maintained that all the listed requirements have been met.  \n\nJ. Hot Work Permit - The hot work permits issued at the facility document that all fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to the start of any hot work operations.  Each permit, which must be issued identifies the date(s) authorized to perform the hot work and the equipment on which the hot work is to be performed, as well as site preparation and safety equipment requirements and documentation.  \n\nK. Incident Investigation - Incidents that result in or could have resulted in an ammonia release are investigated within 48 hours of the incident.  Each incident is investigated in an attempt to identify the root cause of the incident and to implement corrective actions to prevent future incidents.  The incident investigation elements include a description of the accident, process description, process flow diagram, recommendations and review with affected personnel.  No accidental release of ammonia has occurred at this facility in the past five years.  \n\nL. Compliance Audits - RMP compliance audits are conduc"

Emergency Response Plan - The facility has an emergency response plan which has been coordinated and reviewed by the Westmoreland County's Emergency Management, which is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes an emergency response and notification plan.  Emergency response drills and/or evaluations are conducted annually.  Emergency operations and response procedures are also reviewed at this time.  \n\nN.
