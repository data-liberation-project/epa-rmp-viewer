The ERM covers action to be taken in case of an unplanned release.  The mechanical integrity section of PSM discusses actions taken to prevent an unplanned accidental release of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nCGP-82 is a natural gas treating and condensate stabilization facility.  The natural gas treating includes CO2 and H2S removal using amine and glycol dehydration.  Natural gas is a mixture of primarily methane, ethane, propane, and butane.  The natural gas is transported via pipeline from the facility.  Condensate stabilization includes a stabilizing tower and off gas compression.  Condensate is a mixture comprised primarily of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and hexane.  The condensate is transported via truck from the facility.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program is outlined in the mechanical integrity section of the PSM program for the facility.  Some of the main components of this section that would help prevent the accidental, uncontrolled release of regulated substances include:  testing of critical control and shutdown instruments, testing of pressure safety valves, and routing testing of piping and vessel corrosion.  In addition, process hazard analyses have been performed on the facility and all resulting action items have been met.  Lastly, safety training for key personnel has been performed.\r\n\r\nThere has not been a recordable/off-site accident since the construction of this facility.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program for this facility is contained in the ERM.  The ERM includes actions to take in case of an uncontrolled release of hazardous substance, an uncontrollable fire, and hurricanes.  The proper action includes immediately contacting the county emergency response system which in turn will contact other emergency response agencie"

In addition to utilizing PSM for hazard assessment, safety training is done in which unsafe items are discussed and resolved.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario was calculated using EPA's RMP Comp program and under the assumption that the largest volume process becomes liquid full up to the shutoff limit.  Using a compositional analysis, a flammable mixture of regulated substances was determined and the volume these substances would contain in the largest process.  This was treated to have undergone a 1psi overpressure."
