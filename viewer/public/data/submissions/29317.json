      "SummaryText": "Carper Farm Supply has been working closely with the Indiana State Chemist Office since early March 2001,to review hazards and upgrades to our facility. In addition, we utilize Murray Equipment, based in Fort Wayne in purchasing Anhydrous Ammonia upgrade equipment as well as, using their professional grade welders to install piping and critical parts.\nMany of the upgrades have been to reduce risk to the loading operater. As such, we installed a loading platform versus a manual, climb on the wagon approach. We have also eliminated long hoses and replaced with loading arms that position over the unit being loaded.  We also installed drive-away snap valves that will disconnect should someone accidently pull a unit away from the loading area. These excessive flow valves will snap shut once separated.  We have also installed emergency shutoffs for the loading operator, the truck unloading operator and the railroad unloading operator. Should a major vapor escape ensue, an operator can quickly shut down the system. We have also installed bleed-off vessels for railcar and tanktruck unloading. This eliminates vapors being released directly into the atmosphere.  Backflow valves have also been installed.  Major piping installation and revisions were necessary when we upgraded the loading and unloading areas.  Piping and valves have been painted to meet compliance and to allow easier visual aid when inspecting for joint leakage.\nWe have developed a check sheet for all of our nurse tanks for inspection of the running gear, valves, placarding and labeling and other safety items.\nWe have reviewed our emergency plan(s) with Ashley Fire Department Chief. They are our first line of defense after employees. Thus, they will provide a water curtain with their equipment and also would be the first aid responders. As of this writing, we have a fireman and a first aid responder in our employ. We have discussed at length \"what ifs\" with the firechief and this includes approaching and handli"

We also have reviewed emergency handling of Anhydrous Ammonia with local, county and state police for proper equipment and \"what if\" scenarios. This was done in conjunction with the theft of anhydrous for drug making.\nCarper Farm Supply has also begun to develop internal control documents to help us improve our safety in the area of anhydrous ammonia.  As such, we have created an internal document titled \"walk through inspection of anhydrous ammonia. We also have created and implemented a \"hot permit\" for internal contractor use. A \"management of change procedure\" has also been created for immediate use at our facility. This will greatly enhance everyone's awareness of a major change in operating technique or method and signal us to upgrade training or procedures.  We also have created a \"What if\" form and have set down with the firechief and another employee to go through some what if scenarios.\nWe believe the steps taken to enhance everyone's knowledge is critical factor in the event of an emergency. In addition, our forms will help create more of an acute awareness of safety items and emergency response by all employees and emergency response personnel.\n\nSincerely,\nJames B. Carper\nPresident"
