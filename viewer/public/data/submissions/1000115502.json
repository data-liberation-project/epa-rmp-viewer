The facility would respond to accidental releases from the covered process by:\n-\tNotification of all persons on site;\n-\tNotification of contiguous industrial site by telephone;\n-\tNotification of local fire department by telephone;\n-\tStopping equipment and isolating any equipment which may leak flammable gases;\n-\tIsolation of bulk tank via remote emergency stop; and\n-\tEvacuation of the area.\n\nCoordination is with the local fire department and LEPC.\n6.\t Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nTwo carbon monoxide (CO) monitors will be added in the PAE SMR building (one above the PSA valves and one next to the high temperature shift area).  The LEL monitors in the control room cabinet are being upgraded."

The primary function of the ALEUS facility is to supply bulk gasses to our customer via pipeline on a 24 hour, 365-day basis. Bulk gasses other than hydrogen are inert and non-regulated by this program (nitrogen). The facility manufactures hydrogen by process of catalytic reformation. During the process of manufacturing hydrogen, methane is combined with steam at high temperatures in a two-phase reaction to generate hydrogen and water. Hydrogen is stored in liquid form in stationary bulk tanks and transported in gaseous form via pipeline to the on-site customer.\n\nThe ALEUS includes two 2,765 cubic foot (20,000 US gallon) vacuum-insulated cryogenic, horizontal) tanks of liquefied hydrogen, two 4,000 cubic foot (30,000 US gallon (horizontal) tanks of hydrogen gas, and small amounts of hydrogen within the process vessels and piping.\n\n3.\t The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following specific practices are employed:\n-\tEmployees are consulted and trained on the process using standard operating procedures.\n-\t The equipment was designed by engineers.
