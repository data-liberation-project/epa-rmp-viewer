This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as safety information, hazardous materials storage procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process of hazardous materials warehousing at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is present in two different concentrations and two types of containers: Hydrogen Fluoride, Anhydrous is present in our warehouse in tank trucks. These containers are ASME carbon steel pressure vessels. Built according to DOT specifications for an MC-312 cargo tank.  Typical capacity is 5,000 gallons.  Maximum number of cargo tanks on inventory will be four. Hydrofluoric acid, 70 solution is present in 55-gallon drums. These drums can be plastic (polyethylene) or metallic with a plastic liner. These drums are all new non-reusable drums that meet DOT specifications for packaging of hydrofluoric Acid 70% solution. Maximum number of drums is 800.  \n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used EPA software RMP*Comp\u00bf.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worse case scenario was calculated using the biggest container on our warehouse. This is a 40,000 pound liquid spill and vaporization from a tank truck of hydrogen fluoride. The quantity of HF released, duration of the release, wind spe"

      "SummaryText": "ed and atmospheric stability used were the recommended values by EPA on their RMP Guidance. The tank trucks are parked outside in gated and lighted area. Therefore NO passive mitigation is available.  This scenario will have offsite consequences. The estimation of public receptors within the distance to the endpoint was determined using Landview III Environmental Mapping Software.  \nWe are reporting two alternative release scenarios: One for anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The alternative release scenario will be a release of hydrogen fluoride gas from a safety relief valve on the tank truck. The duration of the release was estimated at 15 minutes. This scenario will have offsite consequences. The number of public receptors was determined using Landview III - Environmental Mapping Software. There is no passive mitigation available. There is an emergency capping kit on every tank truck and this will be considered as active mitigation.  The second alternative release scenario will be for hydrofluoric acid, 70% solution. The scenario will be the rupture of a 55-gallon drum. The scenario is the release of liquid hydrofluoric acid from a one-inch hole caused by a forklift. This liquid release will be inside a dedicated storage building; therefore passive mitigation will be available. There will be offsite receptors. The number of public receptors was determined using Landview III. Environmental Mapping Software.   \n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
