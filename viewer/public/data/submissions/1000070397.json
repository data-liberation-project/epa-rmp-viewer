This facility has mechanisms in place as identified in \"Emergency Response Plan\" to address releases of chlorine.  If an emergency were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThis facility is a producer of sodium hypochlorite solution and temporary storer of ton containers of chlorine.  Chlorine is an intermediate product in the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite.  The liquid chlorine system has a calculated maximum chlorine quantity on-site of 920,000 pounds.   \n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nOur worst-case chlorine release scenario and alternative release scenarios were prepared utilizing RMP*COMP and MARPLOT software. The distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 14 miles and has the potential to affect 540,000 people. This submittal replaces the RMP submitted on May 3, 2016 which was prepared utilizing Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 74, Edition 6, June 2015 to calculate the toxic endpoint distance and affected population. \n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorine system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with Chlorine Institute codes and standards.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWe have had one accidental release of chlorine in excess of the reportable quantity in the past 5 years which occurred on June 10, 2014. The release quantity was 186 pounds of chlorine; no injuries were experienced.   \n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY "

Designated response personnel and procedures are identified in written plans entitled \"Emergency Response Plan\" and \"Process Safety Management, Chlorine Systems\".  Designated personnel will also perform required external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the chlorine system.\n\n"
