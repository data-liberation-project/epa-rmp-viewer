      "SummaryText": "Plant Foods, Inc. handles a variety of farm chemicals, including herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides.  They also mix and deliver fertilizers, both dry and liquid.  One railcar of anhydrous ammonia is on site and used to fill smaller nurse tank trailers that are pulled to local farms.\n\nIn the history of Plant Foods, Incorporated, there has never been a significant release of ammonia into the atmosphere.  Only during valve and hose disconnects were there any releases.  This was limited to the product in the valve, and never approached the reportable quantity listed under CERCLA.\n\nEach year, every employee must attend safety training on handling products, personal protective equipment, incident reporting requirements, and material safety data sheets.  Due to the low employee turnover rate, only experienced personnel transfer ammonia.  At all times while transfer is in progress, this employee monitors the process.  Through check valves and location of shutoffs, any unintentional release would be kept to a minimum.\n\nPlant Foods, Incorporated has had a safety consultant on retainer for the past four years.  He instructs hazardous materials training classes to emergency responders across the state and assists companies with regulatory compliance.  His name is Randy L. Holloway (phone number 1-800-313-2259).  Any questions on safety related issues can be answered by him."
