Detection system activates visual alarms at the facility main control center to alert personnel of a possible ammonia leak in the chiller system.\n\n* Ammonia detection is hard wired to ventilation system to activate exhaust fans in the event of a release in the chiller building.\n\n* Chiller System Controls monitor and control compressors, condenser, vessels and ammonia pumps. System displays continual operational status of equipment and controls alarms / shutdowns for out of  parameter indications. \n\n* High level alarms and system shut offs are installed on pressure vessels. Abnormal operating levels sensed in the vessels will activate a shutdown of the compressors.\n\n* Safety relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels to eliminate the potential for an over-pressure condition within the vessel and the refrigeration system.\n\n* Emergency stop button installed outside chiller building and in facility main control room to stop all ammonia refrigeration equipment and start exhaust fans in the event of a release.\n\n* Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) is instituted within the maintenance department to ensure all chiller system components are maintained in optimum operational and mechancal condition in accordance with industry and manufacturers recommendations.\n\n* Continual vibration analysis of compressors and condenser fans is provided to alert maintenance personnel of potential equipment malfunction, or failure.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRumford Power, Inc.,  is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. It is our goal to achieve and sustain \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Rumford Fire Department and the Oxford County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for emergency response support.\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nRumford Power, Inc. is a combined cycle power plant. The regulated substances handled on location are Anhydrous Ammonia, which is used in the Chiller System as a coolant to enhance gas turbine performance. The second regulated substance is Aqueous Ammonia, which is used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to reduce NOx emissions from the power plant.  The Chiller System regulated substance is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.  The SCR systems regulated substance is covered under Program 2 of the RMP regulations.\n\n \n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp models are referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the release scenario mathematical approximation process.\n\nThe worst case"

      "SummaryText": " and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Rumford Power, Inc. RMP Plan.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of Landview VI mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at Rumford Power, Inc. are to comply with EPA's Accidental Prevention Rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. Each process and the process equipment at Rumford Power, Inc. was designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the aforementioned codes, laws, and regulations.\n\n\n\n- Accident History\n\nRumford Power, Inc. has had no accidents associated with ammonia use.\n\n\n\n - Emergency Response Program\n\nRumford Power, Inc. is equipped with an ammonia detection and emergency alarm system for the Chiller System.  In the event of an alarm there are specific procedures that all employees must follow. These written procedures can be found in the Rumford Power, Inc. Emergency Plan.  The procedures include evacuation of personnel and notification of authorities. \n\nThe Oxford County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Rumford Fire Department are trained and equipped to respond to ammonia releases at Rumford Power, Inc.\n\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nRumford Power, Inc. currently has no changes planned for the Chiller System and SCR System at this time. However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Rumford Power, Inc. personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our p"
