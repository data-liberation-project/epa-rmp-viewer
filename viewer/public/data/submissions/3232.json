General accidental release and prevention policy of King and Prince Seafood.\r\n\r\nKing and Prince Seafood is a frozen seafood processing facility that utilizes anhydrous ammonia\r\nas a refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection\r\nAgency. The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to\r\nobserve certain safety precautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the\r\nsurrounding community and the environment.  \r\nIt is our policy at King and Prince to implement the requirements of the Risk Management\r\nProgram by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and\r\nstate regulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental\r\nrelease of hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our\r\nplant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety\r\ndevices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\r\n\r\nKing and Prince Seafood, 1 King and Prince Boulevard, Brunswick, Geaorgia operates a\r\nrefrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical\r\nrefrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat\r\nexchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration\r\ncycle consists of evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and\r\ncondensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant.\r\nCompression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy. The\r\nrefrigeration cycle is a closed"

      "SummaryText": "loop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature,\r\npressure and latent heat of vaporization for cooling. The refrigeration system uses this\r\nphenomenon to remove heat from a desired space, and then to discard that heat through\r\ncondensation, to an area where it is of no consequence.\r\n\r\nThe King and Prince Seafood facility has approximately 500 employees, including hourly and\r\nsalary personnel, that manufacture and prepare shipment of frozen seafood products via truck\r\nfrom 8:00am-5:00pm, five days a week.\r\nThe refrigeration system contains 15,500 pounds of aggregate ammonia. The potential hazards\r\nthat could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited to, equipment\r\nfailure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\r\n Although ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is it's pungent,\r\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\r\nconcentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks. Risks from\r\naccidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The\r\nextent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  \r\nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\r\nbut only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\r\n\r\n3. Worst case  and alternate case release scenarios including administrative and\r\nengineering controls to limit/ prevent accidental release.\r\n\r\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the Recirculator located in the machine\r\nroom. The recirculators normal 50% operating level is 3,600 pounds of liquid ammonia. The\r\nrecirculator is capable of holding 7,300 pounds, however, this exceeds engineering controls which\r\nlimit the liquid level to a maximum of 80% at any time.  Considering the \"catastrophic\" possibility\r\ndoes exist for this v"
