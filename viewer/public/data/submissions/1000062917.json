      "SummaryText": "SUN PACIFIC MARICOPA PACKING HOUSE\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nSun Pacific utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in two separate refrigeration systems at the Maricopa Packing House.  The A\u00bfA\u00bfdegreeningA\u00bfA\u00bf refrigeration system is located in the southeast corner of the building and provides process cooling for the facilityA\u00bfA\u00bfs forty degreening rooms.  The A\u00bfA\u00bfcold storageA\u00bfA\u00bf refrigeration system in the northwest corner of the building provides process cooling for cold storage rooms and the loading dock area.   Since the cold storage refrigeration and degreening systems handle more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, the Maricopa Packing House has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the refrigeration and degreening systems.  \r\n\r\nAs part of the PSM program, Sun Pacific completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration systems, conducted a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration systems on a daily basis, Sun Pacific has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration equipment is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Sun Pacific emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific and process specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, fire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  \r\n\r\nWhile it is Sun PacificA\u00bfA\u00bfs objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the Maricopa Packing House precludes emergency response operations."
