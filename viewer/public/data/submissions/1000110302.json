A two-person rule applies for entry into the chlorine building.\n\nThe owner/operator of the facility has implemented an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prevent an accidental release and mitigate the consequences of a chlorine release if it were to occur. The ICP follows the fourteen elements of the PSM standard and the RMP elements. The process hazard analysis (PHA) of the covered process is revalidated every 5-years and the PSM/RMP program is audited every 3-years; the City holds a Risk Management Program contract with a qualified third-party PSM/RMP consultant for assistance with these activities. PSM and RMP prevention program activities are actively managed by the facility with oversight from the Environmental Services Division of the City of Phoenix Water Services Department.\n\nThe facility is staffed 24 hours/day by a licensed Wastewater Treatment Operator. The Operator controls the chlorine system from the Operator Control Room within a separate building at the facility.\n \nThe owner/operator of the facility has implemented an Emergency Response Plan, and personnel who respond to chlorine emergencies are trained accordingly; regular chlorine drills are conducted at the facility.  In the event of a chlorine emergency, an alarm on the chlorine gas detection system will automatically notify and dispatch the Fire Department.\n\nThe facility has not experienced any significant accidental releases of the RMP-regulated substances from the covered process in the five years prior to the submission of this updated Risk Management Plan (RMP)."

      "SummaryText": "The Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is a wastewater treatment facility that disinfects and discharges treated water. The facility is operated by the City of Phoenix, Water Services Department (WSD).  The facility contains a covered process subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMP), 40 CFR 68. \n\nThe covered process contains chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5), which is injected into the treated water to provide continuous chlorine residual for disinfection.  Chlorine storage and supply (chlorine feed system) are located within a dedicated building designed to contain a chlorine release. Chlorine is supplied to the disinfection system from one-ton chlorine containers (tonners) interconnected in parallel; when in operation, there is an on-line bank, a stand-by bank, and two (2) back-up banks. The tonners connected to the feed system are equipped with motorized control valves and the chlorine feed system is automatically (or can be remotely/manually) shutdown in an emergency. Additional one-ton containers are in storage within the chlorine building awaiting transfer to the stand-by bank or depleted tonners awaiting return to the chlorine supplier.  \n\nThe chlorine building is an enclosed building designed to contain a worst-case chlorine gas release and the building is connected to an emergency scrubber that is automatically activated upon chlorine gas leak detection (or manually operated). Chlorine gas detection systems activate local alarm strobes and horns, activate the emergency scrubber for the chlorine building, and notify emergency response. The emergency scrubber will shut off upon detection of chlorine at the scrubber discharge (breakthrough) to contain chlorine within the building.  The chlorine building is a secured zone within a secured site, and all access doors to the chlorine building are secured"
