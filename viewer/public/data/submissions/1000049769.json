      "SummaryText": "GTUIT, LLC (GTUIT) is a service company that provides mobile flare gas treatment for the oil and gas industry.  GTUIT operates a mechanical refrigeration unit (MRU) type gas dew point control and liquids recovery skid designed to recover propane, butane and natural gasoline from natural gas prior to gathering and final treatment. Enerplus Resources (USA) Corporation (Enerplus) is required, by Title 40 Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), to develop this executive summary for the enclosed Risk Management Plan (RMP). This RMP is applicable to the Furbears Pad oil and gas production pad owned and operated by Enerplus.  \n\n\n\nGTUIT is a limited liability company that provides services to the oil and gas industry, and their operations are portable. GTUIT services include recovery of natural gas liquids (NGLs) which are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68. The regulated substances include natural gas liquids that contain mostly liquid petroleum gas, which is a mixture of propane and butane, with small amounts of other hydrocarbon gas such as ethane and methane.  These are considered flammable substances under 40 CFR 68. GTUIT will deliver an 18,000 gallon tank to a well site, collect these NGLs from produced gas, and then offload to a transport tanker the recovered NGLs for sale in the market. The well sites at which these collections will occur operate automatically and are considered to be unmanned. \n\n\n\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals over the regulated thresholds to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a RMP, and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004. This facility is regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of "

      "SummaryText": "the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMPs must be prepared for processes that store in excess of the thresholds set forth by 40 CFR 68.130. For natural gas components (e.g. butane, ethane and propane), the threshold is 10,000 lbs. The GTUIT MRU system stores approximately 57,146 lbs. of natural gas which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold."
