The basic raw materials used in the rayon production process are Cellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, and Carbon Disulfide (CS2).  CS2, which is a RMP regulated substance.  It is delivered to the plant via railcars and unloaded to one of the six 28,500-gallon storage tanks.  All six of the storage tanks are enclosed in a single water bath (an open concrete tank filled with water) for containment.  From the storage tanks, the CS2 is piped to the xanthation process where it is used in the production of rayon fiber.\n\nProcess and sanitary wastewater from the Liberty production facilities and the rest of the Lowland site are treated at a treatment facility on-site.  Chlorine, an RMP regulated substance, is utilized as a disinfectant.  Chlorine is a gas at ambient conditions, but is delivered to the plant in one-ton cylinders as a pressurized-liquid gas.  Two (2) one-ton cylinders are kept on-site at a time.  Only one cylinder is tied into the treatment system at a time.  The Chlorine cylinders are housed in a concrete block building that is equipped with a chlorine detection and alarm system.\n\nThe facility reports no accidental releases from December 1999 to the present.\n\nThe RMP rule defines the Worst-Case Releases as ?the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or a process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint? (40 CFR Part 68.3).  The Worst-Case Release Scenario (WSC) for the Liberty facility considers the catastrophic failure of one of the six 28,500-gallon carbon disulfide storage tanks.  In accordance with EPA guidance, it is assumed that the contents of the tank are spilled instantaneously and then evaporate to the atmosphere.  The containment walls surrounding the CS2 tanks meet the EPA criteria for passive mitigation and are therefore reflected in the RMP*Comp analysis.  For the WCS, it is conservatively assumed that there is "

      "SummaryText": "no water in the diked area covering the tanks.  Using the site specific parameters discussed above and the standard parameters for a WCS defined by EPA, RMP*Comp predicts a distance to the toxic endpoint of five (5) miles.\n\nThe RMP rule defines the Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) as release events that are more likely than the WCS.  The rule also dictates that ARS should result in off site consequences.  Liberty performed one ARS for each covered process ? one involving Carbon Disulfide (CS2) and one involving Chlorine.  The ARS for the rayon production process considers a piping/vessel leak during railcar unloading that result in the release of the total contents of a car (18,000 gallons) over a 60-minute period.  The area around the railcar unloading station is graded such that a release would drain to a containment sump filled with water thereby reducing the instantaneous evaporation rate of CS2 to the atmosphere.  RMP*Comp predicts a distance to the toxic endpoint of (2.5) miles radius for this scenario.\n\nThe ARS for the wastewater treatment facility considers the failure of process relief valve resulting in the release of 2,000 pounds of Chlorine over a 60-minute period.  While it is unlikely an event such as this would occur (considering the chlorine detection and alarm system), Liberty has in place this scenario in consideration of emergency planning purposes.  RMP*Comp predicts for this scenario, a distance to the toxic endpoint of (0.3) mile radius.\n\nCarbon Disulfide (CS2) and Chlorine are regulated substances under both the RMP and Process Safety Management (PSM) rules.  Therefore Liberty already had an active release prevention plan in place prior to the RMP.  Key components of the accident prevention program include: high level training for operators, a preventative maintenance program, technological process and safety equipment, effective operating procedures, and a routine inspection program.\n\nLiberty has in place a written emergency response progr"
