Travis Field Plant was own and operated by the military for a many years, the City of Savannah took over operation of the plant in 1972. Since, taking over the operation of the treatment facility the City of Savannah upgraded the plant, increasing the treatment capacity, the upgrade was completed in 1996. Travis Field treatment capacity 1.5 million gallons per day. The plant flows are mainly industrial with some domestic flow, these flows are treated through a biological treatment process and disinfection with chlorine prior to discharged.\nThe chlorine feed rates varies from 10 lbs. per day to 40 lbs. per day depending on the effluent quality and demand. Chlorine gas is use for disinfection of the plant effluent. The chlorine is trucked in 2000 lbs. container. \nThe chlorine system has a chlorine leak detector. The chlorine leak detector activates audible alarms to alert operation personnel if a leak occurs. \nIn February, 1999 Travis Field completed its program 2  Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The Risk Management Plan includes the following 14 components: 1) Introduction, 2) Employee Involement, 3)Process Safety, 4) Process Hazard Analysis, 5) Operating Procedures and Practices, 6) Employee Training, 7) Contractor Information, 8) Pre-Startup Safety, 9) Mechanical Integrity, 10) Non-routine Work Authorization, 11) Change Management, 12) Incident Investigaiton, 13) Emergency Preparedness, 14) Compliance Audits. The information provided within these components are not to be considered all - inclusive for every conceivable scenario. However, it is the intent of the plan to provide a organized approach to the safe operation of the chlorination system, by defining, understanding, operating, maintaining, reviewing and documenting.\nThe Treatment Adminstrator has overall responsbility for ensuring that the Process Management "

The likelihood of this happening is sligth. For the worst case scenario it is a requirement of the 40 CFR 68.25 for the largest full chlorine container on site to completely empty its contents within a 10 minute period.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint of the worst case release scenario has been determine to be 5.7 miles from the Travis Field  WQCP.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nThe alternate release scenario has been determined to be a shearing off of a1/4 inch I.D. flexible connector between the manifold and cylinder. In accordance withthe OCA guidance the maximum leak duration of 60 minutes has been used.\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint of the alternate release scenario has been determine to be .7 miles from the Wilshire  WQCP.\n\nTo reduce the risk and magnitude of potential releases, written procedures for the safe handling and operation of the chlorination system has been implemented. In addition, work performed on equipment that may be subject to cause a release, requires a minimum of two personnel. Personnel are also required to wear Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) throughout the course of work associated with the chlorination equipment. Any major work to be performed on the chlorination system is limited to day time only, to reduce the possibility of a chlorine release and to ensure suffici"
