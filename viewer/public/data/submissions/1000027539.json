To preserve our perishable products, we utilize an industrial refrigeration system to cool the storage areas where these items are kept. This system uses anhydrous (without water) ammonia as a refrigerant. Ammonia, a naturally occurring element, is part of the nitrogen cycle and is one of the oldest mechanical system refrigerants used. The properties that make ammonia one of the ideal industrial refrigerants for the food industry are the same ones the make it necessary to follow certain safety precautions. These precautions are designed to:\r\n\r\nProtect our neighbors and the surrounding community.\r\nReduce the possibility of harm to the environment.\r\nPrevent unnecessary human exposure\r\nReduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers.\r\n\r\n2.The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nAt the Aldi Incorporated Springfield Division Warehouse, our primary purpose is to supply our retail stores with high quality merchandise. To maintain the quality of our perishable food items we use a two-stage refrigeration system containing Anhydrous Ammonia. The system was charged at the startup of the system during construction of the facility and adjusted during the 2007-08 facility expansion. The system is a closed loop system that requires no additional ammonia unless the system is expanded or if an accidental release should occur.  Access to the refrigeration system areas and equipment is restricted to our trained and authorized system operation personnel, authorized maintenance personnel, authorized management personnel, and authorized approved contractors. We observe stringent safety and operating procedures and ensure that con"

All qualified refrigeration system operators have been trained and have demonstrated competence in our safety and standard operating procedures. Only qualified personnel are permitted to operate or maintain the ammonia refrigeration equipment.\r\n\r\n4.Five Year Accident History.\r\n\r\nWe have had no reportable accidental releases at this facility during the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n5.The Emergency Response Program.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program was developed following the guidelines in the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) bulletin #106 Recommended Procedures in the Event of Ammonia Spills, and applicable Federal, State and Local Codes, and industry  practices. All employees are trained in emergency notification, evacuation and accountability procedures. Initial (non contact) mitigation for ammonia refrigeration system upsets will be handled by our facility's maintenance and supervisors. Only trained and authorized employees are permitted to actively participate in emergencies at our facility.\r\n\r\n6.The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Case Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario:\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario:\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario involves the simultaneous release of 6663 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system mechanical room.  This scenario could affect the residential population of 911 persons who live within a 1.5 mile radius of our facility.  An active preventative maintenance program,a computer control"

      "SummaryText": "system and trained and qualified operators and maintenance personnel significantly reduce the likelihood of such an occurrence at the facility.   \r\n\r\nAlternative Case Scenario:\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Case Scenario involves the release of 1,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period that could occur during a transfer hose leak during the delivery of anhydrous ammonia to the facility.  This scenario would not affect any residential population within the .20 mile radius that would be affected by such an event. The use of S.O.P.trained and qualified operators, maintenance personnel and anhydrous ammonia suppliers significantly reduce the likelihood of such an occurrence at the facility.  \r\n\r\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nWe will continue our annual facility evacuation drills and planning/training site visits with the Springfield Fire Department and Hazmat Teams in the future. We will continue to utilize 3rd party consultants to inspect our facility for deficiencies in the system mechanical integrity and audit PSM compliance.  Any reported deficiencies will be corrected, in a timely manner."
