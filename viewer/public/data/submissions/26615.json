Facility Policy\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental  release of NH3 or any other chemical that is stored at this facility.  The Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries \"AG-21\" member, one of only three in the state of Kansas.  AG-21is a program that is Environmental Driven.  The Coop goes above and beyond industry standards for the safety of customers, employees, and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\nThe NH3 plant is located in Boyd Kansas, whcihc is located four miles west of Hosiington Kansas.  The town of Boyd has been unpopulated for a number of years.  Only one house remains directly north of the facility.  The Facility has two tanks of 30,000 and 11,000 gallons each.  This facillity, once or twice per year, for 24 to 48 hours.  Anyhdrous Ammonia is used in a process (t-reactor) of blending to make 10-34-0 started grade liquid fertilizer.  \n\n3.  The Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenario\nWorst case scenario would release 191,601 in a ten minute period, or 19,200 pounds per minute, with a five mile endpoint.  The alternate release involves over filling of a nurse trailer and this would only travel 0.10 to end point.  The alternate releae that are expressed are estimates.\n\n4.  Accidedntal Release Prevention Program\nThe Coop recognizes all safety procedures required by State and Federal Regulations.  The Coop also complies with recommendations form Farmland's AG-21 policies and general industry standards.  The most common accidental release would be from over filling nurse trailers.  An example would be if a trailer wouuld be filled from 85-90%% on a cool  morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valve to let product escape.  The Great Bend Coop's policy to not to fill trailers over 86%.\n\n5.  Five Year Accidental History\nThe Coop has an Emergency Response Plan, Eme"
