The facility employs 18 people on a full time basis.  At this facility, Advance repackages Chlorine, stores and handles both Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Chlorine has many beneficial uses, some of which include the production of consumer goods such as plastics, pipe, automobile parts, and toys among a few, but Chlorine's main use in this area remains the treatment of waters ensuring safe drinking water for all.  Sulfur Dioxide is also used in the treatment of water among other uses.  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community as well as to that of the people in our company.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations. \n\n\n                                                2 of 4\n\nAdvance Chemical maintains continuous efforts toward constantly improving its community status as a valuable asset to the city of Nowata.  This is accomplished through several special activities along with the company generating a substantial tax base for ongoing improvements for the city, and the county. \n\nOne such activity that the company participates in as a member is the Nowata County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This committee in conjunction with other groups is responsible for pre-planning the safety of all citizens within the city, and county during emergencies and natural disasters.  Advance Chemical provides the county LEPC with a meeting place at its facility free of charge.  Company management personnel have conducted meeting topics for LEPC on numerous occasions. Advance has also conducted safety seminars at various locations throughout, Ok"

The goals of these seminars are to enhance the knowledge of the attendees in the fields of preventing, responding safely to, and controlling emergencies in the event of a release.  Seminar attendees include people from industrial plants, city water and waste treatment plants, emergency response companies, city and county police departments, city and county fire departments, state emergency management agencies, local governments, the news media, interested citizens, and neighbors, among others.             \n\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Emergency Programs in place at the facility include an:\n\nEmergency Action Plan, \nFire Prevention Plan,\nEmergency Response Plan, and a\nTransportation Emergency Plan.\n    \nAlong with these written plans, Advance also maintains a facility organization plan that outlines the responsibilities of each job description from top management positions to the newest employee.  The General Manager and the Environmental Coordinator for the mid-west region both maintains an office in the Tulsa area.   Their responsibilities include overseeing the management of environmental, health, and safety programs for the entire company. The Branch Manager of the facility maintains direct responsibility for the plant in conjunction with his staff, the Plant Manager, the Site Safety Officer, and other management employees.  \n\nAdvance Chemical maintains a close working relationship with local emergency responders.  Emergency responders from the city fire department and third party companies are invited to tour the facility annually in order to gain knowledge of the physical setup of the plant.  This information becomes very valuable during an emergency incident.  The company also maintains a working relationship with area clinics and hospitals in order to be prepared during emergency events of any kind.   \n\n\n\n\n\n                                    "

      "SummaryText": "            3 of 4\n\nWORST CASE & ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe EPA was mandated by the law to define the Worst Case Scenario (WCS), as an unlikely event: the largest single storage vessel losing all of its contents in 10 minutes.  Advance Chemical's Nowata facility does have off-site consequences to the public and the environment under this law. \n\nEfforts maintained by the facility to prevent such an incident from occurring include several programs.  One basic program is the general housekeeping policy for the entire plant with a special emphasis placed on the storage areas for these containers.  Under this policy, combustible materials, and other products are not allowed to build up or to be stored in the processing or storage areas.  Another important program is implementing the knowledge gained from being a member of The Chlorine Institute for fifteen years. The Institute establishes written pamphlets, and videos among other information to guide facilities in prevention and emergency programs that cover issues such as processing, handling, storage, and releases of chemicals such as Chlorine.  Along with the numerous training programs from the Institute, the facility also complies with container specifications, inspections, and testing requirements of laws in-acted by the Department of Transportation.  Still other programs such as the NACD's Responsible Distribution Process, and guidance implemented based on EPA's SARA Title III regulations aids the facility in setting-up, and maintaining a more safe plant due to issues like the separation of products within certain areas of the facility.  Programs like these coupled with company policy help to ensure that the possibility of a release of this magnitude would never occur at the facility.  \n\nThe EPA calls a more likely incident, many of which will have limited or no off-site consequences, an Alternate Release Scenario (ARS).  An ARS for this facility could be a small hose or vessel leak.  For the Nowata facility the ARS wi"

This equipment includes Chlorine Institute approved kits for railcars, ton containers, and cylinders, along with a recovery vessel located at another nearby company facility.  Advance Chemical maintains employees who are trained in the specialized use of this emergency equipment. \n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nHCI USA Distribution Co., Inc maintains Health, Safety and Environmental manuals, which contain company policies for Risk Management, Training, Product Stewardship, Community Outreach and Hazard Communication among others.  The manuals also include Emergency Action Plans, Emergency Response Plans, and Transportation Emergency Plans. The facility is also in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard which requires careful reviews of the hazards and the safeguards that must be implemented to prevent releases of regulated chemicals.

To correct the leak, the container valve was simply closed.  The release occurred inside the plant and caused no injury to company personnel or damage to equipment.  Off-site, the vapors did cause minor damage to vegetation, but did not require the evacuation of nearby neighbors.  Following this incident, Advance has made several changes to the repackaging process \nand has re-trained the operators who rebuilds, inspects and tests the valves use in chlorine service.                           \n\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has emergency plans, which have been coordinated with local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The branch invites the local fire department; third party emergency response companies, and other \ndepartments and agencies to joint training events, and to annual plant tours. All of our safety equipment at the plant is Y2K compatible.\n\nOur response plan for chlorine is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The emergency response plans for all of our facilities include procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\n\nThe Nowata facility has made several changes over the years to enhance the safe repackaging, handling and storage of compressed liquefied gases such as Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  Some of these changes have occurred due to plant inspections based upon information from industrial associations such as The Chlorine Institute and the NACD; still others are based upon internal company policies.  While most of the changes have been accomplished in the past, the company continuously inspects and audits its facility to identify any existing needs.
