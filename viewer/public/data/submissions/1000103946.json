Nevertheless, RCS / Packing and Cooling continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety. By utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved RCS / Packing and Cooling's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that RCS / Packing and Cooling's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nRCS / Packing and Cooling has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, RCS / Packing and Cooling has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. For the future, RCS / Packing and Cooling now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for RCS / Packing and Cooling employees, but a"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nRCS / Packing and Cooling has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the RCS / Packing and Cooling facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 45,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nRCS / Packing and Cooling has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nRCS / Packing and Cooling's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- California Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\n- Federal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \n\nStrategically, we will respond mi"

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at RCS / Packing and Cooling consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.
