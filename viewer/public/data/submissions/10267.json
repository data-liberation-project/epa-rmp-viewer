To help ensure the safety of Conoco operations, the company invests significant resources in accident prevention.  Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes, and operations facilities.  Conoco's policies and dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help to prevent accidental releases.  If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with the plant's Incident Response Plan. \n \nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's new Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator, located at 68 El Paso Circle, Gallup, New Mexico, is owned and operated by Conoco Inc.  Wingate Fractinator is a natural gas liquids processing plant that receives raw product by pipeline.  The facility operates one fractionation train, which separates hydrocarbon liquids in the raw product streams.  Wingate Fractionator includes fractionation, product storage and loading equipment.  Products are transported from the facility via pipeline, truck, and railcar.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the Wingate Fractionator's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were on the plant site in quantities above the threshold quantities.  [Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our e"

[Note:  Natural gasoline is exempt from threshold determination based on its National fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 3.]  There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the plant does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure  For flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  n-Butane was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the n-butane in the largest n-butane vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantaneously released.  We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors.

For the Wingate Fractionator, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a shear of a 2-inch pipe on the truck rack during loading of propane causing the entire contents to empty from the truck tank.  The alternative release scenario has off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These policies and procedures include and embrace the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements of the Risk Management Program that are currently in operation at the Wingate Fractionator.  The Wingate Fractionator has aligned and integrated its safety management programs at a high level with the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program regulations for consistency and effectiveness.

Operating procedures that address various modes of process operations are maintained, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide the basis for consistent training of new operators, and they provide good reference materials for experienced operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. Whenever a process modification is made, the procedures are revised as appropriate to cover the modification.  The procedures are kept current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThese procedures are used in employee training, and are readily available to employees to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator employs a comprehensive training program for all employees at the plant.  New employees receive job-specific basic training in gas plant operations. All operating and maintenance personnel receive facility-specific process overview training.  Each employee receives training on, among other things, (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  They are thereby trained in the specific knowledge, skills, and procedures needed to safely conduct their work.  In addition, each operator receives facility-specific training on how to operate the plant, including detailed training on the operating procedures, including startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, and emergency operations.

The Wingate Fractionator has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the plant's processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.  A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training regarding the process modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
