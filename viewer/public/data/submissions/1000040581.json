This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Ocoee Fire Department which provides emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the storage and distribution of foodservice products.   Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process.\r\n\r\n\r\n 4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.
