      "SummaryText": "THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIn this facility, we use anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  This material is used to provide cooling for the process and for controlling humidity.  It is our policy to have programs in place dealing with safety precautions in handling this material and to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the health of all workers, and to be a good industrial neighbor for the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the IIAR's \"Risk Management Guidelines Program for Ammonia Refrigeration.  This plan has been provided and reviewed with the St. Francis Local Emergency Planning Coordinator.  All incidents that may have potential to affect the community will be reported to this agency.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThis facility processes raw meats into hot dogs for human consumption.  Currently the facility is not operating due to business and other reasons.  The majority of our workforce has been laid off and restart is anticipated soon.  The  Plant Engineer and his trained staff continue to operate the refrigeration system\nin order maintain meat storage coolers and freezers.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the refrigerant used for the cooling process due to the low cost of the medium and the low temperatures that must be obtained.  The ammonia is enclosed within a closed loop system that removes heat from the product and storage rooms.  The ammonia is evaporated by removing heat from the products and cooling areas at low temperature and pressures and then dispenses the heat at high pressures and temperatures to outside air.\n\nOur plant has been in operations for five years and the total ammonia on site is near 14,000 pounds\n\nSUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS  / CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO CONTROL HAZARDS\n\nHEALTH HAZARDS :  Ammonia is a colorless gas with "

      "SummaryText": "extremely pungent odor.  Liquid ammonia vaporizes to a poisonous gas cloud.  Ammonia is a severe irritant of the eyes.  It penetrates the eyes more readily than any othe alkali.  Contact with liquid ammonia and concentrated solutions can produce severe eye injury or blindness.  Exposure of the eyes to high gas concentrations can cause temporary blindness and severe eye damage.  Laceration or watering of the eyes can occur upon exposure to 150 ppm ammonia gas and higher.\n\nAmmonia is an irriitant by inhalation.  At increasing concentrations it can cause symptoms ranging from runny nose, coughing , chest pain, trouble breathing, and death.  It can cause severe breathing difficulties that are delayed in onset.  Inhalation of concentrations of 2500 to 6500 ppm causes shortness of breath, bronchospasm, chest pain, and pulmonary edema that may be fatal.\n\nExposure of the skin to liquid anhydrous ammonia  or high concentrations of the gas can cause first and second degree burns of the skin.  Vapor concentrations of 10,000 ppm are mildly irritating to moist skin, while 30,000 ppm or greater causes a stinging sensation and can produce skin burns and blisters.  These high concentrations are corrosive to moist skin and other moist body tissue.\n\nPHYSICAL HAZARDS :  Ammonia or ammonia with oil or other debris is an explosion hazard when exposed to flame or fire.  The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) is 16% and the Upper Explosive Limit is 25% by volume in air.  Elevated temperatures can cause containers of the substance to explode.  Ammonia emits toxic fumes when exposed to heat.  When heated to temperatures above 850 degrees (F), ammonia will emit hydrogen gas.  The auto ignition temperature is 1204 degrees (F) if catalyzed by iron.\n\nAmmonia can react to form violent or explosive reactions with halogens (e.g. chlorine, bromine).  It can react to form potentially violent or explosive reactions with strong oxidizers, hypochlorite bleaches, silver compounds, mercury compounds, gold, othe"

As a closed system, exposure potentials are primarily related to equipment failure, fugitve emissions from improperly adjusted or worn valve packings, pump and compressor seals and pipe connector gaskets, or mistakes in operation of the system.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO - TOXIC CASE\n\nThe worst case scenario for a toxic substance release at Thorn Apple Valley is the release of 9900 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from the system's largest vessel, the high pressure receiver, in a 10 minute period.  The toxic endpoint was determined by using the Cameo/Marplot/Aloha computer modeling program.  With a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and a Stability Class of \"F\" in an urban topography, the endpoint of the release was determined to be 0.92 miles from the receiver.  The plant is located in the suburbs of Forrest City, Arkansas with low density commercial establishments and mostly flat areas with rice and wheat fields.\n\nThe public receptors within a radius of 0.92 miles from the plant include 1 school, several business (~ 4), 1 industrial employee's recreation area, and less than 10 residences.\n\nALTERNATE CASE SCENARIO - TOXIC CASE\n\nAlternate case scenario for our facility was reviewed by the engineering and operations departments.  Considerations were given to the most probable cause of a leak within the ammonia system.  The possible leak scenarios considered were:\n\n* transfer hose rupture\n* process piping failure\n* process vessel or pump release from seals, drains, bleeds\n* rupture of sightglass\n* overpressure and release through relief valves\n\nIt was decided that a process piping failure was the most probable cause.

This would release 2500 pounds for 49 minutes at 52 pounds per minute.\n\nThe public receptors in this scenario would be 2 business and 2 residences with a total residential population of less than 10.\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR HISTORY\n\nThere have been minor releases recorded and investigated but no releases or spills which resulted in on-site injury or property damage and no off-site consequences.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA recent Process Safety Management Compliance Audit was performed in May 1999 and the findings will result in several action items to be updated / completed in order to enhance our efforts to maintain safe operations at this division.  The RMP's accidental release preventative program for ammonia is covered by the elements of the PSM program.  Controls for the preventative program are acquired by :\n\n* effective preventative maintenance\n* reviews to iinsure proper design and materials\n* development of and following operating procedures\n* mechanical integrity programs that include equipment inspections / testing\n* continuous involvement of employees through training and reviews\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the IIAR's \" Risk Management Guidelines Program for Ammonia Refrigeration\".  An emergency response plan is in place to deal with incidents and emergencies that might take place on site and / or have off-site consequences.  The site maintains it's own HazMat teams with refresher training perform annually.\n\nThis RMP plan will be provided and reviewed with the St. Francis County Emergency Planning Coordinator.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe will continue to enhance our safe operations through Management's commitment, employee involvement, review and evaluation of training programs, and by expediting the action items reported on the recent PSM Compliance Audit."
