      "SummaryText": "Routh Packing operates a facility in Sandusky, Oh, which produces a variety of pork products under the Daisyfield brand name. Live hogs arrive and are humanely slaughtered under USDA supervision: the carcasses and products are refrigerated to maintain quality and safety. After packaging, the products are stored in our refrigerated warehouse facility until shipped to the customer.\n\nMost large refrigerated facilities use a chemical called anhydrous ammonia as a vital part of the refrigeration system. Ammonia  performs the same functions as the hydrochlorofluorocarbon- \u00bfFreon\u00bf refrigerants used in home air conditioners, refrigerators, automobiles, etc. Ammonia is the most environmentally friendly, energy- and capital-efficient refrigerant available for industrial applications: \u00bfFreons\u00bf are not suitable for many industrial uses. Anhydrous ammonia is also used widely as a fertilizer, both for direct injection into the ground and for manufacture of other fertilizers. Because of it moderate toxicity and slight flammability, it is considered a hazardous material.\n\nRouth Packing is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. This commitment includes the ammonia refrigeration system. To further safety in our facility, the refrigeration system is constructed under permit from local authorities, such as the building and fire departments. Additionally, we adhere where appropriate to industry-consensus codes and standards, including the ASHRAE Safety Code for Refrigeration and the IIAR-2 standard of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration. Finally, to comply with requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we implement a method called Process Safety Management to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated and maintained safely.\n\nWe use a variety of methods to ensure that accidental releases of hazardous material"

In addition to professional design and installation to accepted engineering standards, our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing:\n Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the design limits of the refrigeration  system so that our employees are fully informed.\n Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system and some major modifications to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n Operating Procedures: We provide written procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment. \n Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We use a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration systems are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\n Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed properly.\n Contactors: We carefully screen contactors who work on our property to ensure that they have a safe work record.\n Hot Work Permits: We strictly control welding and other work that could start fire near ammonia equipment.\n Emergency Response: Should a serious incident occur, we have procedures to evacuate the facility and support the Margaretta Fire Department\u00bfs response.\n Incident Investigation: After an incident, we investigate to determine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n Compliance Audits: Approximately every three years, we examine the safety program in detail to identify areas for impro"

We support the efforts of the Margaretta Fire Department and other Erie County emergency organizations by providing information and technical assistance. Some members of the responding organizations are full-time employees at Routh Packing.\n \nThrough our Process Safety Management program, we systematically look for possible system changes to improve safety in our facility. At time of writing, there are no important changes planned for safety reasons, although we are evaluating the results of our latest process hazards analysis. As changes are made ( or as process hazards analysis studies are updated \u00bf which we do on a regular schedule), safety issues and improvements are identified and made as a matter of course. Our adherence to accepted codes and standards drastically reduces the number of safety issues : safety is designed in rather than added later."
