In recent years, we have worked to make our facility safer and to minimize its effect on the environment.  This hasn't been done in a vacuum.  Forrest Paint Co. is one of the most highly regulated businesses in Eugene.\n\n\n\nWe work closely with regulatory agencies of the Federal, State, and local governments.  Our facility has been inspected by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, Federal Aviation Authority, OR-OSHA, Lane Regional Air Pollution Authority, Eugene Fire Department and the hazardous materials expert from the Eugene Fire Department.  We encourage these visits from regulatory agencies on how to make our plant safer or our processes cleaner.  We participate in the American coatings Association's \"Coatings Care\" program approved by the American Chemical Society as equivalent to \"Chem Care.\"\n\n\n\nIn 1997 to 1998, and every five years after as part of Forrest Paint's Process Safety Management Plan, we examined the covered process in our plant to determine the worst conceivable accidents.  As a result of this study, we updated and/or replaced most of our flammable raw material storage tanks.  The Eugene Fire Department inspected and approved the new facilities.  We have invited OSHA for meetings where they review our progress and our plans for the future.\n\n\n\nForrest Paint Co. is concerned about any effect our facility and our products might have on the community.  We continue to work toward making our plant and our products safer for our employees, our neighbors, our customers, and your environment.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Management/RMP Information\n\n\n\nForrest Paint Co. produces a large number of paints, coatings, aerosols and related specialty products . These products are largely used by manufacturers of original equipment (OEM) and other industrial applications.\n\n \n\nThe covered process "

      "SummaryText": "is the gassing of aerosol cans with a propellant consisting of a mixture of propane and butane.  This gas is a odorless, compressed, very flammable, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  The scope of this process is the aerosol propellant tanks, piping, and gassing equipment.\n\n\n\nThe buildings and equipment used in this process were designed specifically for the manufacturing of aerosol cans. All equipment in the gassing areas are explosion proof and/or air operated.  The Aerosol Propellant Tank Farm conforms to National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 58 LP-Gas Code 1995 edition.  Terco is the manufacturer of most of our gassing equipment.\n\n\n\nTank wagons deliver the aerosol propellant to eight special LPG storage tanks with a combined capacity of 8,096 gallons (88% maximum fill). The propellant is a mixture of 57% propane and 42% n-butane.  The propellant is handled under pressure of more than 100 psi and exists as a liquid. The propellant is pumped with a special pump through heavy duty pipe to the two aerosol gassing stations. The major gassing station is in a 6 ft. x  6 ft. cinder block building constructed with a blow out roof. This gassing station is equipped with a twin head gassing table and operates automatically. The other gassing station is hand operated, used for small orders, and is located in the aerosol can filling area.\n\n\n\nOur prevention program consists of 13 elements.  The first element is process safety information which includes chemical hazards, physical data, reactivity information, a process flow diagram, maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower limits, evaluation of the consequences of deviations, equipment in the process, piping and instrumentation diagrams, and design codes and standards employed.  The second element of our program is the process hazard analysis which is an audit of the process to find any potential problems which then requires a correction.  Other highlights of our prevention program include safe operating procedures, "
