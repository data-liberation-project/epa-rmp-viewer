The tank containers to be stored are primarily intermodal containers manufactured according to the specifications outlined by the International Organization for Standardization (\"ISO containers\") and may also include tank trailers and totes.\n\nBushy Park is owned and managed by Cooper River Partners (CRP) who provides services to nine independent companies located at the facility. The manufacturing operations include dyes and optical brighteners for the paper and detergent industries, chemical additives for the rubber industry, photographic film, pigments for the apparel industry, steel fabrication and welding, and a tire grade precipitated silica.\n\nBushy Park was established in 1970 and is located on 1650 acres on the Cooper River just a few miles east of Goose Creek, S C.  The facility has over 800 employees.  A significant economic benefit is realized by the local area, county, and state because of these businesses and operations, including those of HYDERA.  \n\nII. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nHYDERA is committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of HYDERA employees, customers, and surrounding communities.  It is HYDERA's policy to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to establish and implement responsible practices where laws and regulations do not exist.  Further, HYDERA will work with government and industry groups to foster the development of appropriate health, environment and safety programs, laws and regulations.  HYDERA will communicate with its employees, customers, suppliers, communities and the public to recognize and respond to their concerns and to improve their understanding of the health, environment and safety considerations related to HYDERA's operations.\n\nCommunity Advisory Panel (CAP)\n\nHYDERA is a member of an active C"

The CAP meets regularly to discuss safety and environmental issues and serves as a voice for the community to provide feed back to HYDERA in relation to community matters.\n\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)\n\nHYDERA participates in the Berkeley County Local Emergency Planning Committee and actively works with the county, local agencies and response groups to provide information about operations and the chemicals stored on site.  In addition, the site emergency plans have been provided to the local hospital, fire department, LEPC, and Sheriff's Department.  The site emergency response team participates in disaster drills held annually, and often trains with other off-site and local response organizations as well as other private industry personnel.\n\nCompliance and Commitment to Safety\n\nHYDERA is highly committed to the safety and health of our personnel and community.  As part of this dedication to safety, we are constantly seeking feedback from our team and neighbors to help innovate and implement new procedures that allow us to maintain these high standards.  Our existing safeguards are above the industrial standards and ensure that all chemicals are handled safety in storage, handling and within our processes.  We also work closely with our suppliers, neighboring companies, consultants, local officials, and the public to maintain stringent safety and environmental programs to minimize risks.\n\nHYDERA has developed a risk management plan in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases.  Facilities must also outline their measures to"

PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the employee and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  HYDERA is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.  \n\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nHYDERA's storage yard contains multiple RMP chemicals, both flammables (4) and toxics (7).  All chemicals are stored on concrete in ISO containers, pending shipment to the vessel's final destination. \n\nIV. RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nA worst case and alternative (more likely) scenario for Toxics and Flammables was evaluated using RMP*Comp for each RMP listed chemical stored on site above the threshold quantity.  While the worst case was based on the complete failure of the largest container, the alternative scenario is a hypothetical release that is more realistic than the loss of the entire container.  It is important to note that the impact areas defined using RMP*Comp for each chemical release did not consider active mitigation measures that would be performed by trained plant personnel and emergency responders in the event of a release. \n\nToluene 2,6-diisocyanate - TOXICS\n\nThe \"worst-case\" scenario is based on the complete failure of the largest container containing Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate which would release 7,000 gallons of the chemical in 12.1 minutes.  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint, assuming liquid temperature of 105 degrees F, is 25.0 miles.\n\nThe most likely release scenario of Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate involves a container sitting in storage with a 5 mm (0.25 cm2) leak from a flange gasket at the top outlet valve of the ISO vessel.  A realistic, yet conservative estimate of the ISO tank pressure is 1 bar (14.7 psi).  A release duration of 2 hours was chosen based on the time it would likely take to identify the release, respond with ac"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nIncident and Emergency Guidelines\n\nHYDERA has multiple safeguards in place to ensure the safe storage and handling of all covered chemicals on-site and to prevent releases.  First and foremost, our goal is to prevent any release from occurring.   In the unlikely event a release occurs, we have procedures in place to contain the release quickly and to minimiz"
