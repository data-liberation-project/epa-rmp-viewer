The chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage is located outdoors.  The chlorination and sulfur dioxide injector processes are located inside a building.  The chlorine system has one (1) one-ton container of chlorine on line and one (1) one-ton  container of chlorine on standby at any one time.  The sulfur dioxide system has one (1) one-ton container of sulfur dioxide on line and one (1) one-ton  container of sulfur dioxide on standby at any one time.  The systems are operated under vacuum using gas.  There is a Vacuum Regulator-Check Unit (Wallce & Tiernan 500 lb/24 hour capacity) which automatically shuts off the cylinder in the event of a break in the vacuum line.  The supply systems can automatically switch between the on-line and standby chlorine containers when the on-line container is depleted.\n\nThe Facility has chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors to monitor leakage in the chlorinator/sulfurator room. The sensors are located at about twelve (12) inches above floor level.  The detectors will automatically alarm at the Facility and at the main control room panel.\n\nThe Facility normally stores a maximum of four (4) one-ton chlorine cylinders and three (3) one-ton sulfur dioxide cylinders at the site at any one time.  Cylinders not in use are stored outdoors on a loading dock.  During chlorine/sulfur dioxide deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area and the cylinders are taken off the truck and placed onto the dock.\n\nNormally, the chlorinator/injector room is secured with doors that remain closed except when the system is being inspected.  Inspection takes place daily.  If a chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak is detected, the respective alarm will sound and the Operator will notify the Wastewater Treatment Plant Supervisor. The Operator and Standby will don the Self-"

The air inside the building is evacuated and fresh air is drawn into the building through upper and lower vents, respectively.  The Standby will remain outdoors in contact with the Operator, ready to call for outside assistance if needed.  The Operator and Standby are trained in chlorine safety and emergency procedures.  The Operator will shut the chlorine cylinder.  If the leakeage is not stopped, the Fire Department will be contacted.\n\nThe Facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine from this covered process in the five years prior to the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP)."
