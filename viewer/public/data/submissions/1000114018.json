Doswell employees shall not respond to an occurrence that results or is likely to result in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. In the event of such an occurrence, Doswell shall (1) take measures to protect its employees and (2) call the Hanover County Communications Center for emergency personnel and equipment to respond to the release.  \nDoswell expects employees to take actions to end a leak (e.g., by shutting a valve) or clean up a spill that do not pose an immediate health or safety hazard. Those measures shall be considered incidental emergency responses and employees are allowed such activities.\nThe Emergency Plan has instructions for notifying and coordinating with the local agency for response activities, Hanover County, in the event of a significant ammonia release at the Facility.  Hanover County will be immediately notified of any ammonia release that carries over the security fence.  Doswell's integrated plan has been shared with Hanover County officials.

In responding, employees shall not exceed the level of risk that is addressed in daily required PPE. \n\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nDoswell Energy Center is an independent electric power production facility. The site consists of a combined cycle facility (CC) and a simple cycle facility (SC). The CC facility consists of 2 units, each containing two combustion turbines, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), one steam turbine, one air-cooled condenser, and their plant support equipment.  The SC facility consists of three single simple cycle combustion turbines. The primary fuel for the CC facility fuel is natural gas with light distillate fuel oil as a backup fuel. The primary fuel for the SC facility is natural gas. \nThe CC facility uses anhydrous ammonia to control nitrous oxide emissions while burning fuel oil and natural gas for electric power production.  The ammonia is stored as a liquid under pressure, which is vaporized and mixed with air before being injected into the Selective Catalytic Reduction unit on each HRSG. The ammonia is stored in two, 10,000-gallon tanks, which have a total capacity of 103,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n3.\tPrevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nDoswell is a Program 3 facility under the classification system in 40 CFR 69, and it has a prevention program that meets the regulatory requirements. \n3.1.\tProcess Safety Information is found in the Doswell PSM / RMP Program Manual.

A Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is performed before each job or task.  If a job cannot be done safely, it is not done.  If a job is safe but has environmental concerns, it is not done. \nStandard operating procedures and a preventive maintenance program partnered with the shared values are the backbone of Doswell's prevention program.  All Operation and Maintenance Technicians are required to be qualified on the system before being allowed to work with/on that system.  The operator qualification program defines the knowledge and skill an individual must possess to operate or maintain any given system.  In addition to basic system knowledge, an individual must possess knowledge related to safety, emergency, security, integrated plant operations, and environmental impact as applies to that system.\nDoswell utilizes a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS).  Preventive maintenance (PM) work orders are issued on a periodic basis established by equipment manufacturers and equipment history.  PM's are used to maintain plant equipment in a good working order and prevent accidental releases due to normal equipment aging.  The CMMS issues and tracks corrective work orders. Premature failures, abnormal operating conditions, releases, safety incidents, and re-occurring corrective work orders are also tracked in the CMMS. \nDoswell has procedures and equipment for responding to emergencies in an orderly and safe manner. Emergency plans are utilized to provide guidance and direction in the event of an emergency.
