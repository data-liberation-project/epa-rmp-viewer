The refrigeration system is a basic closed-loop, mechanical refrigeration system. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pump or pressure differential to the production and process area evaporators for cooling and freezing purposes. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the evaporators returns to the recirculators in the engine room. The normal high- side operating pressure ranges from 125 to 185 psig. The maximum allowable working pressure is 250 psig. The quantity of ammonia used in the system to maintain the required refrigeration is 11,600 lbs.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Process Safety Management PSM program, Grecian Delight Foods Inc. has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Grecian Delight Foods, Inc. implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Grecian Delight Foods, Inc. to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Elk Grove Village - Tonne Road facility.
