The Plant is owned and operated by the Lake Arrowhead Community Services District.  The District?s initial submittal for this facility was made to USEPA and to the San Bernardino County Fire Department on June 21, 1999.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (also known as the Federal Risk Management Plan Regulations) and the California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Article 3, Section 2745.3 (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan ? CalARP RMP Regulations).  The scope of the Federal RMP and CalARP RMP includes all operations conducted at the subject facility that involve the storage, handling and/or use of chlorine (i.e., chlorine is the only regulated substance handled at the facility).\n\nES 1.0    DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary operation conducted at the Grass Valley Wastewater Treatment Plant is the treatment of wastewater (NAICS Code 22132 ? Sewage Treatment Facilities).  \n\nFacility Description\nThe Grass Valley Wastewater Treatment Plant is situated on land managed by the U.S. Forest Service.  The Plant is located at 27000 Pilot Rock Road, approximately 4-miles northwest of the Lake Arrowhead North bay area and approximately 1/3-mile west of State Highway 173.  Figure ES-1 presents a General Facility Location Map for the Plant.  Figure ES-2 presents a General Facility Layout Map for the Plant.\n\nThe Grass Valley Wastewater Treatmen"

      "SummaryText": "t Plant, first constructed in 1988, provides sanitation services to customers of the Lake Arrowhead Community Services District.  The wastewater processes at the Plant include both solids and liquids handling and include:\n?    Preliminary treatment;\n?    Primary treatment;\n?    Secondary treatment;\n?    Sludge thickening;\n?    Sludge dewatering; and\n?    Chlorination.\n\nThe final, treated effluent is discharged to percolation ponds along the Mojave River.\n\nChlorination System Description\nChlorine is stored in three one-ton containers in the Chlorination and Pump Building.  As previously shown, in Figure ES-2, the Chlorination and Pump Building is located to the back of the Plant (on the North side).  The Grass Valley Wastewater Treatment Plant injects gaseous chlorine into water to generate a chlorinated water solution which is then used for a variety of purposes onsite, primarily for final effluent disinfection.  Chlorine gas from a one ton container is pulled through a vacuum regulator assembly (mounted directly on the main container valve) under vacuum to one of three chlorinators.  The vacuum regulator serves to reduce line pressure and regulate it to a constant vacuum.  The vacuum is generated by a venturi mixer that mixes the gaseous chlorine with Plant effluent water (resulting in the chlorine solution).  The resulting chlorine solution is then distributed to one of three points of use:\n?    Effluent disinfection in the chlorine contact tank;\n?    Odor control at the gravity thickeners and headworks; and\n?    Filter fly control and to aid in removing excess filter growth at the trickling filters.\n\nFigure ES-3 presents a Simplified Block Flow Diagram for the Use of Chlorine at the Grass Valley Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe chlorine feed system uses an automatic switchover system for the two remote vacuum regulator assemblies.  On vaccum operated automatic switchover systems, each of the two vacuum regulators is equipped with a gas flow indicator at each of the two independent chlorine"

      "SummaryText": " containers.  The vacuum operated switchover unit allows chlorine gas to flow under vacuum from the regulator assembly in service to the chlorinator and the ventrui mixer until the ?online? container is depleted.  When the chlorine supply is depleted, the vacuum sealing valve on the regulator assembly closes and the vacuum level increases initiating the switching of two sealing valves in the switchover module.  With the aid of a springloaded toggle assembly, the open valve on the depleted container closes, while the valve on the ?standby? container opens.  This permits chlorine gas to flow from the ?standby? container which thus becomes the ?online? container completing the switchover without interruption.\n\nThe chlorine ton containers, regulator assemblies, and associated piping are located in an enclosed area equipped with chlorine monitors and a manually operated emergency exhaust system (referred to as the Chlorine Storage Area).  The three chlorinators, the venture mixer and associated piping are located in a separate, enclosed area also equipped with chlorine monitors and a manually operated emergency exhaust system.  The exhaust from both areas is routed to the roof and would be vented directly to the atmosphere under controlled conditions (if required).\n\nSite Security\nIn order to ensure the security of the site, the District has erected a chain link fence around the entire site.  Additionally, an intrusion security system (Simplex 3001) has been installed to monitor ALL entry doors in the chlorine storage building and the chlorinator area.  The system is tied to the Bernina Water Treatment Plant (also owned and operated by the Lake Arrowhead Community Services District) via the SCADA System.  These site security provisions are intended to prevent unauthorized access to areas of the Plant where chlorine is stored, handled or used and seek to provide an added level of safety for the storage of chlorine at the Plant.\n\nES 2.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Fed"

      "SummaryText": "eral RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n?    the worst case release; and\n?    an alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario).\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\n\nCHLORINE\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nIn this scenario, one of the one-ton container of chlorine on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.  This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the chlorine storage room or building where the one ton containers are located).  It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event. However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded.  This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely.  In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 2,000-pounds of chlorine could be released (in the worst-case).  The release of chlorine could occur outdoors or indoors.  Since the release can occur out-doors (i.e., outside of the chlorine storage room during a delivery for example) the enclosure provided by the chlorine storage room was not taken into account in evaluating the off-site consequences.  Rather, it was assumed that the chlorine released during the catastrophic accident was released outdoors forming a cloud of chlorine vapor.  The resulting vapor cloud was assumed to freely migrate off-site.

Table ES-1 provides a listing of sensitive receptors located within the vulnerable zone.  As indicated, the only sensitive receptors located within the projected vulnerable zone for the worst-case release scenario are residences and the Pilot Rock USDA Fire Station and Recreation Area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur are those which may result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 100-pounds of chlorine.  These scenarios include situations such as delivery of a leaking one-ton container of chlorine to the Plant, a pinhole leak in the chlorine transfer piping and a partial or complete failure of the chlorine transfer lines (100-percent vapor) at various points in the system (in-doors).  In order to be conservative in the estimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that 100-pounds of chlorine was released during an accident involving the complete failure of a vapor transfer line from a one ton container.  In such a situation, the loss of vacuum from the system would result in the automatic isolation of the one ton container at the container valve.  However, in order to be conservative, it was assumed that the material was released directly outdoors (although the full length of the vapor transfer lines is located indoors).  An alternative to this would be the delivery of a leaking one ton container to the Plant.  In both cases it was assumed that the release occurs over a ten-minute period.  Also in both cases, the enclosure provided by the chlorine room was not taken into account in evaluating the off-site consequences.  Utilizing this approach and set of assumptions is extremely conservative in nature and resulted in the estimation of the larg"

As such, the District, as part of its hazardous materials business plan (HMBP) for the Grass Valley Wastewater Treatment Plant, has currently developed and implemented an emergency response plan and an emergency evacuation plan.  However, as a measure to improve safety, the Plant is currently evaluating specific emergency response options for emergencies involving chlorine including shelter-in-place. \n\nES 6.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA detailed hazard and operability study (i.e., hazards analysis) was performed on ALL operations involving chlorine in order to evaluate the potential for accidental releases.
