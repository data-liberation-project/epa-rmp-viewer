It is the Robinson Cavern #1's policy to conduct its operations in accordance with the highest standards of environmental stewardship, employee and contractor safety and community responsibility. As part of this policy, the Robinson Cavern #1 has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Robinson Cavern #1 and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Robinson Cavern #1. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Robinson Cavern #1.\n\n\n\nMPL Senior Management is committed to high standards of Health, Environmental, Safety and Security performance and to using a management system approach to drive continual improvement in these areas.  To that end, MPL has adopted a policy statement setting forth specific areas of commitment including: Accident Prevention; Prevention of Pollution & Resource Conservation; Communities; Security and Emergency Preparedness; Risk Assessment; Legislative and Regulatory Compliance; Training and Education; Product Stewardship; Contractor Performance; Measurement of Performance; Continual Improvement; and Communication.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nMPL has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the public, its employees and contractors, and to the preservatio"

Robinson Cavern #1 utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, Robinson Refinery, as primary monitoring resource for Robinson Cavern #1, is instructed to communicate with Crawford County 911 dispatch to initiate Robinson Fire Department response.  Robinson Refinery ERT is dispatched via automatic aid with Robinson Fire Department.  MPL employees have coordinated emergency response to the facility with the Robinson Fire Department and Robinson Refinery ERT.\n\n\n\n1.2 Robinson Cavern #1 Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nRobinson Cavern #1 is a butane storage facility with an underground mined storage cavern. The storage cavern is used to store butane, for use in MPL's Robinson, IL refinery. The butane is covered under the RMP rule and is present at the Robinson Cavern #1 above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nRobinson Cavern #1 does not have any toxic substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule for toxic substances.\n\n\n\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Robinson Cavern Facility. Because the process at the Robinson Cavern #1 that is regulated by the RMP rule is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the Robinson Cavern #1, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nRobinson Cavern #1 encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety manag"

For specific process areas, Robinson Cavern #1 has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Robinson Cavern #1 Operations Manual. Robinson Cavern #1 ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nRobinson Cavern #1 also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nRobinson Cavern #1 has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, the covered process and any future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n\n\nRobinson Cavern #1 primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The PHA Team considers offsite effects of potential releases as part of the PHA update process. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nRobinson Cavern #1 maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed by a designated group of operations personnel and annually certified by the Robinson Operations Specialist as current and accurate. Procedures are kept current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.

New employees receive orientation training, which includes, but is not limited to, the following topics: Process Overview, Employee Involvement, General Safety Rules, Safe Work Permit, Lockout/Tagout, and Blinding and Line Breaking. After successfully completing this training, an Robinson Cavern #1 Operator Trainee is paired with a qualified Robinson Cavern #1 Operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. Trainees spend time with all qualified Robinson Cavern #1 Operators before training is complete. After trainees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, the trainee's performance and knowledge are reviewed by qualified Robinson Cavern #1 Operators and a vote is taken to determine if he/she is qualified to operate the Robinson Cavern Facility.\n\n\n\nIn addition, all Robinson Cavern #1 Operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nRobinson Cavern #1 uses contractors at the Robinson Cavern #1 to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
