This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Energy Transfer policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nRed Bluff Gas Plant uses cryogenic fractionation to separate ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from raw wellhead gas to produce marketable natural gas.  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable subtances (methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane and n-pentane)are processed, recovered and stored at the facility.  The Red Bluff Gas Plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Red Bluff Gas Plant is a new facility; therefore, no accidental releases have occurred within the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nLocal Emergency Response Coordination\n\nThe Red Bluff Gas Plant has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Red Bluff Gas Plant.  Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and the OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEnergy Transfer and the Red Bluff Gas Plant actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work enviro"

Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Red Bluff Gas Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses the physical properties of hazardous substances handled, operating parameters of the equipment, and design basis and configuration of the equipment.  Energy Transfer ensures that this process safety information is available to all Energy Transfer employees, the LEPC, and the fire department.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any know hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limited maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nThe Red Bluff Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Red Bluff Gas Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.  The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Red Bluff Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial setup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically revi"

New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations.  Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices.  Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe Red Bluff Gas Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  The Red Bluff Gas Plant provides hot work permit training to all plant employees.  Copies of issued work permits are maintained in Operations and Maintenance for a period of 1 year following completion of work.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Red Bluff Gas Plant periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovations, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job, (2) have received and understood the training required and carry a training document card while on location, (3) follow the safety rules of the location including the safe work practices, (4) advise the plant of any unique hazards presented by the contractor, and (5) notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in the process area.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Red Bluff Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
