      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\nEquistar Chemicals, LP\nCorpus Christi Complex\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\nThe Corpus Christi Complex maintains a full time, dedicated emergency response team.  If a release occurs, Refinery Terminal Fire Company (RTFC) and Equistar personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Equistar Corpus Christi Complex uses liquefied petroleum gas and raw materials to produce ethylene plus principal co-products of propylene, benzene and butadiene.  The Corpus Christi Complex is situated on a 1,600 acre site located 12 miles west of downtown Corpus Christi.\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA using tables and equations has been employed by Equistar to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from mixed C4 gas storage in the 1,3-butadiene manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of 1,517,959 pounds of mixed C4 gasses.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity part"

Five-year Accident History\nThe Corpus Christi Complex has an excellent operating history.  During the preceding five years, there have been no fires, explosions or releases, which have significantly impacted  the plant's employees, surrounding public or the environment.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\nEquistar's written emergency response plan deals with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  Emergency response planning is coordinated with the Nueces County LEPC, the Refinery Terminal Fire Company, local law enforcement, the Corpus Christi Fire Department and area hospitals.   In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n \nThe Corpus Christi Complex has implemented an emergency equipment inspection, testing and maintenance program which ensures that emergency response equipment will operate properly when needed.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.\n\nEquistar is presently working jointly with the Nueces County LEPC to increase public awareness and communication in the event of a chemical release.  This includes a public education effort undertaken along with other Corpus Christi industries as well as improved radio communications to promote rapid dissemination of information."
