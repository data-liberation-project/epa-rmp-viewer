The branch located in St. Louis is located within a short distance of the Home Office.  G.S. Robins has specialized in serving the unique chemical needs of the Midwest.  The Lombard branch is involved with chemical storage and transportation.  Employees at the branch location work with the chemical containers, but do not open any of the containers.\n\nG.S. Robins and Company is a long time member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD).  Through the NACD G.S. Robins has committed and pledged to constantly improve the management and handling of chemicals by following the \"Responsible Distribution Process(RDP)\".  RDP is a system that promotes continuous improvement in the health, safety, and environmental performance of all member companies.  G.S. Robin's implementation of the RDP includes a commitment to comply with relevant environmental health and safety regulations.  The senior management at G.S. Robins has formally accepted these guiding principles.\n\nRDP includes guiding principles for all aspects of environmental health and safety.  These include:  communication with emergency response officials, operating our facilities in a safe manner, respond to community concerns about chemicals, and to make health, safety and the environment a priority.   In order to verify that G.S. Robins has complied with the guidling principles of RDP, the NACD conducts a third party verification.  The on-site verification is conducted by a third party.  The third party audits G.S. Robins every three years.\n\nThe primary activities at the Lombard branch consist of the following:  drum and tote storage, material loading and unloading, and transporation.  The Lombard facility of G.S. Robins has four of the 140 chemicals identified by the EPA above the threshold quantity.  These chemicals are:  chlorine, formaldehyde, hydrofluo"

Formaldehyde is stored on-site in three different types of containers.  These containers are:  2,500 lb. tote, 500 lb. drum, and 4 gallon containers.  The worst-case scenario demonstrates all of the formaldehyde on-site being released at one time.  The maximum amount on-site is 15,000 lbs.  The scenario would be either a fire or explosion causing a complete release of all material at one time.  The scenario has an offsite impact radius of 4.6 miles(estimated distance to Toxic Endpoint).  The modeling was done using the EPA COMP program.  The likelihood of this scenario taking place is remote.  The formaldehyde is stored inside the warehouse building.  G.S. Robins does not have the maximum amount of inventory on-site at all times.  Currently, G.S. Robins and Company is investigating methods to reduce the amount of inventory on hand.\n\nThe alternative scenarios at G.S. Robins-Decatur consist of problems that are more likely to happen.  As a chemical distributor, we move a large quantity of chemicals.  During the moving ro storage of a chemical, there is always the chance that a container could begin leaking.  The leaking could be caused by several factors.  There factors include:  overfilling, jostling during transporation, or just a leak.  G.S. Robins employees are all trained on safe material handling and how to properly handle spills and leaks.  All chemicals reported are stored in the outdoor chemical storage area.  The following are the alternative scenarios at G.S. Robins-Decatur.  These alternative scenarios were completed on the EPA COMP modeling program.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS FOR INDOOR/WAREHOUSE CHEMICAL STORAGE\nAll scenarios below were based on being released in an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air.\nThe Alternative Scenarios represent incidents that are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.
