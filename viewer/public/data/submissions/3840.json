We sell anhydrous ammonia to farmers by way of farm tanks filled at our 10000 gallon storage tank. We have installed the Tripod Breakaway on all filler hoses, installed a remote shut off valve from storage tank to fill station. If we should have a pipe or hose rupture , it should be a minor release. We use locks on valves when not in use.\nWe have never had an accident. We have sit down and talk training sessions on safety before we start an unusual job. We've had film sessions on safety, and try to always put safety first.\nWe only have three homes with in range to be affected by a worst case. They have all been alerted to the danger from a cloud of ammonia.   We have consulted with our Emergency Release Coordinator in our county. For several years we have been reporting in the Tier II Program to Texas Dept. of Health , and Floyd County LEPC."
