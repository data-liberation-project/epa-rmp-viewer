Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, and neighbors.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Promix Fractionator is owned by K/D/S Promix, LLC.  Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) became the operator of the plant.\n\nAt the facility, the plant receives natural gas liquids (NGL) as feedstock from natural gas processing facilities.  The incoming plant feed is fed directly into the plant by pipeline with any excess feed being diverted by pipeline to the underground storage caverns located nearby.  When the quantity of feed supply from the process gas plants is insufficient, supplemental feedstock from the underground storage caverns are returned back to the plant feed system (by pipeline) as feedstock.  This feedstock is treated (for removal of CO2) prior to entering the fractionation process.  This is accomplished by an Amine system, which uses a Diethanolamaine and Methyldie"

The purity products are stored either in tanks or underground storage caverns (by pipeline).  These products are distributed to various customers via pipeline, barge or transport trucks.  Chlorine is the only regulated toxic substance on site.  The previously listed chemicals are flammable substances regulated under the RMP.  The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of the RMP is to provide information about our operations, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case of an accidental release, our five-year accident history and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nWe have analyzed and performed the simulated \"Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\" for both the toxic substance and the flammable substances.  Details of these models are within the reporting of the RMP that is being filed with the EPA.  All distant calculations were based on the EPA's RMP*Comp (Version 1.7) and the EPA OCA methods, which are known to over predict the impact potential release from such scenarios.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and manage their consequences, no credit for any control or mitigation measures were taken into account when evaluating the alternative release scenarios.\n\nWe have discussed these potential releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in the Assumption Parish, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Promix Fractionator has been operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administrat"

Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last five years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n* Hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the process area, which will sound an alarm in the control room upon detection of elevated hydrocarbon concentrations.\n* Chlorine gas detectors around the process area.\n* Fire Water system consisting of fire extinguishers, fire monitors and firewater deluge system for fire fighting purposes.\n* Emergency Shutdown (ESD) systems have been installed and recently upgraded for the entire plant.  ESD pull switches are located at various locations within the facility in order to safely shutdown the facility during an actual emergency.  An electrical ESD has been added which shuts off the entire electrical supply to the facility.  \n* Burner management system has been installed in order to provide a safe air purge of furnaces during emergency shutdown of the heaters.\n* Continuous pilots on the flare in order to ensure uninterrupted combustion of vented hydrocarbon gases\n* Truck drivers entering the facility to load/unload are required to chock wheels and to attach grounding cables prior to loading/unloading.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, pro-active approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our Process Safety Management Systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - \"PSSR\"\n*"

Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe Promix Fractionator is owned by K/D/S/ Promix, LLC.  Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) became the operator of the plant.\r\n\r\nAt the facility, the plant receives natural gas liquids (NGL) as feedstock from natural gas processing facilities.  The incoming plant feed is fed directly into the plant by pipeline with any excess feed being diverted by pipeline to the underground storage caverns located nearby.  When the quantity of feed supply from the process gas plants is insufficient, supplemental feedstock from the underground storage caverns are returned back to the plant feed system (by pipeline) as feedstock.  This feedstock is treated (for removal of CO2) prior to entering the fractionation process.  This is accomplished by an Amine system, which uses a Diethanolamaine and Methyldiethanolamine mixture to remove the CO2.  \r\n\r\nThe facility has a capability to fractionate the feedstock into six product streams:\r\n\r\n\tPurity Ethane\r\nEthane/Propane (E-P) Mix\r\n\tPropane\r\n\tIso-Butane\r\n\tNormal Butane\r\n\tNatural Gasoline\r\n\r\nThese product streams are further purified to remove contaminants such as water and mercaptans.  The purity products are stored either in tanks or underground storage caverns (by pipeline).  These products are distributed to various customers via pipeline, barge or transport trucks.  Chlorine is the only regulated toxic substance on site.  The previously listed chemicals are flammable substances regulated under the RMP.  The fac"

The purpose of the RMP is to provide information about our operations, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case of an accidental release, our five-year accident history and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nWe have analyzed and performed the simulated \"Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\" for both the toxic substance and the flammable substances.  Details of these models are within the reporting of the RMP that is being filed with the EPA.  All distant calculations were based on the EPA's RMP*Comp (Version 1.7) and the EPA OCA methods, which are known to over predict the impact potential release from such scenarios.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and manage their consequences, no credit for any control or mitigation measures were taken into account when evaluating the alternative release scenarios.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed these potential releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in the Assumption Parish, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Promix Fractionator has been operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program since 1992.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last five years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n* Hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the process area, which will sound an alarm in the control room upon detection of elevated hydrocarbon concentrations.\r\n* Chlorine gas d"

ESD pull switches are located at various locations within the facility in order to safely shutdown the facility during an actual emergency.  An electrical ESD has been added which shuts off the entire electrical supply to the facility.  \r\n* Burner management system has been installed in order to provide a safe air purge of furnaces during emergency shutdown of the heaters.\r\n* Continuous pilots on the flare in order to ensure uninterrupted combustion of vented hydrocarbon gases\r\n* Truck drivers entering the facility to load/unload are required to chock wheels and to attach grounding cables prior to loading/unloading.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nWe take a systematic, pro-active approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our Process Safety Management Systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\r\n\r\n* Process safety information\r\n* Process hazard analysis\r\n* Operating procedures\r\n* Training\r\n* Mechanical integrity\r\n* Management of change\r\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - \"PSSR\"\r\n* Compliance audits\r\n* Incident investigation\r\n* Employee participation\r\n* Hot work permit\r\n* Contractors\r\n\r\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have a multitude of programs in which our employees participate.  We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come unde"
