      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nNewington Energy - Newington, NH \n\nThe Newington Energy Power Project (NEL) is a 525 MW gas fired combined cycle power plant located at 99 Old Dover Road in Newington, NH.  The project lies approximately 1000 feet from the Piscataqua River in a mixed zone area.  The NEL Facility is to be owned and operated as a merchant power facility using state-of-the-art technology and environmental controls that provide extremely high operational efficiency and low air emissions.  Through the use of natural gas and low sulfur number 2 distillate, as a backup fuel the facility will generate enough power to supply of 700,000 homes in New England.  \n\nSystem Overview\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system provides storage, vaporization, transfer, and injection control facilities for the ammonia gas to support the selective catalytic reduction system (SCR) in the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The application of Selective Catalytic NOx Reduction Technology (the process) reduces nitrogen oxide air emissions from the station.  There are two HRSG's in the plant and are designated as train 1 and 2.  Each HRSG will have its own dedicated anhydrous ammonia system and the system description below pertains to the train 1 design and operation.  The train 2 system design and operation will be identical to train 1.\n\nThe ammonia system consists of a pressurized storage vessel supplied with a 100% directly heated vaporizer, one ammonia dilution air and injection control skid for the HRSG(s) which includes two-100% dilution air blowers and heaters; ammonia/air mixer and the associated injection/balancing skid of the HRSG.  The SCR is used to reduce the emissions level of nitrogen oxides (NOx) generated from the operation of the gas turbine generator (GTG), and of the duct burners in the HRSG.  Ammonia is injected into the exhaust gas stream at the proper temperature section in the HRSG that contain the SCR catalyst modules and converts the NOx into nitrogen and water before dischar"

The storage vessel is size to provide approximately 2.5 days of continuous supply of ammonia at the design usage rate of 144 lb/hr for NOx reduction to 9 ppmv based on a 24-hour per day operation of fuel oil at -10\u00b0F in the GTG.  When the GTG is firing with fuel gas, the vessel has approximately 7 days of storage.  The vessel is mechanically rated for 265 psig and 170 \u00b0F.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is supplied by tanker truck through a liquid filled connection.  This connection is supported by a bulkhead containment wall designed to withstand the force arising from a tanker truck pulling away while still connected.  An emergency shut-off valve is also provided at both the liquid filled and vapor returned line to allow quick shut-off of liquid and vapor flow in the event that there is an accidental pull-away of a truck or a hose rupture.  Ammonia is stored in a liquid state in equilibrium with its vapor at saturation conditions in a pressurized vessel.  The vessel is maintained at approximately 100 psig and 64 \u00b0F by an electric vaporizer under drum pressure control via a PID loop controller modulating the heat input to the ammonia vaporizer.  \n\nAmmonia Storage Vessel\n\nThe ammonia storage vessel temperature is monitored through the local indicator.  The level in the vessel is monitored through the local gauge, and remotely through the DCS.  A local level indicator and a local horn for high level alarm are also provided at the truck unloading station.  The ammonia tank pressure is indicated through a local gauge and remotely through the DCS .  A high pressure switch will shut-off the vaporizer if the drum pressure increases to 165 psig.

In general terms, the RMP protects the health and safety of environment and the community and PSM protects the on-site employees.  \n\nItems that are addressed in the RMP/PSM:\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan (the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP)) has been developed to address a broad spectrum of emergency scenarios and contingent responses.  The use of a single emergency response plan per facility will eliminate confusion for facility first responders who often must decide which of their plans is applicable to a particular emergency.  The \"ICP\" is designed to yield a highly functional document for use in varied emergency situations while providing a mechanism for complying with multiple agency requirements.
