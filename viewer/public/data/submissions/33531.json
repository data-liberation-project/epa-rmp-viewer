      "SummaryText": "The Farmers Coop Elevator (Clonmel) is an agricultural retail business which serves crop producers in the area.  This facility adheres to all local state and federal rules and regulations.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Sedgwick County Fire Department will be our first responder.  They are notified annually through our Tier Two submissions, as part of the Community-right to-Know regulations.\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia plant consists of 1- 12,000 gallon tank (52,428#).  The bulk of our business is selling fertilizer to our crop producers who raise wheat, milo and beans.  This facility may also have up to 30 - 1,000 gallon tanks that could hold up to 131,070 pounds when filled to 85% capacity.  The total capacity would be 183,498#.\n\nThe worst case scenario and the alternate scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to the Homeland Security Act.  All relevant information will be forwarded to the local first responders.  \n\nOur employees are trained on a rotational 2-year basis where they attend a state sponsored anhydrous ammonia school.  The receive classroom training as well as a written test.  \n\nOur facility is maintained in accordance with the Kansas Department of Agriculture requirements.  Our company realizes that the KDA has not adopted the most recent ANSI standard.  When the newer version is adopted, our company will budget the time and funds needed to insure that all facilities meet the new standards.   \n\nOur Emergency Action Plan is shared with the County Fire Department. By definition we do not have an Emergency Response Plan because we require all employees to evacuate the area and call 911 immediately in the event of an accident or release of NH3.\n\nThe Farmers Coop Elevator Company has not experienced an injury or a reportable release in the last five years.\n\nThere are no are no known repairs or upgrades needed or required at this time."
