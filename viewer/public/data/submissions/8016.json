The same properties that make these chemicals so valuable in wastewater treatment also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them.  Safe handling procedures prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to our own personal health and our co-workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n    This wastewater treatment facility is a small facility, designed for 6 million gallons per day, with 2 wastewater-holding ponds and is located at 735 Cotten Road.  The primary purpose of this facility is to treat wastewater from Berwick, Patterson, Bayou Vista and Sewerage District No. 2 of St. Mary Parish.  The water is pumped into the facility through underground pipe.  The wastewater is aerated and mixed in the first basin and then enters a settling process in the second basin.  From this basin chlorine is added to the wastewater to kill any bacteria that is present.  Then sulfur dioxide is added to the wastewater stream to reduce the amount of chlorine in the water to a no chlorine limit.  The water is fully discharged into the Intracoastal Waterway.\n    The maximum amount of chemical that this facility keeps is four- (4) - 1 ton containers of chlorine and four- (4) - 1 ton containers of sulfur dioxide.  Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are regulated substances.\n    The worst case release scenario of chlorine or sulfur dioxide is the total failure of one of the 1 ton cylinders resulting in an"

      "FacilityID": 8016,
      "SummaryText": " immediate release of 2000 pounds of chlorine.  Due to the fact that the cylinders are constructed, tested and inspected under strict guidelines and routinely replaced by the chemical supplier, it is very unlikely that this will ever occur.\n    The distance to the endpoint of the lower toxicity limit for the worst case scenario of chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 1.3 miles.  The model used to arrive at this distance was the EPA's RMP Comp program.\nThe alternate release scenario involves a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the 5/16\" diameter valve body opening.  It consists of a total release of 2000 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide over a 60-minute duration.  The distance to the endpoint of the lower toxicity limit for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.  The model used to arrive at this distance was also the EPA's RMP Comp program.\n    This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  All employees undergo training in the emergency procedures associated with chlorine.  This facility had no reportable release of chlorine in the past five years.  This facility's emergency response plan is coordinated with the St. Mary Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  In the case of an emergency the facility's employees are trained to contact the local fire department who will coordinate any necessary actions that need to take place."
