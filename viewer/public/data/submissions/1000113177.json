We use a combination of safety programs, accidental release prevention programs, and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\r\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\r\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule; and\r\n- An overview of our emergency response program.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\r\n\r\nOur facility uses Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) to produce Sodium Hydrosulfite for use in the clay, textile, and pulp and paper industries. The EPA has identified SO2 as having the potential to cause adverse offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of SO2.  We are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\r\n\r\nChemical Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nAt the Chemtrade Logistics Leeds Plant we take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\n- Process safety information;\r\n- Process hazard analysis;\r\n- Operating procedures;\r\n- Training;\r\n- Mechanical integrity;\r\n- Management of change;\r\n- Pre-st"

Our company and our employees are committed to maintaining these management systems and recognize that this is the way we do business.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThere have been no RMP-level releases of SO2 in the past five years at our facility.  We have a system in place to investigate and keep records of significant incidents, including accidental chemical releases that might occur at our facility.  If a significant release should occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Planning:\r\n\r\nWe maintain emergency response plans, which address all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Our plan also includes specific procedures for responding to a release of SO2.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Chester County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Chester County Emergency Management Agency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of improvements we have made to hel"
