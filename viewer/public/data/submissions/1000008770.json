The plant is designed to treat an average daily flow of 4.4 million gallons per day with instantaneous hydraulic peaks of 11 MGD. The CCRWWTF operates as a single-state trickling filter treatment plant. The treatment process consists of screening, grit removal, primary clarification, trickling filtration, secondary clarification, chlorination, and land application of the effluent. Solids are handled by anaerobic digestion and air-drying.\n\nAfter water has been delivered to the homes, industries and commercial establishments of a city, it is used for a multitude of purposes and is eventually wastes to a sewer system. This wastewater contains an enormous variety of waste products of human, animal, vegetable, and mineral origin. Some of the waste products will be dissolved in the water and some will be suspended. There are three different types of suspended sewage solidsA?those that settle, those that float, and those that are so small that they neither settle nor float, but remain suspended in the water. It is the last of these, sometimes called A?colloidal solids,A? which make settled sewage look cloudy.\n\nNormally, sewage contains in excess of 99.9 percent water and less than 0.1 percent solids. It is far more difficult to remove the solids than it was to add them in the beginning. It is this difficult job of removal of solids, which is one of the primary purposes of this sewage treatment plant.\n\nThe wastewater enters the plant from the sewer colle"

The flow is then pumped into two primary clarifiers where the heavier settable solids are removed.\n\nAfter this A?primary treatmentA?, the flow is pumped to the two 100-foot diameter trickling filters. The trickling filters accomplish biological degradation in the secondary treatment process. The flow from the trickling filter is collected and either recycled through the plant again or sent to the two final clarifiers. IN the final clarifiers, the trickling filter sloughing and others solids are removed and recycled through the plant again.\n\nAfter the final clarifiers, the flow goes to the chlorine contact basin. The chlorine contact basin provides disinfecting with chlorine to destroy potential pathogenic organisms. The final effluent water is pumped to a land application site where it is used to grow a variety of animal feed grasses.\n\nThe solids removed in the primary clarifiers are pumped to the anaerobic digesters. In the digesters, the organic matter is decomposed via anaerobic bacteria. After digestion, the sludge is placed in drying beds for solar/air drying. Once the sludge is dried it is disposed of under the guidance of 40 CFR 503 regulations."
