The program includes engineering, education, and enforcement provisions for hazard communication, spill prevention and response, hazardous waste, universal waste and waste oil management, wastewater and storm water management.\n\n2. Emergency Response Program: America's Heartland Packing has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency action plan. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting. The Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment. The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies. The facility has communicated the hazard of ammonia with the local fire department and LEPC.\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance: America's Heartland Packing is a processing plant located at 28100 Heartland Drive, Wright City, MO. The building houses a processing plant used for beef slaughter and processing. The processed products require refrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used. There is one Machinery Room located on the east side of the plant.\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the process.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents during the past five years. However, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, lists of action items were developed. The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished. Monthly Safety training is conducted for all employees at this facility, in additio"
