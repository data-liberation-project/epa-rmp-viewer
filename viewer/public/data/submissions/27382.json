All applicable laws and regulations of the State of Nebraska are adhered to.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, one with a capacity of 30,000 gallons, and the other with a capacity of 18,000 gallons.  The storage tanks, as many as 26 anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks each with a capacity of 1,000 gallons, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  Total storage capacity at this facility is 323,306 lbs of Ammonia, including the nurse tanks.  The facility is manned during the season and is operational through normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as worst-case release and alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of one vessel is released as a gas in 3 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a pressure relief valve failure.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the largest tank, releasing the entire 131,070 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The off site consequences were calculated using TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers.  The worst case scenario used EPA's recomme"

It is estimated that 486 people would be affected by this release.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed a transfer hose failed and leaks 3,563 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a D atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario.  Using urban topography and TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers the toxic endpoint is 0.46 mile.  The population with in that area is estimated to be 17 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, pressure relief valves and human intervention will stop the leak.  \n\nNehawka Farmers Cooperative has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years.  Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nNehawka Farmers Cooperative has several key elements in it's accident prevention plan:\n1. The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Nebraska as enforced by the State Fire Marshall.\n2. Annual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n3. Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4. Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5. Annual inspections by Nebraska State Fire Marshall's inspectors include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n6. Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.
