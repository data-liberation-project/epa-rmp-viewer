As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible. To accomplish this elements have been organized in a way that is consistent with the corporate organization, how frequently different elements are accessed, and who needs to refer to the program.  The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location.   \n1.    THE  MADERA POWER, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Madera Power has updated their unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Madera Power business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n2.    DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nMadera Power injects anhydrous ammonia into the fluid bed combustor to provide for simultaneous control of hydrocarbons, NOx and SOx emissions, and to handle varied fuel heating characteristics. \nAmmonia gas is piped from a storage tank through a control valve (which is controlled by the NOx emmissions), where it mixes with force air in a duct.  The air-ammonia mixture is injected into the boiler flue gas.\n3.    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia system at"

      "SummaryText": " the  Madera Power facility is an integral part of the overall business.   The system contains a maximum total charge of approximately 60,000 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.  Madera Power has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of this analysis are reported in the body of the program.\n\nOur personnel monitor the ammonia system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.\n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in pre-season safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n4.    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nMadera Power has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n5.    EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, ?Emergency Action Plans.?  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, ?Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,? and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond ?minimally? to a release.  Under this plan we will call emergency personel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and the Madera County Fire Department and the Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of a"

Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Madera Power continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Madera Power business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Madera Power now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a ?living document?.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Madera Power employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Madera Power will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
