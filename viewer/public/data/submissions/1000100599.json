Currently there are no planned changes necessary to improve facility safety.  \r\nDead River has never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  In the event of an emergency involving the Auburn facility's propane system, it is Dead River's policy to notify the Auburn Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency.  Dead River also has a trained fire brigade. We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our propane system and conducted a joint exercise with us. \r\nThe EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities is organized into 9 Sections.   Since this facility only has flammable and no toxic chemicals covered under 40 CFR 68, and because it is a Program 3 Propane Storage facility with no history of accidents, several of the sections do not apply."

It is Dead River's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is Dead River's policy to notify the Auburn Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Dead River maintains a First Response Vehicle at its Hampden, ME location that is for use at any location during emergencies.  Dead River has an outreach program to offer summer propane fire training burns and instructional training to local fire departments for the purpose of educating fire departments about the hazards of propane. \r\nThe Auburn facility is a rail-access bulk terminal storing propane (LPG) for resale to retail propane outlets. The facility consists of eight 30,000-gallon tanks with a total storage capacity of 204,000 gallons at maximum fill level (85%) as well as 5 railcars (30,000 gallons each) that can be attached to the unloading system for a total propane capacity of 331,500 gallons. \r\nThe worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a 30,000-gallon when filled to the greatest extent allowed (88%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite 0.4 miles, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. The alternative release scenario is a break in a 3 diameter pipe, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite 0.08 miles, and no residences are within the distance to the endpoint.\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and other applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state laws and rules (Maine Fuel Board).   Protective measures include but are not limited to security fencing, redundant emergency valves on all inlet and o"
