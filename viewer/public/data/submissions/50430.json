He can be contacted at 269-637-8474 (main).\n\n\n2. Stationary Source Information and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe South Haven facility, which is owned and operated by Albemarle, is located at 1421 Kalamazoo Street, South Haven, Michigan (Van Buren County).  Employing approximately 120 staff, the South Haven facility manufactures specialty organic chemicals, most of which are sold in bulk form to the pharmaceutical industry. \n\nThe South Haven facility currently has two processes covered in the risk management program.  One process is program level 3, and one process is program level 1.  The two covered processes contain three regulated substances, which are used as raw materials in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.  The covered processes and their regulated substances are summarized below:\n\n- Process #1: On-site storage and handling of compressed gas cylinders containing methyl chloride and hydrogen chloride.  The risk management program rule regulates these substances as toxics.  The maximum expected inventory of these materials is 12,000 and 14,000 pounds, respectively.  Process #1 is a RMP program level 3 process.\n\n- Process #2: On-site storage and handling of isopropylamine, stored as a liquid in 55-gallon drums.  The risk management program rule regulates this substance as a flammable.  The maximum expected inventory of isopropylamine is 18,000 pounds.  Process #2 is a RMP program level 1 process.\n\n\n3. Worst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nIn estimating the worst-case scenarios, EPA requires that the entire contents of the largest storage vessel will be released without the aid of active mitigation systems and safe work practices.  This is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked.  In addition to the worst-case release scenario, alternate re"

Alternate release scenarios may consider any active or passive mitigation measures associated with the covered process.\n\nAlbemarle referred to the OCA guidance manual and U.S. Census software to estimate the impacts of worst-case release and alternate release scenarios for the regulated substances. The RMP rule requires that the following release scenarios be reported:\n\n- Hydrogen chloride: Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\n- Methyl chloride: Alternative release scenario only. Since methyl chloride and hydrogen chloride are in the same process and the worst-case release distance to endpoint for methyl chloride is within that for hydrogen chloride, a worst-case release scenario is not required to be reported for methyl chloride.\n\n- Isopropylamine: Worst-case release scenario only. Since the isopropylamine process is RMP program level 1, an alternative release scenario is not needed.  \n\nThe following paragraphs summarize the results of the worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.\n\n*Hydrogen Chloride Worst-Case Scenario\n\nUsing EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations, the distance to endpoint for a worst-case hydrogen chloride gas release without any mitigation is 1.1 miles.  The distance to endpoint calculations are based on a released amount of a full 600-lb cylinder at a rate of 60 pounds per minute for ten minutes.  Public receptors are located within the distance to endpoint of this worst-case release scenario.\n\n*Hydrogen Chloride Alternative Release Scenario\n\nUsing EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations, the distance to endpoint for an alternate release scenario (ARS) for a hydrogen chloride gas leak is 0.3 miles.  The distance to endpoint calculations are based on an assumed failure of the cylinder plug and subsequent vapor release from a full cylinder.

HazMat Training to the Awareness Level;\n4. Hazard Communication/Right-to-Know;\n5. Respiratory Training; and\n6. Operation and use of Fire Extinguishers.\n\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAlbemarle has not had any reportable accidental releases in the last five years as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, General Guidance for Risk Management Programs. \n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Emergency Action and Response Plan (ERP) provides specific procedures that shall be implemented when the emergency siren is activated due to a chemical release, spill, fire, explosion, or run-away reaction.  While the prevention of a site emergency is Albemarle's goal, it is also recognized that employees must have adequate training to enable them to respond appropriately in the event a site emergency occurs.  \n\nPlanning for a site emergency is a continuous process, starting with prevention and including preparedness, and response.  Albemarle takes seriously its civic responsibility and tries diligently to comply with all requirements\n\nTo help maintain an effective ERP, Albemarle has established and seeks to maintain a productive working relationship with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department. Also, Albemarle regularly trains employees and keeps several up-to-date copies of the ERP in areas accessible to all personnel.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAlbemarle believes in emphasizing environmental and safety training. We will continue to assess the environmental impact of each of our processes and propose to design, build, operate and maintain our operations so they remain safe and acceptable to local communities and are protective of the environment."

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (Albemarle) has always acknowledged its responsibility to provide its employees with a safe working environment and to be a responsible corporate citizen to the surrounding community.  Albemarle strives to meet or exceed applicable EPA and OSHA rules and regulations.  As part of this commitment, Albemarle periodically evaluates the quality of its environmental and safety programs.\n\nAlbemarle applies risk management by using a multi-layered approach for protective systems.  Minimization of risk due to process incidents is achieved by the independence of the layers of protection employed and the unlikelihood of simultaneous failure of several such layers.  The following is the order of the protection-layered system:\n\n1. Basic Process Control\n2. Engineered Shut Down Systems\n3. Active Release Protection (scrubber, sprinkler system)\n4. Passive Release Protection (dikes, barriers)\n5. Plant Emergency Response\n6. Response from Outside Authorities\n\nThe protective layer concept places initial reliance on the process operation itself followed as needed by various layers of protective systems.  These protective layers include engineered process shutdown systems, followed by release controlling systems.\nShould the inner layers of safety protection fail to prevent or sufficiently mitigate the incident's effect, both on-site and off-site, then emergency response protection layers may be necessary.  \n\nThe facility's accident prevention and emergency response procedures have been designed for successful risk management and is a blend of sound organizational practices that prevent or mitigate incidents including operating procedures, employee training, preventative maintenance, management of change, process hazard analysis, any other human factor components.  \n\nAlbemarle has integrated its emergency response procedures with those of the South Haven Fire Department and the Van Buren County Emerge"
