The nearest major intersection is Morrell Street and Cedar Crest Boulivard approximately 1 mile Northwest of the facility.\n\nThe facility recycles by-products from the beef, poultry, and pork processing industries.  In addition, the facility recycles by-products from butchers, grocers and restaurants.  The finished products include tallow, meat and bone meal, and yellow grease.  Finished products are stored in aboveground tanks and silos.   The plant operates 24 hours/day, six days a week from Monday to Saturday.\n\nOdorous air emissions from the processing of the above mentioned by-products are captured, delivered, and treated through a wet scrubbing system at the facility.  The system uses chlorine as an oxidant to destroy the organics that are odor producing.  The system consists of the following basic parts: (a) chlorine storage and feed system with associated piping and valves; (b) sodium hydroxide storage and feed system with associated piping and valves; and (c) packed bed wet scrubbers."
