The facility receives natural gas by pipeline, separates natural gas condensate, processes and stores natural gas liquids (NGL) and compresses the residue gas for sale.  Walsh Production, Inc. has an on-going commitment to safety and accident prevention.  \n\nAlthough the plant is not manned by full-time, onsite personnel, critical process parameters are monitored and emergency shutdown (ESD) are enacted automatically, if necessary.  Plant personnel are trained to respond to remote alarm conditions and are notified via a call-out system in the event of process faults.  Various automatic process safeguards and interlocks are intended to preclude a release.  If a release should occur, these systems allow an immediate remote response from trained operators as well as alerting other personnel to the need for an onsite response.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Wiggins Gas Plant is located just north of Interstate-70 approximately 4 miles east of Wiggins, Colorado.  Walsh personnel visit the facility approximately every other day, for monitoring; routine maintenance is typically performed on weekends.  \n\nThe Wiggins Gas Plant consists of a single process to remove NGL from up to 3.5 MMscf/day of raw gas per day using Propac units and the plant produces up to 5,000 gallons/day of NGL, although more recently, 1,700 gallons per day is typical.  The NGL are a flammable mixture consisting of several regulated flammable substances including methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane.  Included with the regulated flammables are additional non-regulated flammables in the C-6 through C-8 range.  The flammable gas mixture is stored near the south end of the facility in pressure vessels at ambient temperatures and at approximately 120 "

There are no regulated toxic materials.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nEmployee Participation:  All employees are trained on accident prevention and emergency response as part of their formal training.  An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared that identifies specific employee responsibilities and responses, and lists the reporting requirements, names, and telephone numbers for key company personnel.  Employees are expected to participate in the Emergency Response Program.    \n\nDesign Codes and Standards:  The facility was constructed in 1997 in accordance with appropriate design standards and code requirements including, where appropriate, ASTM, ASME, API, and NEC. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  An initial hazard review has been performed by facility and consultant personnel to identify major hazards that might be encountered.  This hazard identification includes the following potential items: fire, explosion, over pressurization, corrosion, overfilling, equipment failure, and loss of plant utilities.  Following the initial hazard review, periodic updates at least every 5 years and after any major process change, unplanned event, or release will be conducted.\n\nVarious process controls are in place to regulate the process and prevent any unplanned events.  The process equipment includes various vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, equipment interlocks, level monitors, and flow meters to maintain normal control.  There are lower explosive limit detectors and fire eye sensors in the process and compression areas, both of these are tied into the ESD system.  There is an onsite flare for emergency vapor release only.  Unexpected excess vapor can be relieved through safety relief valves.  Alarm systems continuously monitor the process.  The monitoring information can be accessed on-site, with operational status information available remotely.  Emergencies and shut down conditions are re"

This provision is intended to prevent a liquid release from impacting the nearby Bijou Canal.  The dike capacity is sufficient to contain all liquids contained within the three pressure vessels; a complete release from the largest vessel would cover the 28,741 square-foot containment area to a depth of approximately one inch providing a large surface area to maximize dissipation and evaporation.  The pressurized storage tanks and ancillary piping have pressure relief valves, but there are no area release monitoring or detection systems other than the unit and tank process alarms from equipment failure, high level, high temperature, or high pressure.  \n\nOperator Training: Operators have written instructions for normal operations and emergency responses.  These instructions include normal and emergency startup and shutdown, as well as a variety of special procedures for restarting and adjusting various components of the process.  Training is verified by a combination of documented experience, observational methods and verbal testing.  \n\nContractors:   The facility uses various contractors for major plant modifications as well as for certain scheduled preventative and unscheduled maintenance.  Contractors are provided a site safety briefing at the start of any new work, and contractors performing continuing services are required to provide documentation of training to facility personnel.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Internal compliance audits are not part of the typical operation of the facility.  Outside audits are performed by regulatory agencies, including Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and Walsh facilitates and participates in these audits as requested.\n\nIncident Investigation:  Incidents (involving a catastrophic release) will be documented and investigated.

This ERP includes specific actions for a variety of personnel, ranging from first responder to senior management.  There is a comprehensive list of names and telephone numbers in the ERP for key Walsh personnel and Wiggins Plant emergency responders.  The primary response agency is the Morgan County Fire Department.  In addition, the emergency response program is also coordinated with the Morgan County emergency management agency and Designated Response Authority (DERA) in Fort Morgan, Colorado.
