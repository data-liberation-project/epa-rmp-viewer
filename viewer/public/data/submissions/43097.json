In this capacity, Coyne is a re-seller of pre-packaged chemicals to industrial, commercial and municipal customers.  Of the current inventory consisting of 200 types of chemicals, two are considered extremely hazardous and are stored above threshold values making them subject to RMP regulations.  The facility is located on 8.393 acres within the Edgely Industrial Park and is bordered by railsiding to the North, a marsh on the East, another marsh and State Road to the South and Gilbreth International to the West.\n\nThe two chemicals on site subject to RMP regulations are: \n\nChlorine (CAS # 7782-50-5)\nSulfur Dioxide (CAS # 7746-09-5)  \n\nChlorine is contained within cylinders containing 150 lbs. of product.  Sulfur Dioxide cylinders contain 100 lbs. of product.   All full cylinders are stored inside the warehouse in storage racks with 19 cylinders per rack.  There have been no off-site releases of these items within the last 10 years.  The worst-case scenerio for Chlorine is a release of the entire contents of one 150 lbs. cylinder in 10 minutes resulting from a broken valve.  This scenerio has an end point of 3/10 mile.  Due to the fact that that this item is stored and transported in storage racks designed to house this type of cylinder, the worst case scenerio is not likely to occur.  An alternate worst-case scenerio for either Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide is a small leak from the valve or packing nut of a cylinder releasing 150 lbs. of Chlorine or 100 lbs. of Sulfur Dioxide over a period of one hour with an endpoint of 1/10 mile.  Mitigation for either scenerio includes applying a cylinder \"A\" Kit or placing the leaking cylinder into a containment vessel located on-site.  Coyne Chemical has an in-house Emergency Response Team trained to handle this type of emergency.  In addition to the above actions, a "
