This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)    To save lives.\n2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)    To protect the environment.\n4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\nAmericold maintains an emergency response (safety) committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Americold Plant #75101 (Gateway) facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is cond"

Three minor injuries were treated at the scene. No hospitalization was necessary.\n\nOn July 21, 2006 the facility experienced an accidental 66 pound release of ammonia from a faulty valve on a refrigeration unit on the dock. As a precaution 3 employees were evaluated by medical personnel and released. Other facility personnel were moved to a safe location in another part of the facility. No damage to the off-site environment was reported nor was any off-site evacuation or shelter in place necessary. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Americold Plant #75101 (Gateway) has an "

All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\nDuring the RMP Development Review, it was recommended that the facility continue to conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures.  In addition, it was recommended that the facility encourage the local Fire Department to participate in the evacuation drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nDuring the review of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the Process Hazard Analysis study generated mitigation measures that would improve safety at the Americold Plant #75101 (Gateway) facility located at 6150 Xavier Dr. in Atlanta, GA.  These action items were entered into a management plan and have been implemented.\n"
