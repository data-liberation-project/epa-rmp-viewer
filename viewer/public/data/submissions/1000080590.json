Bulk and packaged products are received via transport trucks and stored for the eventual sale to farmers. This is a new facility that has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process. Because it is a new facility, there have been no accidents in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nB.     Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program\n\nThis facility strives to meet or exceed compliance with state anhydrous ammonia regulations. Training is provided for each new hire and re-hire employee and also and at least every three years as required by OSHA. The anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks and associated equipment are inspected in order to comply with DOT & PHMSA requirements. \n\n\n\nC.    Emergency Response Policies and Programs\n\n\n\nEach employee is trained to be familiar with the emergency action policies and procedures through safety reviews and other safety meetings. This facility has an Emergency Plan which covers accidental releases, natural disasters, security incidents and other emergency response practices and procedures. The Emergency Plan for this facility is reviewed and updated on an annual basis as part of a comprehensive review process. The Emergency Plan for this facility includes specific instructions for the employees regarding the response procedures to an emergency. The procedures provided in the Emergency Plan are shared with all employees and followed in the event of an emergency. The local emergency planning committee and fire department personnel are provided copies of Tier II reports for this facility and invited for a tour on a regular basis.

      "SummaryText": "ummary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n\n\nE.    Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBecause this is a new facility, it has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its employees as a result of the RMP covered process. In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of anhydrous ammonia with off-site consequences as a part of this staging process. Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain this record.\n\n\n\nF.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nManagement of this company and facility continuously look for ways to enhance the safety of this location. There is no process at this facility and no real way to enhance safety as it is just a holding facility for nurse tanks each sized 1,000 gallons (4,664 lbs) or less.  We will continually look at ways to enhance safety of this facility.\n\n\n\nG.    Summary\n\n\n\nThe employees of this company are extremely proud of our safety record and vast improvements made in both environmental stewardship and safety. We believe with our programs and policies in place and with the continued efforts of our personnel, we will maintain our safety record and our safe facility environment for the public, our customers and our employees for years to come.\n\n"
