      "SummaryText": "Country Star Co-op Inc. - Gardner\n\nCountry Star Co-op is a farmer owned business serving Crawford and surrounding counties.  We are committed to the safety and well being of our employees, community and the environment.  Through regular safety training in areas such as hazard awareness, daily operating guidelines, and worker protection Country Star employees have minimized any potential risk of a hazardous release due to human error.  If an accident were to occur, our emergency response policies would take effect to ensure the proper calls were made and emergency response crews would respond in a timely manner.\n The facility is equiped to handle fertilizer, crop protection products, retail fuel, and also has a grain facility.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a fertilizer used by area farmers as the most economical source of nitrogen used to grow crops.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous stored at the facility is 25,500 gallons or 160,000 pounds in a single rail car.\n\nCountry Star Co-op has never had a release of Anhydrous from a storage tank that ever caused any deaths, injuries, or property damage to the facility or the environment.\n\nA written Emergency Response plan that complies with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 has been implemented and is retrained annually.  New hires will receive training as part of their new employee orientation.  State and local authorities are provided with all pertinent information so that emergency planning and community right-to-know information can be obtained and used, this is known as SARA Title III.\n\nIt is the policy of Country Star to remain proactive in accident prevention and to minimize any potential loss in the event of a release.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  State and local agencies will continue to conduct yearly inspections and repair requirements.  Through regular maintenance, and routine inspections we will continue to run a safe business."
