The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The \ncontrol of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the \nfacility.\n\t\n\tTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a \nPlant Safety Program. The objectives of this program are to achieve maximum efficiency and \nsafety performance.\n\t\n\tOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and \nimplementation of accidental release prevention and emergency programs which are designed to \ncomply with OSHA's  Process Safety Management  standard ( 29 CFR 1910.119 )  and EPA's  \nRisk Management Program ( 40 CFR  Part 68).\n\t\n\tThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent \nthe occurrence , and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as \nwell as fires, explosions , and other types of catastrophic events.\n\t\n\t\n\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n                This company operates a food production facility at this location. The facility operates one \n                ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of \n                ammonia ( CAS #7662-41-7 ) contained in the system  is in excess of 10,000 pounds. Since an \n                ammonia release from the system  could pose a risk of offsite public impact, and the system is \n                regulated  under the OSHA  PSM standard , the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements  \n                of the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\n                In the ammonia refrigeration system, ammonia vapor is fed from vessels at low pres"

The compressed vapors from the low stage compressors are fed to vessels \n                operating at intermediate pressures and then fed to the high stage compressors. The high pressure\n                ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to the condensers where heat is removed, \n                turning the vapor into a high pressure liquid. The high pressure liquid from the condensers is \n                collected in a high pressure receiver.\n\n                The high pressure liquid collected in the high pressure receiver is circulated to various  \n                pressure  vessels , where it is pumped to the evaporators ( storage tanks, freezers, air handling \n                units, etc. ) located throughout the plant. The ammonia liquid absorbs heat at these various \n                evaporators, changing from a liquid to a vapor. The low pressure ammonia vapor is then sent \n                back to the appropriate vessel via vapor headers.\n\n             \n\tSummary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\t \n\tThe worst-case release scenario at the facility is a release of pressurized liquid ammonia from the \n\t60 inch  by 14 foot High Pressure Receiver located in the Ammonia Machinery Room. The \nReceiver has a capacity of 10,000 pounds of ammonia. However, the plant has administrative \ncontrols in place that limit the ammonia inventory in that receiver to a maximum of 40% of the \ncapacity. Therefore the worst - case release would involve the release of 4142 pounds of \nammonia over a ten minute period due to the failure of the receiver. The ammonia could travel \n0.99 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\t\n\tThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\t\n\n\tIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture of this receiver. \n\tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.\n\tPressure safety relief valves limit operating pressures in this rece"
