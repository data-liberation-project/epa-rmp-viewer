      "SummaryText": "Dart Container Corporation (formerly Solo Cup Company), located at 1550 Wrightsboro Road in Augusta, Georgia, manufactures disposable food containers including those consisting of polystyrene foam.  This foam production process uses Difluoroethane (CAS # 75-37-6).\n\n\n\nDart Container is dedicated to the safety of our employees and our community.  Our corporate safety policy reinforces Dart's commitment to providing a safe environment for our employees and our neighboring community.\n\n\n\nThe Dart Container plant in Augusta, Georgia occupies 350,000 square feet of space on a 15 acre lot.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario listed depicts the release of 45,642 lbs. of diflouroethane based on a rupture of a full tank.  RMP Comp software was used to model this release.  There is potential for offsite impact.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario depicts a 2 hour release of diflouroethane from a ruptured delivery pipe. The estimated release would be 4,200 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program includes coordination with local emergency response teams.  Our Emergency Response Plan includes notification procedures, emergency contacts, etc.  Employees are trained on emergency response annually.\n\n\n\nSafety training at Dart Container Corporation Augusta is an ongoing process.  Safety review and evaluation is part of our company's day to day operations and we are committed to a program of continuous improvement.\n\n\n\n"
