      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThis document represents the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the City of Lawton, Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) at Lawton, Oklahoma.  After all Program elements described throughout this document are implemented, the City of Lawton, WWTP will be in compliance with current RMP regulations for the management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe City of Lawton operates a WWTP that uses chlorine gas in the tertiary treatment process and is stored inside and outside of the Chlorine Building, out of direct sunlight, with overhead protection.  The chlorine gas is contained in 1-ton cylinders (2000lb) of which there is at most 12 full cylinders on hand.  Because the WWTP does not meet the criteria for the Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910 .119) it becomes mandatory to manage the process under Program 2 requirements of the Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.\n\nThe City of Lawton, WWTP uses sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas to actively remove the chlorine gas from the treated water prior to discharging as effluent into 9 mile creek.  The SO2 used for this process is stored on wedges in the SO2 Room and on the ground out of direct sunlight outside the SO2 Building with overhead protection.  Under the current operations of the WWTP, there are at most 14 full 1-ton cylinders of SO2 at the site. \n\nChlorine gas at the City of Lawton, WWTP is fed directly from four (4) 1-ton containers.  Under normal operations, two (2) cylinders are attached to the chlorination system for back up or potential use and two (2) cylinders are attached to the chlorination system at the same time for actual use.  As a result, the maximum potential chlorine inventory at this plant is 12, 1-ton cylinders or 24,000 lbs of chlorine gas.\n\nThe four (4) cylinders attached to the chlorination system are maintained at a constant temperature between 60 and 80 degrees F by a heating and ventilation system.  The temperature of the chlorination are"

In order to allow for this case, all chlorine gas cylinders are equipped with fusible plugs designed to relieve extremes in pressure caused by elevated temperatures.\n\nSO2 gas at the City of Lawton, WWTP is fed directly from four (4) 1-ton containers.  Under normal operations, two (2) cylinders are attached to the SO2 system for back up or potential use and two (2) cylinders are attached to the SO2 system at the same time for actual use.  As a result, the maximum potential SO2 inventory at this plant is 14, 1-ton cylinders or 28,000 lbs of SO2 gas.\n\nThe four (4) cylinders attached to the SO2 system are maintained at a constant temperature between 60 and 80 degrees F by a heating and ventilation system.  The temperature of the SO2 area should never reach the critical temperature for SO2 gas (290 degrees F).  However, at these temperatures SO2 will only exist in the gaseous phase.  In order to allow for this case, all SO2 gas cylinders are equipped with fusible plugs designed to relieve extremes in pressure caused by elevated temperatures.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAccording to the RMP guidelines, a worst case scenario would involve a rupture of a full 1-ton (2000 pound) cylinder of chlorine or SO2 with a release time of 10 minutes.  The entire contents of the cylinder would be evacuated with a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  As a result of the pressure of the released gas, the building fails and all 2000 pounds of gas are released into the environment.  Using the data provided above, the air dispersion modeling software calculated a total plume distance for the worst-case scenario of 3.5 miles.  \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nDispersion modeling was also performed to estimate the effective areas for at least one alternative release scenario for each regulated substance in a regulated process.

The WWTP Superintendent plans classroom training for all personnel and periodically reviews training records to ensure that all employees receive the required training. The City of Lawton, WWTP encourages employee participation and input in maintaining a safe work environment through an Employee Participation Plan.\n\nINITIAL TRAINING\n\nThe City of Lawton, WWTP Chlorine and SO2 Manuals will be used as the primary guidance during initial training.  They emphasize health and safety hazards associated with the chemicals, operating procedures, and relevant safe work practices.  Initial training for new operators will include both classroom and on-the-job (i.e., hands-on) training.  New employees to the WWTP are shown the process of maintenance and equipment testing by trained personnel using demonstration and hands-on methods.  City of Lawton, WWTP maintenance personnel perform on-site maintenance and equipment testing on all chlorination/Sulfanation equipment.  All personnel are instructed that repairs are replacements in kind, where only the same manufacturer's equipment is used and no retrofitting occurs.\nAll current operations and maintenance personnel receive initial RMProgram training.

At a minimum refresher training is provided to operators and maintenance personnel every 3 years.  All information covered in initial training is included in refresher training with additional emphasis placed on current operating procedures and safety information and a review of the City of Lawton, WWTP Emergency Preparedness Plan.  Maintenance personnel will be given additional training specific to maintaining Chlorine/SO2  equipment.   \n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe policy of City of Lawton, WWTP is to involve its employees in the development and implementation of the EPA RMProgram elements at the process and storage areas which are subject to risk management regulations.  The City of Lawton, WWTP Employee Participation Plan addresses involving employees in PHAs and other process safety management program elements, communicating employees right-to-access RMP information, and documenting employee participation.  The City of Lawton, WWTP communicates the following information to all operations/ maintenance personnel:\n\n-Content of the RMP and requirement for employee participation.\n\n-Employees' right to access PHAs and all process safety management information required to safely perform their duties.\n\n-Procedures for obtaining access to this information.\n\nThe environmental Compliance Official for the WWTP has overall responsibility for maintaining and implementing this procedure.\n\nEMPLOYEE ACCESS TO RMPROGRAM\n\nThe City of Lawton, WWTP and contract employees oper"

Employees verbally request access to this information through the WWTP Superintendent, who provides timely access to approved requests during normal working hours.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nThe City of Lawton, WWTP will perform audits to self evaluate the design and effectiveness of its RMProgram and compliance with EPA RMP regulations.  Whenever necessary, recommendations will be developed from the audit to address program deficiencies.  Compliance audits must be performed at least every 3 years at the regulated process areas at the City of Lawton, WWTP.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nAn incident investigation ensures that all incidents at the City of Lawton, WWTP that resulted in or could have reasonably resulted in a release of chlorine or SO2  are promptly investigated (within 48 hours).  The purpose of the incident investigation procedure is to identify the underlying causes of an incident and to implement corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.
