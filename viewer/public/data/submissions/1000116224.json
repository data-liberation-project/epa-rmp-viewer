The West Seminole RCF Plant identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of the Baker Engineering & Risk Consultants, Inc. of\nSan Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow methodology for RMP radius of exposure for a 1-psi overpressure. According to the analyses, the maximum end point for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 724 feet (0.14 miles) from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained in the Propane Refrigeration Accumulator when filled to the greatest amount allowed (80% at 60 degrees F). Since the plant is located in a sparsely populated area, this worst-case release would not affect any public or environmental receptor beyond property owned and occupied by Occidental Permian.\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the Executive Summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifies that,"

This commitment is demonstrated by the investment of significant resources in accident prevention, such as personnel training, mechanical inspection, process control systems and by recognition of safety as a primary factor in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. However, if an accidental release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, the West Seminole RCF plant achieves control of hazardous materials by:\n-A commitment to OSHA's PSM standards, EPA's RMP, DOT's Pipeline Safety and Texas Railroad Commission Rule 36 Hydrogen sulfide safety regulations which promote and require adherence to process safety activities designed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nDevelopment and use of Occidental Permian and West Seminole RCF Plant safety, operating, maintenance, emergency response, engineering design and construction policies, procedures and practices designed to prevent accidents and potential releases.\n\n-Knowledge of and adherence to applicable industry recognized standards, specifications and recommended practices that address and provide guidance for the proper design, construction and operation of facilities containing hazardous materials.\n\n-A comprehensive equipment inspection and testing program.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe West Seminole RCF Plant, operates a variety of processes, some of which produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas and natural gas liquids) from an inlet gas stream which is principally carbon dioxide. The plant processes regulated flam"

The West Seminole RCF Plant adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years, the West Seminole RCF Plant has had no accidental release that caused off site impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  Within the past 5 years the plant has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or sheltering in place. There was one evacuation due to an unlit flare incident. This is referenced in the 5-year accident history section of the RMP.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe West Seminole RCF Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is involved.  The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as\nnecessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other"
