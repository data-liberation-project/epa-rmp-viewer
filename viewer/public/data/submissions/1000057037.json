Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed.  Sysco Denver, Inc. has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n4. 5-Year Accident History:\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents during the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Plan:\r\nSysco Denver, Inc. is included in the written community emergency response plan.  This facility has its own emergency action plan.  The emergency action plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release.  The emergency response plan includes information on emergency health care.\r\nThe local agency coordinating the facility emergency response plan is the Belfor Environmental, which has the phone number: 800-930-0011.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nWe at Sysco Denver are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Belfor Environmental, who provides our emergency response services.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 25,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\n\r\nOur facility keeps comprehensive Process Safety Information (PSI) documentation on the ammonia process at the Sysco Denver facility. This PSI assists the employee operators and outside contractors in understanding the ammonia process so they can operate and maintain the refrigeration system in a safe effic"
