The company's primary business is to repackage, custom-blend and distribute products for the water disinfection, pharmaceutical, food, computer and other industries.\n\nHawkins has prepared and filed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for its Peotone, Illinois facility where its primary activity is to receive and distribute packaged products such as chlorine for use by individual customer facilities.\n\nThe RMP that Hawkins has filed for this facility is a planning and prevention tool, it helps us to better identify hazards and communicate with others.  Risk Management Plans are developed by facilities that have sufficient quantities of any 140 hazardous materials on site; at this facility, we handle only one of those materials.  In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that 150,000 Risk Management Plans have been submitted since the original June 1999 due date.\n\nThe products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility is chlorine.  Chlorine and bleach (sodium hypochlorite) are well-known and trusted disinfectants for drinking water, waste water, food processing equipment, swimming pools, etc.\n\nRisk Management\nHawkins provides products critical to meeting the regions' public health and the manufacturing needs.
