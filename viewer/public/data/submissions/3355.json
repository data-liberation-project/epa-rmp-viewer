The company operates one factory located in Bay County, Michigan, one of the largest sugar beet processing factories in the United States.  Additional information about the Monitor Sugar Company and a description of the sugar production process can be found on our website at www.monitorsugar.com.\n\nThe employees at Monitor Sugar developed the following Safety Mission Statement:\n\nMonitor Sugar Company is committed to providing every employee with a safe and healthful place in which to work.  Accident elimination is good for everyone because accidents produce both social and economic loss.  Only by everyone working together can we achieve an injury free workplace.  \n\nManagement will provide direction, time, tools, and training regarding safe work practices.  Each employee is accountable for his or her own safety and the safety of co-workers.\n\nA safety team consisting of management and union members provides an avenue for the communication of safety topics/information/issues.\n\n\nMonitor Sugar's Environmental Policy states:\n\nTo meet environmental challenges, our activities will support and enhance sound environmental practices.  In managing our business, Monitor Sugar Company will strive to:\n\n( Comply with all environmental laws and regulations.\n\n( Integrate environmental protection considerations into Company planning and decision making.\n\n( Ensure proper handling and disposal of all wastes, and take steps to minimize their generation while seeking opportunities to recycle wastes and use recycled materials.\n\n( Work with appropriate en"

Approximately 1 pound of sulfur dioxide was released.  There was no off-site impact.\n\nMonitor Sugar took data for its offsite consequence analysis for sulfur dioxide from the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\"  (EPA publication 550-B-98-010).  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario assumes that the entire content of a single one-ton cylinder is released over a period of 10 minutes.  Such a release would result in an offsite impact.\n\nThe likelihood of this type of release is extremely low and Monitor Sugar has not had this type of catastrophic release in its history.  The sulfur dioxide cylinders are safely stored in a designated area, away from high traffic operations.  Employees are trained in the hazards associated with sulfur dioxide and the proper handling of the cylinders.  These procedures reduce the possibility of a cylinder being damaged, resulting in a release.\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumes that a small hole develops in a pipe containing sulfur dioxide vapor.  The estimated release rate is 4 pounds per minute for 30 minutes.  This alternate release scenario may result in an offsite release.  While the likelihood of the alterna"
