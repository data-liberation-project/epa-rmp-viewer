During this tour a review of our system and changes are addressed with them.  The HAZMAT team drills on a regular basis and drills are critiqued. Deficiencies are reviewed and corrective action taken.\nTo ensure continuous improvement, the environment, health and safety function has increased staff resources.  We have contracted with a consultant to assist us in revalidation of PHA's and to conduct compliance audits.   We continuously review industry practices and benchmark for applicable best practices to improve our ammonia system to make it safer for our stakeholders and the communities in which we have presence.\nThe refrigeration system has been redesigned and will be on line in spring 2006 with improved operating and safety systems.  A PHA has been completed for this new system and changes to the initial design have been implemented based on the PHA.  To ensure safety during this construction period, only an approved contractor is being utilized, pre job planning is performed, training will be conducted for operators, and improved safety systems have been designed into the upgraded system."
