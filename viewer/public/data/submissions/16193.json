Solar Gas Inc. identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of the Wilfred Baker Engineering Company of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow methodology for determining the RMP designated 1-psi overpressure contour.  According to the analyses, the greatest maximum end point for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 400 feet from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained in the Propane storage bullet when filled to the greatest amount allowed (246,415 pounds).  This worst-case release would not affect any public or environmental receptor beyond property owned and occupied by Solar Gas Inc. \n\nWithin the past five years, Solar Gas Inc. has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the executive summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.  \n\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the informati"

The facility consists of an underground storage cavern, associated surface equipment for product treating and transfer, and an office.  The facility contains a regulated flammable i.e., commercial propane.  Unodorized Propane is received by railcar and pumped into the cavern.  Propane sold by Solar Gas is odorized with Ethyl Mercaptan prior to loading into tank trucks and railcars for industrial and residential consumption primarily in North Dakota and Minnesota.  The Ethyl Mercaptan is below the listed RMP threshold quantities.  All of the Propane to be stored arrives by rail; most outbound shipments are by transport trucks.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcesses at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Solar Gas Inc. adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years, Solar Gas Inc. has had no accidental release that caused off site impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  Within the past 5 years the facility has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nSolar Gas Inc. maintains a written emergency action program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures f"

The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility.  \n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nSolar Gas Inc. identified potential candidates for worst case scenarios and utilized the services of the Wilfred Baker Engineering Company of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow methodology for determining the RMP desgnated 1- psi overpressure contour.
