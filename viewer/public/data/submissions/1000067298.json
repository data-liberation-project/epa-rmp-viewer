(SI Group) continuing commitment to minimize the potential impact from our facility on our workers, our community neighbors, or the environment.  It is the stated policy of Addivant to safely manage our site operations.  In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur.  The Morgantown, West Virginia facility is a certified Responsible Care facility.  Responsible Care is a technical standard for management of Environmental, Health, Safety and Security risks associated with our operations.  \r\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.  If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plans, please contact our Environmental Health, Safety and Security Manager at (304) 284-2214.\r\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical production facilities everywhere we do business.  Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.\r\nIn order to provide top quality products for our customers, the SI Group Morgantown facility utilizes certain raw materials in its manufacturing processes that are classified as toxic or flammable.  We are committed to comply with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain a safe operation.  Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.  However, if a major release does occur, our trained on-site emergency response team will be activate"

The facilities are referred to as the North Plant and the South Plant.  Both plants were built in 1965 and currently employ about 120 people in the Morgantown area.  Addivant manufactures millions of pounds of antioxidant chemicals marketed under trade names such as ULTRANOX(R), WESTON(R), and others.  Our products are used in various plastics, inks, coatings, and adhesives for improved ultraviolet (UV) heat, color, and processing stability.\r\nThis site is also home to a Technology Center, where SI Group conducts advanced research in specialty chemical technology.\r\n4.0  Hazard Assessment Results\r\nAs part of our risk management planning, we have specifically identified the type of event that, should it ever occur, would have the most negative impacts on our workers and our neighbors.  This is known as the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS).  As defined by EPA, we are required to assume that the numerous engineering and administrative safety controls we have in place to prevent or mitigate such accidents have all failed at once.  EPA defines a worst-case scenario as a catastrophic failure, which is an event that essentially results in the instantaneous release of the contents in the largest single vessel on-site of a regulated RMP chemical.\r\nA worst-case and alternative release scenario were developed for the North and South Plants using the RMP Comp software and ALOHA software.  The scenarios predicted the endpoint for each release scenario based upon the data input.\r\n5.0  General Accidental Release Prevention/Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nSI Group has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM is an integral part of working safety at both the facilities.  PSM ensu"
