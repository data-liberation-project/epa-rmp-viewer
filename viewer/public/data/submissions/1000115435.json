The personal safety of each employee of this company is of primary importance.  To the greatest degree possible, management will provide all mechanical and physical facilities required for personal safety.  Our objective is the safety program reducing our exposure to accidents to the absolute minimum.\n\nSafety Audits are done at our facilities to insure compliance with all regulations and safety practices.\n\nOUR GOAL IS ZERO ACCIDENTS AND ZERO INJURIES.\nThrough a cooperative effort by each employee, we will attain our goal.\n\nWe recognize the responsibilities for safety are shared:\n\n1.  The employer accepts responsibility for leadership of the safety program, for its effectiveness, and safeguards providing a safe work place.\n\n2.  Employees are responsible for wholehearted cooperation of the safety program, including compliance with all rules, and practicing safety while performing their duties.\n\nEmployees are very actively involved in the safety program.  Western has monthly safety meetings for all employees.  The evacuation plan is practiced regularly.  \n\nOur policy is SAFETY FIRST.  The personal safety of each employee of this company is of primary importance.\n\nB.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Western facility is located at 37091 Highway 30 in Geismar, LA.  The facility transfills acetylene gas into trailers that each hold approximately 225 cylinders.  The cylinders are connected through a common manifold header.  The amount of acetylene in an entire trailer is less than 6,800 pounds.   Several trailers could be present at the location at any time. The facility receives"

When full, the trailer is disconnected from the manifold and sent to other Western facilities.\n\nC. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nWestern complies with the EPA RMP regulations, OSHA PSM regulations and NFPA 55 guidelines. \n\nWestern takes pride in having done it right the first time before an accident or incident would require any form of additional safety measures.  This facility has multiple gas monitors throughout the production areas and fire detectors.  The monitors are set to alarm at 10 % of the lower explosive limit (LEL). \n\nD. The five year accident history:\n\nThe five year accident history covers only certain releases (\u00a768.42(a)):\n\n1) The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n2) The release must have caused at least one of the following:\na) On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\nb) Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nA review of the facility\u0092s accident history showed that there have been no releases in the last five years that met the criteria above.\n\nE.  The emergency response program:\n\nCoordination of Emergency Response for this facility consists of tours taken by the Geismar Volunteer Fire Department and Local EMS system.  Western invites the local Fire Department to our facility as part of their training program to familiarize them with our facility and products.  These tours and training received count as required hours the Fire Department members to remain certified. \n\nAll Western personnel also receive training on emergency response.  Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually or whenever a change in process would occur.  Monthly safety meetings are held for"
