This committment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Anshutz Ranch East Gas Plant, located near Evanston, Wyoming, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, including natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensates from the produced well stream.  In addition, the plant operates a variety of refrigeration and support processes which use methane and propane as the refrigerant.  The Anshutz Ranch East Gas Plant has several regulated flammables from methane through pentane.  These compounds may be present in both hydrocarbon mixtures and as essentially pure compounds.  \r\n\r\nAll of the covered processes in the facility are designated as \"Program 1\" under the Risk Managment Plan and handled accordingly. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the ARE Gas Plant.  The ARE Gas Plant was recently reclassified from RMP Program 3 to Program 1 because no public receptors could be identified within any calculated radius of exposure.  Because processes at the gas plant are regulated by the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program and are also subject to OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation \r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prev"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant\u00bfs PSM and accidental release prevention programs.  These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include plant safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain sake operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazard, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Up-to-date process safety information is maintained on a going basis.  The reference documents are readily available at the plant location.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information in supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous tech"

This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating if equipment.  This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  OSHA and the EPA recognize the analysis as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to company\u00bfs local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in responses to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each fi"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\r\n\r\n1.Unit startup\r\n2.Normal operations\r\n3.Temporary operations\r\n4.Emergency shutdown\r\n5.Normal shutdown\r\n6.Initial startup of a new process\r\n\r\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pump and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:\r\n\r\n1.Conducting training\r\n2.Developing written procedures\r\n3.Performing inspections and tests\r\n4.Correcting identified deficiencies\r\n5.Applying quality assurance measures\r\n\r\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on:\r\n\r\n1.Overview of the process\r\n2.Safety and health hazards\r\n3.Applicable maintenance procedures\r\n4.Emergency response plans\r\n5.Applicable safe work practices \r\n\r\nThese help to ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Equipment manufacturer\u00bfs written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed in accordance with the manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or place temporary safeguards in place to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integr"

This helps to ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practice\r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes to be properly review and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to:\r\n\r\n1.Ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\r\n2.Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change\r\n\r\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u00bfs findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that th"

      "SummaryText": "e reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the ARE Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are scheduled at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are forwarded to the ARE Gas Plant management for resolution.  The plant management initiates any corrective actions taken in response to the audit and tracks them until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant experienced NO reportable accidents in the past 5 years.  Releases that did occur at the plant involving regulated substances, were quickly contained and resulted in no deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as nece"

The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response plan for the ARE Gas Plant is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The LEPC is responsible for preparing the community\u00bfs emergency response plan. The ARE Gas Plant is included in the county\u00bfs emergency response plan under response to oil fire, gas plants, and substations. The ARE Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe ARE Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned over the next few years in response to PHAs, PSM/RMP audits, and incident investigation findings:\r\n\r\n1. Confirmation of PSV design and capabilities\r\n2. Vessel and mechanical integrity inspection updates\r\n3. Updates to action item closure system"
