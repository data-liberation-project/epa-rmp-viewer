This committment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Anshutz Ranch East Gas Plant, located near Evanston, Wyoming, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, including natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensates from the produced well stream.  In addition, the plant operates a variety of refrigeration and support processes which use methane and propane as the refrigerant.  The Anshutz Ranch East Gas Plant has several regulated flammables from methane through pentane.  These compounds may be present in both hydrocarbon mixtures and as essentially pure compounds.  \n\n\n\nAll of the covered processes in the facility are designated as \"Program 1\" under the Risk Managment Plan and handled accordingly. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the ARE Gas Plant.  The ARE Gas Plant was recently reclassified from RMP Program 3 to Program 1 because no public receptors could be identified within any calculated radius of exposure.  Because processes at the gas plant are regulated by the EPA?s Risk Management Program and are also subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\n\n\nThe ARE Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prev"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant?s PSM and accidental release prevention programs.  These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include plant safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe ARE Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain sake operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazard, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Up-to-date process safety information is maintained on a going basis.  The reference documents are readily available at the plant location.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information in supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous tech"

This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating if equipment.  This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe ARE Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nThe ARE Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  OSHA and the EPA recognize the analysis as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to company?s local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in responses to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each fi"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe ARE Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n\n\n1.Unit startup\n\n2.Normal operations\n\n3.Temporary operations\n\n4.Emergency shutdown\n\n5.Normal shutdown\n\n6.Initial startup of a new process\n\n\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.
