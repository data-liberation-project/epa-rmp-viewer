      "SummaryText": "Clemens Food Group uses anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) in its refrigeration systems; ammonia is a regulated substance as listed in 40 CFR Part 68 [Table 1 to ? 68.130]. Clemens has developed this Risk Management Program (RMP) Plan to document completion of the RMP requirements. Clemens has developed the worst-case and alternative release scenarios described in the rules and determined areas which could be impacted. Because a worst-case release could have offsite consequences and Clemens is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements, the facility is subject to the Program 3 Requirements under the RMP.  Clemens has adopted an Emergency Action Plan, included as Appendix 1, which outlines its internal procedures for responding to spills and releases, notification requirements, and coordination with the local emergency response organizations in the event of an ammonia release that cannot be contained and has the potential to have offsite impacts. Clemens has been actively involved in emergency response planning. They have worked with the local emergency management agency to coordinate offsite response activities. "
