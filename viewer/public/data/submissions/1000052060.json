The SIC code for the operation is 2026; the NAICS code is 311511.  The facility has approximately 265 full time employees and operates 24-hours/day, 7-day/week, 52-weeks/year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The refrigeration system inventory at the facility exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.\n\n\n\nThe facility has evaluated and reported one worst case scenario and has evaluated alternate scenarios and reported one which will result in an offsite impact that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced an accidental release of ammonia during the previous five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  This serves as the prevention plan required by RMP.  Qualified outside cont"

The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\n\n\nThe system is monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is inspected periodically for proper operation daily.  The refrigeration control continuously monitors system conditions and has alarms and provisions for communicating with refrigeration staff 24-hours a day.  Walking inspections are conducted daily.  System operating parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with an early detection system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room and refrigerated spaces.  The system has an emergency shutdown station located outside the engine room.\n\n\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic incident response drills.  The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or off-site injuries, or offsite evacuation or sheltering in place.

The facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the SERC, LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.  The facility's Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  A release of 100 pounds or more must be reported to the National Response Center, the SERC, and LEPC, in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA.  The Fire Department will be provided with a copy of the facility's Emergency Action Plan upon request.\n\n"
