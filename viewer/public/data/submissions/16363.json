Chlorine is utilized to disinfect the finished water prior to pumping. Chlorine is stored in the chlorine room in ton cylinders. Safety equipment includes a leak detector, self-contained air packs and an emergency repair kit for ton cylinders. \n\n7 Worst Case Scenario The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios as required by the EPA. The worst case scenario was developed using EPA's RMP.COMP VER 1.06. The worst case scenario assumes the rupture of a ton container at the facility. This would mean the release of 110 lb./min.  Passive-mitigating circumstances would be an enclosed process, which would partially contain any leak and limit the area affected. EPA mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec was used. Using the EPA atmospheric conditions and mandated meteorological conditions an end point for chlorine contamination has been determined to be 2.2 miles. The estimated residential population affected would be 1100 people or 400 households. \n\n7 The Alternative scenario This scenario also uses RMP.COMP.VER 1.06. The alternate scenario is defined as a more likely scenario. This involves tube failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the 5/16 inch diameter valve body opening. Passive mitigating circumstances would be an enclosed process, which would partially contain the leak and reduce the area affected. EPA mandated meteorological conditions were used namely stability factor of D and a wind speed of 3 m/sec. The m"

Using the EPA atmospheric conditions and mandated meteorological conditions an end point for chlorine contamination has been determined to be .1 mile and would affect the population of 10 people.\n\n7 Five Year Accidental History  Lake Howard Filter Plant has had no accidental releases of any regulated chemicals for the previous five year.\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Accidental Release Response Program The accidental response program for the Lake Howard Filter Plant falls under the jurisdiction of the (SEOP) Sylacauga Emergency Operating Procedure. The SEOP is a coordinated effort between the Utilities Board and local authorities to contain and control any accidental release of chlorine. Local authorities includes the following:\n\n1. Fire Dept.\n2. Police Dept.\n3. Coosa Valley Rescue Squad\n4. Emergency Medical Services \n\nUnder the accidental release response program, standard procedures have been established to alert the local authorities should a serious leak occur. Evacuation of the affected areas will be implemented while designated personnel control and contain leaks. The Police dept. and Fire Dept will be responsible for public notification and evacuation. \n\n7 The accidental release prevention program is based on the following elements:\n\n1. High level of training for the operators\n2. Preventive maintenance programs\n3. Use of safety equipment\n4. Use of operating procedures\n5. Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n6. Auditing and inspections programs.\n\n7 Planned Changes to improve Safety \n\nThe Sylacauga Utilities Board is in the process of installing a SCADA system capable of giving remote alarms should a chlorine leak be detected."
