This facility conforms to the laws and regulations of the state of Iowa.  Our emergency response policy involves the evacuation of employees and response activities according to the emergency response plan for our community.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has no anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  There may be as many as 13 nurse tanks parked at this facility. If they are all full they will have a maximum storage capacity of 82,515 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The facility operates with normal business hours during the spring and fall season and expects to have most tanks parked here in the off season.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case\" release and \"alternative\" release scenarios.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the tank releasing the entire 6,350 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The off site consequences were calculated using \"TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers\".  The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an \"F\" atmospheric stability class.  A rural topography was selected as typical.  The distance to the endpoint is .46 miles.  It is estimated that 831 people would be affected by this release. \n\nThe \"alternative release\" scenario assumed a hose breaks and leaks 2,900 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA "

      "SummaryText": "recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmospheric stability class in this scenario.  Using rural topography and \"TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers\" the toxic endpoint is .10 mile.  The population with in that area is estimated to be 131 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.  \n\nCameron Coop has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years.  Even though the company does not anticipate any releases it still will coordinate annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nCameron Coop has several key elements in their accident prevention plan:\n1. The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Iowa.\n2. Annual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n3. Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4. Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5. Annual inspections include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n6. Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safety to the operators and to the community."
