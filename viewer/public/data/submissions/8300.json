This RMP is designed to communicate compliance requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, Section 112(r), and implementing regulations, which are codified in Part 68, Volume 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68).   These regulations require water treatment plants that inventory more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine to prepare RMPs.  This RMP was prepared to meet the requirements for submission of RMPs to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, and the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (JCLEPC) by the required deadline of June 21, 1999.\n\nThe City is required to complete the following to meet the RMP requirements by June 21, 1999:  \n\n1.  Management System - Designate  responsible individual(s) or position(s) with responsibility for RMP implementation.\n\n2.  Hazard Assessment - Assess the potential impact of worst-case and alternate scenarios, and prepare a 5-year accident history.  \n\n3.  Prevention Program - Prepare a program that addresses the regulatory requirements for an EPA Program 2 Prevention Program.\n\n4.  Emergency Response Program - Coordinate with local emergency responders in the event of an accidental release of chlorine at the AWTP.\n\n5.  Risk Management Plan Review and Submittal - Obtain comments from all interested parties and prepare the final RMP, and submit it to EPA and the JCLEPC by the due date.\n\nThe City of Arvada has addressed and completed all of the requirements for the RMP.\n\nThe City of Arvada is committed to protecting public health and safety.  The preparation of this analysis and the RMPs reflect that concern. The RWTP was constructed in 1959, and has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past forty years that have resulted in off-site consequences, death, injury, or environmental damage.  The AWTP was ac"

The City has made the decision to investigate other methods of water disinfection, and is in the process of reviewing three options:  \n\n     1.  Utilization of sodium hypochlorite (liquid bleach solution).\n\n     2.  Installing an active mitigation system (scrubber) for use with chlorine gas.\n\n     3.  Converting the gas chlorine process to on-site generation of chlorine dioxide.\n\nThe three options are in the design phase, and actual construction should be completed within the next two years.  For the interim period, the RMPs will assist the City in maintaining this positive safety record, as well as to comply with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\n\nCERTIFICATION STATEMENT:\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable\ninquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nPrint Name:  James M.
