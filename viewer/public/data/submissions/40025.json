DEGESCH AMERICA INC.(DAI) MANUFACTURES METAL PHOSPHIDE FUMIGANTS,PHOSTOXIN AND DEGESCH MAGTOXIN SPOT FUMIGANT. DAI ALSO IMPORTS METAL PHOSPHIDE FUMIGANTS. ALL DAI FUMIGANT PRODUCTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS RESTRICED USE PESTICIDES. ALL DAI PRODUCTS ARE IN FULL COMPLIENCE WITH ALL EPA MANDATES FOR PESTICIDE PRODUCERS. DAI MAINTAINS A CLEAN, MODERN AND EFFICENT MANUFACTURING FACILITY. DUE THE NATURE OF THE PROCESSES AND CHEMICALS USED AND PRODUCED, GOOD HOUSE KEEPING PROCEDURES AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES ARE STRICTLY ADHERED TO.THESE PROCEDURES PROMOTE A SAFE  WORK PLACE,  INSURES MINIMAL EXPOSURE RISKS TO DAI EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING OUR PRODUCTION COMPLEX.\n\n   DAI'S EMERGENCY RESPONCE POLICY IS SPECIFIC FOR EACH MANUFACTURING PROCESS AREA. THESE POLICIES INCLUDE EMPLOYEE TRAINING,  DIALOG WITH AND COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL AUGUSTA COUNTY LEPC AND FIRE DEPARTMENT.\n\nB. THE PROCESS COVERED BY THIS RMP IS THE MANUFACTUREING OF AMMONIUM CARBAMATE CAS#111-78-01. THIS PROCESS IS FULLY CONTAINED IN A 5000 SQ.FT. STEEL BUILDING. CONTAINED WITHIN IS A 3000 GAL CAPCITY TANK FOR STORAGE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA,CAS#7664-41-7  LIQUIFIED UNDER PRESURE. TANK INSTALLATION AND OPERATION IS PER 29 CFR 1910.110 STANDARDS.\nTHE TANK IS FILLED INACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 1910.111(II)(ii) 87% CAPACITY OR 13,387 LBS.\n\n       AMMONIA CARBAMATE IS MANUFACTURE FIVE (5) MONTHS PER YEAR. THE PROCESS  IS OPERATED 24 HR/DAY, FIVE (5) DAYS /WEEK. THIS PROCESS IS ELECTONICALY CONTROLLED AND PHYSICALLY MONITORED WITH VISUAL INSPECTIONS EVERY 60 MINUTES,TO INSURE PROPER OPERATIONAL PARAMITERS AND SAFETY SYSTEMS ARE FUNCTIONING. DURING THE MANUFACTUREING PROCESS OUR PHYSICAL INVENTORY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WILL FLUCTUATE BETWEEN 1000 LBS AND 13387 LBS. WHEN THE PROCESS IS NON-OPERATIONAL AMMONIA INVENTORY IS MAINTAINED AT 1500 LBS +/- 10% TO MINIMISE POTENCIAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASES.\n \nC.    NO ACCIDENTA"

THE PLANS PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL PROBLEM AREAS, ALSO FOR THE COORDINATION OF DAI PRESONNEL AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTION. THESE PLANS ALSO DEFINE LAND USE AND POTENTIAL AT RISK POPULATIONS WITH IN 1/2 MILE AND  ONE (1) MILE RADIUS OF THE FACILITY.\n\nE. 2003 YEAR END SHUT DOWN AND REVIEW DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY NEED FOR  ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE CURRENT MANUFACTURENG PROCESS EQUIPMENT OR FACILITIES."
