The Facility Policy\r\n\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of Walker Products are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  To accomplish these objectives, the Risk Management Plan incorporates programs for hazard review, hazard assessment, information on the facility and equipment, operating procedures, training, maintenance, audit for compliance, and investigation of incidents involving any damage or injuries on, or off-site.  Individual programs are reviewed and revised as needed and dependent on the conclusions of any incident investigation.  Individual programs are reviewed and revised as needed and depending on the conclusions of any incident investigation.  Should the facility undergo significant change in products or services or physical plant, programs are reviewed as to their content for the changes at the facility.\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information - ammonia storage tank is located West of Lincoln, Kansas, 1 mile West of town on U.S. Highway 18 and then 1/2 mile South.  Tank is located on the West side of the road, just South of the Farmway Coop ammonia storage tank.\r\n\r\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\r\n\r\n Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\r\n\r\n Our storage is comprised of a bulk storage tank and trailers.\r\n\r\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National"
