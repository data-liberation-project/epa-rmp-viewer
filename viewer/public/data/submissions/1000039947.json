The titanium tetrachloride is subsequently oxidized to titanium dioxide.  The Edge Moor site process also produces ferric chloride as a co-product, which is used in wastewater treatment applications.\r\n\r\nThe following RMP-covered Hazardous Materials are used at the Edge Moor site:\r\n-\tChlorine (Cl2)\r\n-\tTitanium tetrachloride (TiCl4)\r\n-\tPhosphorus TriChloride (PCl3)\r\n\r\n3.0     GENERAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nDuPont takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  DuPont was an originator of the Process Safety Management (PSM) framework, which formed the basis of the OSHA 1910.119 PSM standard in 1992 (and later the EPA's RMP standard).  \r\n\r\nEdge Moor's management systems address each of the key features of successful PSM programs, including:\r\n-\tProcess Safety Information (i.e. Process Technology)\r\n-\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n-\tOperating Procedures and Safe Work Practices (including hot work)\r\n-\tTraining and Performance\r\n-\tMechanical Integrity\r\n-\tQuality Assurance\r\n-\tManagement of Change (technology and subtle)\r\n-\tPre-startup Safety Review\r\n-\tCompliance Audits\r\n-\tIncident Investigation and Reporting\r\n-\tEmployee participation\r\n-\tContractors (safety, training and performance)\r\n-\tManagement of Change- Personnel\r\n-\tEmergency Planning and Response\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, DuPont has internal policies and standards that exceed OSHA and EPA regulations in the implementation of Process Safety Management.  We use first-and second-party audits to review performance trends, identify non-conformances with standards, and drive continuous improvement.  We have leading and lagging indicators of PSM performance, which are reviewed quarterly with top"

Edge Moor utilizes a comprehensive corrective action tracking system to manage and document actions taken to improve process safety performance.  \r\n\r\nThe Edge Moor site is also covered by DuPont's corporate standards for Management of Highly Toxic Materials (for Cl2, TiCl4, and PCl3).  These are mandatory standards covering the entire range of hazardous materials handling, including equipment design, materials of construction, supplier and customer auditing, operating and maintenance procedures, training, process controls, leak detection and mitigation, and emergency response.  These standards also provide for additional 2nd-party auditing by corporate highly toxic material experts.  \r\n\r\n4.0     FIVE- YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Edge Moor site keeps records for all chemical releases that occur at the facility.
