      "SummaryText": "1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a public generation and transmission company that provides power to almost 50 communities in Georgia.  The company owns a natural gas combined cycle combustion turbine facility at the Wansley Power Plant in Heard County, Georgia.  This facility, Wansley Unit 9, maintains a site specific accident prevention program and an emergency response plan.  The facility coordinates its emergency response plan with power plants located in close proximity.  Regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site are managed by MEAG and its facility operator.  \r\n\r\n2.\tThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nWansley Unit 9 is located south of Lowell, Georgia, close to the Northwest corner of Heard County.  Unit 9 consists of two natural gas fired combustion turbines each feeding a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG).  Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems have been installed to decrease nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions that are produced by the turbines.   Anhydrous ammonia is used in the SCR process to reduce the NOx to nitrogen and water.  Wansley Unit 9 stores liquefied anhydrous ammonia in two 15,000 gallon tanks for addition to the SCR process.  \r\nAlthough each ammonia vessel has a total capacity of 15,000 gallons, the facility Ammonia Unloading Procedure limits the tank level to 80% of capacity, or a maximum inventory in each tank of 12,000 gallons.  The total process inventory of anhydrous ammonia is therefore 121,926 lbs. of ammonia, which exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold quantity for RMP.  \r\n\r\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulation requires the classification of each process into Program Level 1, 2, or 3 in order to determine the prevention program requirements.  Since the worst case release scenario would impact a public receptor, the process"

Program 3 processes are ones that are not Program 1, but are subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, or one of the 10 NAICS codes listed in the RMP Rule.  The Wansley Unit 9 SCR process will use the PSM Program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  \r\nThe PSM Program was established in the summer of 2003 prior to facility startup.  Wansley Unit 9's PSM Program receives the full support of plant management and includes involvement of employees and contractors who work on or near the SCR process.\r\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\r\nEmployee Participation:  This program involves employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis (PHA) is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have access to the program.\r\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables employees to identify and understand the potential hazards of the system.  The written information includes the Material Safety Data Sheet for ammonia and a description of the SCR process design.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Qualified plant personnel have conducted studies, using the What-If Technique to evaluate the system and identify potential hazards.\r\nOperating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed to describe the steps that should be followed to safely operate the SCR process.  Procedures cover both normal and emergency conditions.\r\nTraining:  A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the SCR process. \r\nContractors:  All contractors are evaluated before they perform work on or near the SCR process.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure safe work practices are followed.  \r\nPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review"
