      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPool-Chem D.L.S. Enterprises, Inc. has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)  To save lives.\n2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)  To protect the environment.\n4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nPool-Chem D.L.S. Enterprises, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1977.  The process is located at 3646 South 36th Street, Phoenix, AZ 85040.  The chlorine transfer process for Pool-Chem D.L.S. Enterprises, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 20 pound cylinder. These cylinders are used off-site for the treatment of residential swimming pools. \n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on site is four one ton containers or 8,000 pounds.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nThe worst case release for this facility was that of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in the largest vessel in 10 minutes.  The largest vessel at this facility is a one ton chlorine container which holds a maximum of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  This vessel is stored outside, therefore, no passive mitigation measure"

The reference table, Exhibit 4-4, from EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (November 1998) was used to find the potential downwind distance to 3 ppm as a result of this worst case release scenario.  The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nThe alternative release was that of a 5/16 inch diameter leak from a pipeline containing liquid chlorine.  Based on the pressure in the tank, the release rate was calculated to be 72 pounds/minute.  Since there is no accident history at this facility, this release scenario was based on the possibility of a leak in the pipeline or a flange seal leak.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters/second wind speed, and D stability.  The facility is located in an urban setting.  The reference table, Exhibit 4-12, from EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (November 1998) was used to find the potential downwind distance to 3 ppm for the alternative release scenario.  This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPool-Chem D.L.S. Enterprises, Inc. has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.\n\nIn addition, the chlorine repackaging process is only operational for a minimal amount of time per day, five days per week.  While the transfer process is not in oper"

Enterprises, Inc. has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  In the event of a chlorine release at the facility, the fill operator has been instructed to secure equipment by closing all valves.  Then, the operator will evacuate area by sounding the emergency horn.  There are two switches that will activate the alarm:  at the chlorine fill station and inside the warehouse.  This horn can be heard throughout the facility.\n\nThere is an emergency contact list that includes 9-1-1 and the Phoenix Fire Department Hazardous Materials division.  In addition, there is a neighbor-call list.  The facility has worked with the Fire Department and has available for their use a B-Kit for the one-ton chlorine containers and a Self Contained Breathing Apparatus.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Hazard Analysis provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at Pool-Chem D.L.S. Enterprises, Inc.  These recommendations are expected to be  implemented by December 15, 1999.\n\nR01:\tVerify and update the neighborhood emergency telephone list once per year.\n\nR02:\tReview the operating procedures to ensure that they are an accurate representation.  Review the operating procedures annually and certify that they are accurate.  Use the operating procedures to train new employees and/or route-men\n\nR03:\tAdd \"warning\" to the operating procedures to alert operators that they need to be prepared to stop the transfer process sooner when the ambient temperature is in excess of 100  F.\n\nR04:\tAdd warning to operating procedures that Vent Valve should be closed during transfer process.  Also include instructions for how to proceed if Vent Valve is left open and liquid chlorine flows into the PVC pipeline.\n\nR05:\tConsider usi"
