The Facility Policy:\n\nThe Facility owner, management, and employees of Gavilon Ferilizer LLC are \ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local \nresponders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meetings. Additional training is conducted on various sections of the facility's Process Safety Management plan. The Facility has prepared an internal written emergency action plan which includes ammonia releases. If an accidental release should occur,the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, and other authorities to mitigate any release, and to minimize the\nimpact of a release on the population and environment.\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to manufacture and distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming industry. Ammonia is received, stored, and used in the \nproduction of liquid fertilizer solutions and is an important \nsource of Nitrogen for local agricultural crops.\n \nThe maximum quantity that can be stored at the facility is 131,300 pounds.  The  \nmethod of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing 40,000 pounds.  \nThe process is considered a batch process and operates intermittently.  \n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n   \nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards           \nInstitute \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" \nK61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2 for design, construction, and \nmaintenance of the process equipment.  The Facility also has a Process Safety Management Program that dovetails with the RMP.  It is Management's practice to minimize the amount of ammonia held or stored at the facility. The Facility continues to review and look for means to improve operation, implement Best Manageme"
