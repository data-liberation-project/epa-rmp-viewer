      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nPPG INDUSTRIES, INC. BARBERTON PLANT\r\n\r\nThe PPG Industries, Inc. facility in Barberton, Ohio, manufactures optical materials, fine chemicals and silica products.  Examples of these products include:\r\n\u00bfX\tPlastic resins - used by customers to make eyewear lenses like Transitions photochromic  lenses;\r\n\u00bfX\tChloroformates - used by customers to make medicines and chemicals used by farmers;\r\n\u00bfX\tSilicas - used by customers to flatten and thicken paints and varnishes; \r\n\u00bfX\tTeslin - a synthetic printing sheet used by our customers to make items such as menus,  identification cards, labels and children's books; and\r\n\u00bfX\tSafety films and coatings - found in commercial and military aircraft windows.\r\n\u00bfX\tOLED - Organic Light Emitting Diodes used in smart phones and TV screens.\r\nThe Optical Material process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Planning regulation. The EPA maintains a list of regulated chemicals and the threshold amounts that require them to be included in RMP. The five chemicals regulated by the EPA and used at the Barberton facility include phosgene, chlorine, allyl alcohol, ammonia and isopropyl chloroformate.  These chemicals are used in making plastic resins for eyewear lenses, medicines and chemicals used by farmers. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nThe PPG Barberton facility complies with Occupational Safety & Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule (29 CFR 1910.119), applicable Ohio and federal EPA regulations, and applicable Coast Guard and Department of Transportation requirements.  PPG also follows the Responsible Care Codes of Management Practice, including the Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Code to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG's EHS Process requires each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in th"

All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, which goal is design, build and operate our facilities in ways that prevent harm to public health and the environment, conserve energy, water and raw materials, integrate pollution prevention and make a positive contribution to the surrounding community and to society as a whole..\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\nPPG's prevention program consists of several layers of protection to assure that the plant is designed, operated and maintained safely.  Trained personnel are the key to a safely designed, a safely operated and a safely maintained plant.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used.  These standards include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, flammable and toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, a fire water system and computer controls for the processes.  Employees at the facility receive job-appropriate training.  Safety, environmental, operating and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates, as appropriate.  Also, the Barberton facility uses maintenance and inspection programs that are designed to minimize the possibility of equipment, piping or control failures. These programs include procedures such as X-ray testing and thickness measurements.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed for each of the five toxic chemicals in the Barberton facility.  EPA rules require that a worst-case scenario be analyzed which would involve the highly unlikely release in ten minutes of the entire contents of the largest storage container.  Based on off-site consequence look-up tables and EPA guidelines and specified assumptions, a worst-case phosgene release would cause the greatest off-site impact, although it is the least-likely scenario to actually occur. PPG-Barberton has no fla"

Evaluations from these planning-case scenarios did not show an off-site impact.  These scenarios followed the guidelines provided by EPA and used the RMP Comp Software to perform the end-point calculations.  The local fire departments of the City of Barberton & the City of Norton, local emergency planning committee, Summit County LEPC, and Summit County Emergency Management Agency use the planning-case scenario information, along with PPG experts, to develop emergency response plans, train responders, perform practice drills and maintain the appropriate equipment.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Barberton facility had no RMP reportable accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nPPG personnel are trained and ready to respond to emergencies. The local fire department personnel and other safety forces are prepared to help if needed.  Operators, supervisors and maintenance mechanics are trained in responding to various emergencies.  PPG's response plans are shared with local fire and police departments and other emergency responders.  PPG conducts emergency practice drills with its employees and local safety forces.  In addition, special emergency response equipment is located throughout the plant.  Emergency equipment is inspected and tested on a regular basis so that it is ready at all times.  Alarms alert PPG-Barberton personnel of a spill or release.  If necessary, local officials will notify citizens by using community sirens, announcements on local radio and TV stations and police contacting people in the area by using bullhorns and going door-to-door.  Citizens are instructed to either shelter in place or evacuate until the all clear signal is given by local"
