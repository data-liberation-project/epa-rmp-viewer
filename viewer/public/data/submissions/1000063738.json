              "Description": "PRODUCTION PROCESS\n\n\n\nLAYERS OF PROTECTION\n\n\n\nPPG has developed numerous layers of protection to reduce the likelihood of accidents and releases.  These layers of protection focus on:  \n\n- designing for safety, \n\n- achieving consistent/quality operations, and \n\n- maintaining the facilities.  \n\n\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nPPG employees are the most important component of these layers.  Employees design, operate and maintain our chemical manufacturing and storage processes.  Employees strive to make continuous improvements to ensure that systems and equipment are working properly.  Skilled maintenance technicians are used to repair the equipment properly and to diagnose potential problems before a breakdown occurs.\n\n\n\nCODES AND CONTROLS\n\nThe prevention program utilized by PPG is implemented by using national codes and standards to design the processes we operate.  PPG also uses state-of-the-art computer controls to give optimum operating capabilities and include prevention techniques designed for safety.  Emergency shutdown systems are designed for each process to automatically shut down equipment should an upset occur.  Every process has been reviewed to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and compliance is re-certified on a continual basis.\n\n\n\nPROCEDURES AND TRAINING\n\nPPG maintains excellent operations as another key layer of protection against a release or spill.  These operations include up-to-date operating procedures, continuous operator training and safety reviews on operation changes.  \n\n\n\nSAFE WORK PERMITS \n\nAdditionally, PPG supports effective maintenance as a key layer of protection.  This is achieved by using skilled maintenance personnel to perform all maintenance activities.  As part of the safety preplanning activities for plant maintenance, PPG enforces safe work procedures such as safe work permits, hot work permits, excavation permits, confined space permits, lockout-tagout procedures and elevated work permits.\n\n\n\nPREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE\n\nAnother proactive maintenance program used by PPG is the preventative maintenance (PM) program.  PPG associates manage this program using a computer software program called SAP.  This software program produces maintenance work orders at a predetermined frequency for all process equipment.  Skilled maintenance technicians complete the work order by inspecting and replacing critical equipment as required, therefore preventing a spill or release.  \n\n\n\nMONITORING AND DETECTION EQUIPMENT\n\nPPG has several chlorine, phosgene, allyl alcohol and carbon monoxide monitors throughout the Optical Materials area.  These monitors provide early warning to operations of a release or spill so that it can be mitigated immediately.  Finally, PPG operators, engineers, supervisors and managers inspect equipment, piping and instruments as part of their operational routine to add another layer of protection to PPG's accident prevention and chemical safety program.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\n\nPPG employees are trained and equipped to respond to emergencies should they occur.  Drills are conducted to test response capabilities, which include use of community emergency responders and the SAFER real-time modeling system.  The drills and annual emergency response procedure reviews are designed to ensure PPG and the communities are prepared to deal with emergencies.",

              "Description": "STORAGE PROCESS\n\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe Storage Process only includes the chlorine and allyl alcohol railcars that are kept on the storage track before being moved to the Optical Products Manufacturing process.  This process was added at the request of the OEPA during their 2002 visit.  Most prevention programs that apply to the manufacturing process also apply to the storage process with some differences outlined below.\n\n\n\nPHA\n\nA node to address the railcar storage has been included in the Chloroformate Distribution PHA.  This node was added in 2011 and will continue to be revalidated as part of the full PHA.  Process safety information for the railcars including railcar design and safe handling is included in the electronic document management system.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThere are no specific operating procedures that address the railcar since PPG personnel do not interact with them while they are in storage.  There are procedures for connecting, disconnecting, and preparing for shipment.  The plant's Emergency Control Manual contains procedures for managing emergencies and releases of chlorine and allyl alcohol which includes these railcars.  The plant's Site Security Manual addresses access to the railcar storage area.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTraining that pertains to the railcar storage includes annual Hazmat Training, DOT training, Chlorine C-Kit Training, and drills that have included leaking railcars.  The local railroad switching line has also been provided with information on the chemicals contained in the railcars.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nThe PPG Barberton plant does not service railcars.  The chlorine railcars owned by PPG are maintained by the corporate logistics group.  The railcars are inspected according to DOT regulations.  Allyl alcohol railcars are owned by an outside supplier.  PPG expects these railcars to be maintained in accordance with all DOT regulations as well.\n\n\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nPPG INDUSTRIES, INC. BARBERTON PLANT\n\n\n\nThe PPG Industries, Inc. facility in Barberton, Ohio, manufactures optical materials, fine chemicals and silica products.  Examples of these products include:\n\n?X    Plastic resins - used by customers to make eyewear lenses like Transitions photochromic  lenses;\n\n?X    Chloroformates - used by customers to make medicines and chemicals used by farmers;\n\n?X    Silicas - used by customers to flatten and thicken paints and varnishes; \n\n?X    Teslin - a synthetic printing sheet used by our customers to make items such as menus,  identification cards, labels and children's books; and\n\n?X    Safety films and coatings - found in commercial and military aircraft windows.\n\n?X    OLED - Organic Light Emitting Diodes used in smart phones and TV screens.\n\nThe Optical Material process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Planning regulation. The EPA maintains a list of regulated chemicals and the threshold amounts that require them to be included in RMP. The five chemicals regulated by the EPA and used at the Barberton facility include phosgene, chlorine, allyl alcohol, ammonia and isopropyl chloroformate.  These chemicals are used in making plastic resins for eyewear lenses, medicines and chemicals used by farmers. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe PPG Barberton facility complies with Occupational Safety & Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule (29 CFR 1910.119), applicable Ohio and federal EPA regulations, and applicable Coast Guard and Department of Transportation requirements.  PPG also follows the Responsible Care Codes of Management Practice, including the Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Code to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG's EHS Process requires each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in th"

All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, which goal is \"design, build and operate our facilities in ways that prevent harm to public health and the environment, conserve energy, water and raw materials, integrate pollution prevention and make a positive contribution to the surrounding community and to society as a whole..\"\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nPPG's prevention program consists of several layers of protection to assure that the plant is designed, operated and maintained safely.  Trained personnel are the key to a safely designed, a safely operated and a safely maintained plant.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used.  These standards include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, flammable and toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, a fire water system and computer controls for the processes.  Employees at the facility receive job-appropriate training.  Safety, environmental, operating and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates, as appropriate.  Also, the Barberton facility uses maintenance and inspection programs that are designed to minimize the possibility of equipment, piping or control failures. These programs include procedures such as X-ray testing and thickness measurements.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed for each of the five toxic chemicals in the Barberton facility.  EPA rules require that a worst-case scenario be analyzed which would involve the highly unlikely release in ten minutes of the entire contents of the largest storage container.  Based on off-site consequence look-up tables and EPA guidelines and specified assumptions, a worst-case phosgene release would cause the greatest off-site impact, although it is the least-likely scenario to actually occur. PPG-Barberton has no fla"

Evaluations from these planning-case scenarios did not show an off-site impact.  These scenarios followed the guidelines provided by EPA and used the RMP Comp Software to perform the end-point calculations.  The local fire departments of the City of Barberton & the City of Norton, local emergency planning committee, Summit County LEPC, and Summit County Emergency Management Agency use the planning-case scenario information, along with PPG experts, to develop emergency response plans, train responders, perform practice drills and maintain the appropriate equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Barberton facility had no RMP reportable accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPPG personnel are trained and ready to respond to emergencies. The local fire department personnel and other safety forces are prepared to help if needed.  Operators, supervisors and maintenance mechanics are trained in responding to various emergencies.  PPG's response plans are shared with local fire and police departments and other emergency responders.  PPG conducts emergency practice drills with its employees and local safety forces.  In addition, special emergency response equipment is located throughout the plant.  Emergency equipment is inspected and tested on a regular basis so that it is ready at all times.  Alarms alert PPG-Barberton personnel of a spill or release.  If necessary, local officials will notify citizens by using community sirens, announcements on local radio and TV stations and police contacting people in the area by using bullhorns and going door-to-door.  Citizens are instructed to either \"shelter in place\" or evacuate until the \"all clear\" signal is given by local"
