This section summarizes the programs, policies, and procedures in place to reduce the risk of a hazardous materials release.\nAmerican Growers Cooling Company will utilize current and appropriate engineering practices to inspect refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and subsequent equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel and certified refrigeration contractors regularly inspect the equipment, as required.\n2.\tDescription of Source and Substance Handled\nThe American Growers Cooling Company facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia in their produce and cold storage operations. The refrigeration plant is comprised of one stationary process that provides refrigeration for cold rooms, portable vacuum cooling, pressure cooling and ice manufacturing. Produce is brought to the facility where it is pre-cooled and stored for processing and shipment. Produce includes a variety of field pack produce products.\nAmmonia is the only listed material used at this facility. The plant operates with a total charge of approximately 33,500 lbs. of ammonia distributed throughout the facility. \nThe ammonia charge is contained primarily in the high pressure receivers and the low pressure pump receivers. The remainder of the refrigerant is contained within the piping and the refrigeration coils.  \n Ammonia Refrigeration\nThe refrigeration system is a single stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry is as follows:\n1.\tLow pressure vapor is compressed to high pressure gas by refrigeration compressors.\n2.\tHigh pressure vapor is condensed to high pressure liquid by the evaporative condenser.  Condensation occurs because of heat rejection to ambient resulting from"

This is made possible by the pressure differential between the two types of vessels.  Pressure is dropped when the liquid passes though an expansion device located between the high and low pressure vessels.\n5.\tThe evaporators are recirculation types where low pressure liquid is pumped from low pressure receiver. The evaporators are room coils for maintaining cold room or freezer storage temperatures.\n6.\tEvaporation of the low pressure liquid occurs due to warmer air coming in contact with the evaporators. The evaporation produces the cooling effect.  \nA mixture of liquid and vapor is returned to the low pressure vessel. Low pressure vapor is drawn off by the compressors and the liquid is circulated back through the room coils. The refrigeration system consists of the following equipment\n\u00c2\u00bf\tSeven compressors\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThree low pressure receivers\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThree high pressure receivers \n\u00c2\u00bf\tSeven fixed evaporative cooling condensers\n\u00c2\u00bf\tRoom cooling evaporators\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA diffusion system\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAutomatic controls for the individual systems \nThe Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection (IIAR) Checklists, included in the document binder, describe equipment details.

The gas is pungent and may cause suffocation, as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, and serious ski"

The following summarizes the programs, policies, and procedures in place to reduce the risk of a hazardous materials release.\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe program consists of pre-startup inspection, emergency response, and regular training. A thorough review of the system including a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA or Hazop) was performed in 2000, and re-validated for this RMP. Equipment corrections and updates were made for those items determined to have the highest potential for offsite releases.  \nSafety and equipment operational training is conducted on a yearly basis and will include equipment operational procedures, emergency response procedures, review of Business Response Procedures, and evacuation procedures. Additional items requiring further review, correction, and/or updating will be identified. Refrigeration equipment will be reviewed and the RMP will be updated when changes to equipment occur or when new equipment is brought on-site. \nAmerican Growers Cooling Company maintains an accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.

The equipment is inspected during the off-season and any repairs or change outs are made at this time. This off-season time is used to prepare the equipment for non-stop operation during the season.\nThe refrigeration system is monitored and controlled by an Andover computer control system. This system monitors the refrigeration process parameters and the system ammonia leak detectors. Each on-call operator carries a pager. The operators will be paged by the Andover system in the event of out of specification system operation or on the detection of an ammonia release.\nOperators and onsite personnel provide initial emergency response. Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an offsite release. Local fire and police departments will provide emergency response for a major release event with mutual aide response from on-site personnel. Emergency contact information is included in the document binder.\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years. \nSafety\nThe ammonia refrigeration operation system has specific safety measures in place to prevent accidental release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.
