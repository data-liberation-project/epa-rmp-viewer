All\napplicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are\nfollowed.  The WTP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are\ntailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and\nmeets the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe Town of Billerica WTP, located at 250 Boston Road, Billerica, Massachusetts, is required to\nprovide disinfection of the treated water before its discharge to the water distribution system.  The\nTown presently utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection to meet the minimum standards of the Safe\nDrinking Water Act.  Nine one-ton containers of pressurized liquid chlorine are located on site. \nThree one-ton containers of chlorine are located within the building of which two are manifolded to\nthe chlorination system. The remaining six cylinders of chlorine are each stored in one-ton\ncontainers on an exterior elevated rack.  \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst\ncase release\" and \"alternative scenario.\"  EPA defines the first scenario, which states that \"the owner\nor operator shall assume that the  . . .  maximum quantity in the largest vessel  . . .  is released as a\ngas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more\nlikely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to de"

      "SummaryText": "termine the distance traveled by the\nchlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3\nppm (chlorine), which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The\nAmerican Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) defines this as the \"maximum airborne\nconcentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one\nhour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms\nwhich could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population\nwithin a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to\nestimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a failure of a one-ton storage tank containing either 2,000\npounds of chlorine.  The offsite consequence analysis for these tanks was performed for two sets of\nconditions.  The first set of conditions was predefined by the EPA.  This analysis assumed that the\nvessel would completely release all of its contents in ten minutes.  The toxic endpoint used was the\none-hour average ERPG-2.  The population residing within a full circle with a radius corresponding\nto the toxic endpoint distance was determined. \n\nFor the worst-case modeling analysis, the EPA-mandated meteorological conditions were used. \nThese correspond to Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/s, highest daily temperature of 77oF and an\naverage humidity of 50%.\n\nFrom the modeling results, it was concluded that the radius which corresponded to the toxic endpoint\ndistance was 3.0 miles.  Within the 3.0 miles, approximately 46,800 people would be affected by this\nEPA-specified release and the corresponding conditions.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine.  In this case,\nhowever, the release is inside a building. The release is assumed to be over a ten-minute time period.\nLiquid chlorine "
