Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (68.155(a))\r\nSysco Albany is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by Sysco's comprehensive accidental release prevention program. It is Sysco's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such releases to occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the Clifton Park Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a768.155(b))\r\nWe have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process and operational requirements, is 17,000 pounds (rounded to two significant digits for reporting purposes).\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a768.155(c))\r\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. Our ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nSysco Albany maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: \r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.

These procedures address the various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training on operating procedures is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\nSysco Albany carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment\r\ndeficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco Albany to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.
