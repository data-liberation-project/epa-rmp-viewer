      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Eunice Natural Gas Extraction Plant (the Plant), located in the town of Eunice in Acadia Parish, Louisiana, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and safe design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facilityA?s processes.  The Company policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nInlet natural gas that enters the plant via pipelines is separated from any free liquids, dehydrated by molecular sieves and cooled in the gas-to-gas heat exchanger (Stationary Source). There are two cryogenic units at the plant, Plant 1 and 2, with capacities of 375 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) and 500 MMSCFD, respectively.  Inlet gas (Regulated Substance) is cooled via expansion through the turbo expander and then fed through the demethanizer (Stationary Source) to further separate the liquids (referred to as raw feed or Y-grade, Regulated Substance) from the residue gas stream. The extracted residue gas (methane) is recompressed and shipped off-site via a transmission pipeline distribution to markets.\n\nThe inlet gas also has the option of extracting Y-grade through the lean oil plant.  This plant has the capacity to process 325 MMSCFD of inlet gas.  The extracted Y-grade is treated through a liquid amine treating unit to remove CO2 and shipped offsite via a transmission pipeline.  The Plant also has the ability to fractionate the Y-grade into its individual components through the 30,000 barrels per day fractionation train.  The fractionated products (ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane, natural gasoline, Regulated Substances) are stored at the plant in "

Transmission pipelines are not Stationary Sources for purposes of the RMP.  \n\nThe substances handled at the Plant were evaluated for toxic characteristics and it was determined that there are no toxic substances exceeding the threshold quantity handled at the Plant.  The propane, butane, iso-butane, and Y-grade are flammable substances present at the Plant in excess of threshold quantities and, therefore, subject to this program.  Based on the worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors; therefore, the Plant is classified as Program level 3.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1-psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion assuming an instantaneous release.  A yield factor of 10% of the available energy released in the explosion is used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  Because of the quantities of butanes present onsite, this product will present the worst-case flammable substance release that will result in the greatest distance to the endpoint, 0.61 mile.\n\nFlammable Substances Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA plausible alternative release scenario involves propane should the seal failure on the propane pipeline pump to occur, which will cause a release through one-inch opening at 1100 psig and 70 degrees F.  10 minutes is assumed for the duration of the release, which may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1-psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability limit (L"

The alternative-case release of propane results in a 0.18-mile distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint and less than 0.06 mile distance to the LFL endpoint.  \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThere are no toxic substances held above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required for this Plant.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program implemented at the Plant.  Because the processes at the Plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the PSM program at the Plant is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent and/or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include safety committees (which are made up of a cross-section of employees and supervisors), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, hazcom, etc.). Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\n\nProcess Saf"

The PSI is useful to the operators, team performing PHAs, those in charge of employee training, contractors and third-party vendors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans and emergency action plans.  PSI is incorporated into the PSM Manual and is readily available to all employees.  \n\nThe Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemicals properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nThe Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with the written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the hazard analysis results are updated and revalidated periodically.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained in the PlantA?s files.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.

To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  The refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

In addition, the Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  The Plant personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\n\nThe Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on: (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.
