All applicable procedures of the federal Program are adhered to. CGPFC?s emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nCGFPC is a retailer of anhydrous ammonia for agricultural purposes. This facility serves the local area farmers with ammonia for purposes of facilitating crop growth. The facility contains anhydrous ammonia in four storage tanks located along the northeast corner of the facility. The storage vessels, piping, pumps, and various other equipment are interconnected within the storage area. The station is usually unmanned unless utilized. Yardsmen visit the station daily and respond to any problems and alarms as they may occur.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two ammonia release scenarios, identified as ?worst case release? and ?alternative release scenario.? the first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that ?the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes, ?due to an unspecified failure. The alternative release scenario is one that is ?more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.?\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the toxic substance released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint? selected by the EPA of 0.14 mg/L for anhydrous ammonia, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nea"

      "SummaryText": "rly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, ?to estimate the population potentially affected.?\n\nThe worst case release scenario at CGFPC involves a failure of the lines and all mitigation systems within the station between any of the tanks. Because all the tanks, pipes, pumps, and other equipment are interconnnected, the total amount of anhydrous ammonia that potentially could be released would amass to approximately 216,000 pounds. The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions. The first set followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding tot he toxic endpoint distance. EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n    ?    Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of a release point is potentially affected. This plume, or footprint, is approximately 6% (one-twentieth) of the area of a the full circle.   \n\n    ?    It is not appropriate to compare a 10-minute release to a one hour average standard. The one hour ERPG value can be modified using available time of exposure/concentration relationships to match the ten minute release time.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenarios were performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 5.0 miles and an estimate of population potentially affected of 37,000 was obtained, as a result of the entire city of Casa Grande and surrounding area was encompassed. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of a tank poss"

The latter is defined by AIHA as ?the maximum airborne concentrations below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects.? The typical meteorological conditions used for these scenarios was a Stability Class D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, average air temperature, and average humidity. The estimated distances traveled to the toxic endpoints was 0.5 miles for ERPG-2.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n?    High level of training of the operators.\n?    Preventative maintenance programs.\n?    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n    ?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n?    Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n?    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by operators during connection/disconnection of ammonia supply, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of ammonia.\n\nNo accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated (reviewed) by the Casa Grande Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC). This program includes emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted once every year. Emergency response and response procedures are also reviewed at this time."
