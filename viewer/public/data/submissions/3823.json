Daily checks involve visual inspections and inventory status.  On a monthly basis the Maintenance Operator checks the general operation and serviciability of the equipment, including the off-hoist system, chlorine scrubber, feed equipment, chlorine sensor,and piping.  Scrubber media is sampled and tested quarterly per the manufacturer's recommendation (Purafil). In addition the scrubber blower system is greased and belts instected quarterly.  The scrubber is also scheduled for annual service per the manufacturer's recommendation.  SCBA and a leak repair kit is maintained by the City Fire Dept.  They maintain their training and certification and respond to the Water Department's emergency response via preestablished protocols.",

      "SummaryText": "The Grand Forks Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is located at 503 South Fourth Street.  The plant currently uses chlorine to disinfect the drinking water for the city.  At any point in time the city keeps an inventory of no more than 9 one-ton cylinders or 18000 pounds of this product on site.  Product arrives at the plant along designated truck routes developed in conjunction with the Fire Dept. to minimize risk to the public.  All chlorine cylinders are stored in a clearly labeled and confined area of the treatment plant.  The plant has a vacuum operated feed system which  minimizes discharges within the facility.  In 1996 the WTP installed a chlorine scrubber system to neutralize any discharges occurring during the storing or handling of this material.\nThe Risk Management Plan being submitted by the City of Grand Forks is a composite of:\n1.  Definition of a worst case hazard assessment involving the accidental release of the contenets of a one ton cylinder of chlorine during the unloading process.  A release of this nature would release a hazardous material into a residential neighborhood. The Water Department has worked with the Fire Department in developing a scenerio involving the evacuation of residents and Water Plant employees.  The plant operator will initiate a response by the Fire Dept. by calling 911.\n2.  An alternate release scenerio where chlorine is released within the chlorine storage area was assessed.  In this case we are relying on the chlorine scrubber to neutralize the hazardous material. In all likelyhood this scenerio would be confined to the chlorine room.  The Fire Department for the city maintains the chlorine leak repair kit as part of their Haz-Mat response equipment.  The chlorine scrubber automatically starts at a  2 ppm chlorine dectection limit. The plant preventative maintenance program addresses scrubber operation and testing procedures.\n3.  WTP has taken many preventative measures to minimize risks. The chlorine storage area is separa"

At this time room ventilation systems were upgraded.  Following a spring flood in 1997 the utility's electrical control room was upgraded and moved from the flood plain.  The WTP also maintains a stand-by power generator that is capable of operating all in plant processes.\n4.  The WTP Operations staff work with a computerized preventative maintenance program to schedule maintenance on all feed equipment, unloading euipment, chlorine scrubber, air handling and related building systems.  Inspections are done daily, monthly, quarterly and annually.  The scrubber media is tested and maintained according to manufacturer's recommendations.\n5.  The Water Department works closely with the Fire Department and Emergency Operations Center.  Sara Title III reports are filed annually keeping them informed of the materials stored at the WTP.  The Fire Department maintains a Haz-Mat team that responds to chemical hazards at the WTP and  throught the community.  They maintain SCBA equipment, haz-mat suits and the chlorine leak repair kit.\n6.  Administration of the RMP will be the responsibility of the  Water Department Superintendent.  The Superintendent will serve as a liason to the Director of Public Works, Mayor's office, Fire Dept and the LEPC.  Training and preparedness exercises will be coordinated with these local agencies.  WTP operating staff currently have monthly safety and contingency plan reviews in order to remain current on departmental policies and procedures.  \nIn the future this document will assist the department in it's critical assessment of our emergency response policies and procedures."
