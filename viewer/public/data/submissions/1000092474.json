This start-up is scheduled for the 2nd quarter 2021.\r\nThe operation of the specific Limetree Bay Refinery (LBR) process units continue to be in conjunction with Limetree Bay Terminal Facility. This facility was previously owned and operated by Hovensa, LLC (Hovensa), and it was shut down in 2012. On January 4, 2016 LBR bought the facility and commence redesigning and upgrading some process units taking in considerations all RMP requirements. The restart of specific refinery process units was initiated during period the third quarter 2020, with the units included in this RMP submission.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe refinery provides employment for about 800 people (LBR and Contractor employees). Many of the employees, including senior officers of LBR, live in company housing adjacent to the refinery. The reconfigured refinery can process up to 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day, using a variety of processes to convert crude oil into various petroleum products (e.g., fuel oils, diesel, kerosene, jet fuel, gasoline, and propane). The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as hydrogen, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and one regulated toxic material which is anhydrous ammonia. OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS Worst Case Scenario-Toxic\r\nThe worst-case scenario for anhydrous ammonia is failure of the ammonia storage drum containing approximately 110,000 pounds. The cloud formed from this release is expected to reach offsite receptors. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such a release and to manage the consequences, no administrative controls (including release prevention measures) or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\r\nAlte"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training employees and implementing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of its processes. The company's policy is to protect the community and its workers from accidental releases of chemical substances and to reduce the extent and impact of a release. However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained to respond, control, contain, and mitigate the release.\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the LBR refinery. Processes at the refinery, which are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \r\nEmployee Participation\r\nLBR requires employees to participate in all facets of their PSM and accident prevention program. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents. developing operating procedures and chemical information and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training (re-certification) on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least once every 3 years. All operator training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\nContractors\r\nLBR uses contractors to supplement its work force. Some contractors work on or near process equipment; therefore, the refinery (1) informs contractors of hazards known to the refinery which are related to the contractor's work and the processes in the area of such work; (2) makes sure that the contractor understands what to do in the event of an emergency; (3) develops and implements safe work practices, such as permit systems, to control contractor entrance, presence and exit from the process areas; (4) provides the contractor with site safety rules and applicable safe operating practice procedures; and (5) requires that contractors inform site safety personnel of hazards they encounter. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, LBR evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as a part of the contractor selection process. Also, refinery personnel periodically monitor and evaluate contractor performance to verify that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations once onsite.\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\nLBR conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

This review provides one additional check to confirm construction on equipment modifications are in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nLBR has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections/tests and documenting results, (4) preventive maintenance, (5) correcting identified deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable operating limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a Management of Change ("

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage such hazards.\r\nThe primary method used is the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, What-If', or PHA checklist technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, technical and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards along with accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the various departments (i.e., Operations, Technical & Engineering, Reliability, and Maintenance). Resolution implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This risk ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, LBR periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency throughout the life of each process. The r"

Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. LBR incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs such as the Repair Stamp Program. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nLBR has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) process unit control entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag-out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed in a safe manner.\r\nManagement of Change\r\nLBR has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with the necessa"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the refinery management for approval. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.\r\nThe final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.\r\nIncident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA studies.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, LBR conducts a PSM audit, at least every three years, to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed, and the final resolution of each finding is documented. The two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe processes at LBR have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
