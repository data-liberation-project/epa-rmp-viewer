Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the Solvay Solexis Orange Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.\n\nWe are a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care Program.  The ACC Responsible Care Program goes beyond the boundaries of regulatory compliance and strives for continuous improvement in industry operations and processes by incorporating health, safety, and environmental protection into all stages of a products life ? design, manufacture, marketing, distribution, use, recycling, and disposal.\n\nThe Orange plant participates in the Orange Community Advisory Panel of local citizens who meet regularly with plant management to discuss various issues, especially those related to environmental, safety, and health.  This mechanism was established to better understand and address the needs and concerns of the local community.\n\nSolvay Solexis has been proactive in communicating our risk management program with the community.  A RMP Community Awareness event was in public meetings during April of 1998 and included participation by local industry and the local emergency response community.  The Community Advisory Panel toured our plant and employees and management were available to answer questions.  Information was distributed that explains our plant?s safety programs, release scenarios, and emergency response program.  The presentation to the general public was repeated during the community?s annual ?Gumbo Cook-Off Festival? on May 2,1998.\n\nThe following is taken from Solvay Solexis? Corporate Safety Policy:\n\nSolvay Solexis, Inc. (?Solvay Solexis?) is committed to provide a safe "

It is also the policy of Solvay Solexis that all our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Additionally, it is Solvay Solexis? policy to supply all available information pertaining to safe handling and use of its materials to customers.\n\nThe following specific points are included in Solvay Solexis policy.\n\n-Solvay Solexis, in all its operations, is committed to achieving excellence in safety.  All other activities should be consistent with this goal.\n\n-Compliance with safety and environmental laws and regulations is our top priority.  No other operations will take priority over this objective.\n\n-It is Solvay Solexis? premise that all accidents and injuries are preventable.  Therefore, every reasonable and practical effort will be made in the interest of preventing accidents that cause personal injury or property damage, both inside the corporation and outside.\n\n-Safety is the direct responsibility of all levels of line management and is an important measure of managerial performance.\n\nThe Orange Plant recognizes and is concerned that every employee shall be furnished a safe and healthful place to work, free from recognized hazards that might cause serious injuries and illness.  Every effort will be made in the interest of accident prevention, health preservation, and fire protection.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nSolvay Solexis has developed and currently markets a family of fluorine based products that are noted for their exceptional resistance to chemical agents and environments, which attack and degrade other materials.  At the Orange plant, various grades of HALAR? are manufactured that are used by customers in a number of applications, including the formulation of wire and cable coatings. The Orange plant became"

Trifluorochloroethylene is also known as chlorotrifluoroethylene, or CTFE. \n\n\n3.    Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA?s RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario \n\nThe worst-case release scenario for CTFE assumes the loss of the entire contents of the storage tank with the maximum possible amount (150,000 lbs.) in the tank at the time of its failure.  Based upon the original EPA Guidance, the distance from the source of the vapor cloud explosion to its endpoint would include offsite endpoints but no nearby public receptors. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario \n\nThe alternative release scenario for CTFE is a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE) of the tank with 75,000 pounds of CTFE. Based upon the original EPA Guidance, the distance from the source of the BLEVE to its endpoint would include offsite endpoints but no nearby public receptors.\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility is regulated under the OSHA Process Safety Management rules, which regulates the management of process safety.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents are kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  This information includes materials"

Within this program, each process or process change is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  This is performed by a team, which identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when deemed necessary.\nStandard Operating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide clear daily instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process, consistent with the process safety information.  The written procedures address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, emergency shutdown procedures, and safety and health considerations.\nTraining:   We have established a comprehensive training program to certify operators in both unit operations and emergency response procedures.  This requires operators to demonstrate (through written testing and hands-on examinations) that they have adequate knowledge before they can work independently.  This training includes emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee?s job tasks.  There is annual refresher training for all operators on the operating procedures and chemical hazards of the process.\nMechanical Integrity:  An established preventive maintenance and equipment integrity program promotes that all process equipment is operating within approved limits.  The initial and on-going integrity of process equipment is ensured by determining that the equipment is designed, installed and maintained properly.

      "SummaryText": "logy / health hazard review, air monitoring equipment, decontamination, containment procedures and spill control techniques.\n\nEmergency Response Equipment and Systems- In the event of an emergency, the following is some of the response equipment available onsite so mitigation activities can begin immediately:\n-    Highly trained emergency responders on every shift\n-    Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n-    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n-    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n-    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n-    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., backup power supply for process control system)\n-    Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n-    Deluge system for specific equipment\n-    High pressure firewater system with remote and manual water spray suppression systems to cool equipment and to            dilute and disperse vapors\n-    Video camera system offers 24 hour remote monitoring of the facility\n-    Spill containment equipment and supplies\n-    Air monitoring equipment\n-    Neutralization of liquid spills\n-    Two-way radio communication with emergency responders\n\n7.    Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nAn automatic deluge system that will provide protection for the raw material storage area including the CTFE storage tank and charge pumps is planned. This system is used to mitigate an accidental release to minimize the potential impact.\nWe will continue to incorporate the findings from incident investigations and the recommendations developed during process hazard analysis as a means of continuously improving the safety at the Orange Plant.\n"
