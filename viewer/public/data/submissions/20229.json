The operations at the Medina facility include the processing and storage of perishable prepared food products for public consumption.  These products are packaged under the familiar Sandridge Gourmet Salads brand name and distributed locally.  Sandridge has been in operation at this facility for 15 years providing quality products and over 250 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSandridge is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  It is Sandridge's policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTo ensure the quality of Sandridge's final products, refrigeration is necessary to maintain the low temperatures required for the food processing and storage areas of the plant.  These requirements are promulgated and monitored by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Ohio State Department of Agriculture and the United States Food and Drug Administration.  In addition, the refrigeration system is utilized to operate large coolers and freezers for the storage of ingredients and finished products.  To achieve this, Sandridge uses anhydrous ammonia, the 112(r) regulated substance, as the refrigerant in the cooling system.  The ammonia refrigeration system maintains the 110,000 square-foot facility within the required range of operating temperature"

      "SummaryText": "s and provides the cooling necessary for the production and storage of their products.  Anhydrous ammonia is a standard refrigerant for the food industries and widely used throughout the country.  The refrigeration system at Sandridge Food Corporation's Medina facility consists of compressors, condensers, receiver vessels, pumps, evaporators, heat exchangers, air handling units, and the associated piping for this equipment.  At the time of this RMP filing, a large plant expansion project, including the installation of additional refrigeration equipment, was underway.  This system expansion will require the addition of ammonia to the system.  Engineering calculations and system operational experience estimate that the system could contain up to approximately 21,300 pounds of ammonia after the expansion.  The contents of this Risk Management Plan, including the release scenarios and consequence modeling, are based upon the post-expansion system conditions and increased ammonia inventory.  It is anticipated, based on project schedules at the time of this filing, that ammonia could be added to the system as early as February 2, 2000.\n \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Sandridge Food Corporation has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is defined as the release, over a 10-minute period, of the entire contents of the largest vessel or pipe in the facility's system.  Based on the design of Sandridge's refrigeration system at the Medina facility, the worst case release scenario would involve the rupture of the High Pressure Receiver (HPR), which is the largest single vessel in the system.  The High Pressure Receiver can contain up to approximately 11,068 pounds of ammonia when filled to 100% of capacity.  The HPR, like all other major vessels in the system, is located inside the facility's compressor room, more commonly known as the engine ro"

      "SummaryText": "om.  The engine room has four interior doors leading into other sections of the building and no exterior doors or windows leading directly to the atmosphere.  While the room provides passive mitigation for a release, the room is equipped with a ventilation fan that exhausts to the outside atmosphere.  The basis for the worst case release scenario involves 100% of the volume of the High Pressure Receiver being released to the compressor room and then exhausted through the fan.  Using the equations in Chapter 4 of the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the maximum distance to the specified \"endpoint\" was calculated.  This is a conservative distance, established by the EPA, at which it is expected that a person could be exposed to the chemical for an hour without suffering irreversible health effects.  The distance to the endpoint, calculated for the worst-case release scenario, includes offsite receptors.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered by Sandridge Food Corporation to be a likely release scenario for the facility.  During normal operations, the High Pressure Receiver is maintained at a level between 10% and 25% of its total capacity.  The HPR has never been filled to 100% capacity, the volume used in the worst case scenario calculations, in the operating history of the plant.  The highest level of ammonia that has ever been stored in the High Pressure Receiver is approximately 75% of the total volume.  This only occurs during a pump-down of the refrigeration system for maintenance or the addition of new equipment.  A pump-down of the entire system has only occurred once every 3 to 4 years, usually due to a system expansion.  However, since the current system expansion will include the addition of enough ammonia to make a 100% volume scenario physically possible, this quantity was used to provide the absolute worst case scenario possible.  The other event that could potentially cause a higher th"

This scenario considers the facility's 15-year history of operational experience and the potential hazards identified in the process hazard analysis (PHA) study conducted by Sandridge.  The PHA study was performed to ensure that the potential hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration system were identified and minimized.  The analysis was conducted in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations contained in 29 CFR 1910.119.  The alternate release scenario identified by Sandridge involves damaging a = inch diameter pipe, resulting in the release of liquid ammonia.  When considering the potential alternate release scenarios, all piping routed to and installed on equipment located outside the buildings was considered first.  In developing the release parameters of this alternative scenario, Sandridge considered piping and equipment located in areas where vehicle traffic, personnel foot traffic, and work-related activities were likely to occur.  The resulting scenario involves damage to a = inch high-pressure liquid line running along the roof of the building.  The piping is located in an area where plant personnel perform work activities and pass through to other areas of the roof.  This makes the potential for damage by tools, equipment or personnel a credible scenario for consideration.  The alternative case release scenario involves damage to the pipe resulting in a < inch diameter opening and the release of high-pressure liquid ammonia.  The scenario also includes a conservative estimate of the response time necessary to control the release.  \n\nUsing the equations in Chapter 4 of the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the maximum distance to the specified \"endpoi"

The distance to the endpoint, calculated for the alternate case release scenario, includes offsite receptors.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Sandridge has implemented several precautionary measures including process and equipment controls, operating procedures, preventive maintenance programs, employee training, and audit programs.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with industry standards and good engineering practices. \n\nSandridge has also developed and implemented a Process Safety Management program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the refrigeration system for the potential to release anhydrous ammonia.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia include process equipment (pressure relief valves, check valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shutoffs, microprocessor control, ammonia leak detection systems, and electrical distribution system grounding). \n\nSandridge has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  These procedures incorporate safety measures to prevent employee injury, equipment damage, and accidental releases.  The procedures were developed by a team consisting of personnel from operations and maintenance, plant engineering, and Sandridge's PSM contractor.
