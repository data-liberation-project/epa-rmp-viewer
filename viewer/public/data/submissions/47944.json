Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nEnterprise Products is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur at the TEPPCO Todhunter Terminal, our response activities are coordinated with the Monroe Fire Department.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Todhunter Terminal?s RMP?regulated activity is the processing (fractionation and dehydration), storage, and loading of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  We have three (3) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are propane [CAS# 74-98-6], butane [CAS# 106-97-8], and ethyl mercaptan [ethanethiol, CAS# 75-08-1].  Pure propane and butane is received by pipeline for storage and delivery out either by pipeline (propane and butane) or by truck (propane only).  Unregulated gasoline products are also received by pipeline for storage at and redelivery from the facility.  Mixed interface liquid volumes (propane/butane, propane/gasoline or butane/gasoline) from the inlet pipelines are stored in underground mined cavern.  From time to time, these mixed LPG and gasoline liquids are set to a fractionation unit to separate the propane, butane and gasoline back into relatively pure components for storage and redelivery.  Ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize the propane that is delivered from the facility by truck for safety purposes.  The butane portion of the LPG is returned to cavern storage, and the gasoline is sent to storage tanks.  Th"

No compounds classified as ?toxic? are stored or used at the facility in amounts above their threshold quantities.  The maximum on-site inventory of propane, butane and mercaptan subject to regulation under 40 CFR Part 68 at any one time is detailed in the RMP submission.  For RMP regulatory purposes, the unregulated gasoline included with the regulated compounds in the feed and product from the fractionation unit is reported as pentane.  Unregulated jet fuel is also received, stored and delivered from Todhunter terminal, but this product is not mixed with or processed with the covered flammable substances.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario, are reported in Risk Management Program registration.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA RMP-Comp calculation program provided online from the EPA. \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the plant?s PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM complian"

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a ?near-miss? reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Todhunter Terminal has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls "

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Todhunter Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Todhunter Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas and fractionation plant operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operat"

All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Todhunter Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to insure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the Todhunter Terminal and Enterprise evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nTodhunter Terminal conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
