              "Description": "This process includes two tanks, tank A and tank B and a pump.  The system operates with all valves opened.  The valves will close automatically due to loss of system pressure under the following conditions:\n                                     \n     1.  Loss of nitrogen supply.\n     2.  Rupture of Nitrogen tubing due to mechanical failure.\n     3.  A fire at the unloading pump will cause the plastic tubing to \n          melt therefore sealing the vessel.\n     4.  Power failure.\n     5.  Switch turned (manually).\n     6.  High storage tank temperature.\n     7.  High rate of rise in level in storage tank temperature.\n\nAll information included in this prevention program  applies to both tanks and the pump with the following exceptions:\n\n   1.   The pump is not equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nThe system is equipped with a camera monitoring device as an additional safeguard in detecting any deficiencies in the safe operation of the process and to prevent the risk of any accidential releases.",

Ethylene oxide, methyl chloride (toxic chemicals) and trimethylamine (flammable chemical) are utilized at this facility for the manufacture of nutritional animal food products for the poultry, beef, dairy, and companion animal industry.  DuCoa's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by the incorporation of the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passive mitigation, and monitoring detection systems.  Ducoa adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of these chemicals.\n\nAll information regarding DuCoa's Risk Management Plan has been submitted to EPA utilizing EPA's RMP* Submit software program.  It should be noted that the RMP* Submit software program does not allow a facility to assign a Process ID number.  The process ID number is automatically generated by EPA and does not necessary represent the number of regulated processes at this facility.  For example, the three processes regulated under this standard are assigned Process ID 2, Process ID 3, and Process ID 4.  The purpose of this number as provided by the RMP* Submit software is to help facilities track multiple processes.   The same holds true for the id numbers represented in the worst-case and alternative release scenarios in Section 2 and Section 3 of the RMP data elements. \n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO:\n\nEPA has defined a worst-case release as, \"a release"

All releases are assumed to take place at ground level.\n\nIt is only required to document on the actual RMP a worst-case scenario for one toxic chemical and for one flammable chemical.  Therefore, you will find that the worst-case scenario for Ethylene oxide is the only chemical used in the RMP for the worst-case scenario for toxic substances due to the fact that the worst-case scenario for Ethylene oxide had the largest area of off-site impact.\n\nMeteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined by EPA Guidance as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour), and ambient air temperature of 25 degrees C. \n\nTwo choices are provided for topography for the worst-case scenario, rural or urban.\n\nIt should be noted that the calculations and numbers used in the following summary vary from the numbers entered in the data elements of the RMP due to EPA requiring rounding to certain significant digits.   \n\nThe worst-case scenarios for DuCoa's regulated toxic and flammable substances are as follows:\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR ETHYLENE OXIDE - TOXIC SUBSTANCE\n\nThe worst-case scenario release was determined by taking the greatest amount held in a vessel in the process, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.

EPA requires that regulated substances that are gases at ambient temperature should be considered gases for consequences analysis.  Ethylene oxide, although liquefied under pressure, is a gas under ambient conditions.  Therefore, the release scenario would be considered a toxic gas release.  The entire contents of the vessel are assumed to be released over a period of 10 minutes.  \n\nA wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of F was used in calculating the worst-case scenario per Risk Management Guidance, and the topography of the area surrounding the property is rural. \n\nThe toxic endpoint for ethylene oxide is 0.090 mg/L.  Per the EPA guidance document mentioned above, \"this airborne concentration has been published by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) and is the maximum airborne concentration below which is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".\n\nUsing these parameters it was determined (using EPA* Comp.) that with a release of 175,000 lb., an estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is 12 miles. \n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR TRIMETHYLAMINE - FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCE\n\nAccording to EPA guidance document \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance - May 24, 1996\".

Vapor Cloud Fire\n2. Pool Fire\n3. BLEVE - Boiling liquid, expanding vapor explosion\n4. Vapor Cloud Explosion\n5. Jet Fire\n\nDue to the characteristics of trimethylamine, it was determined that a vapor cloud fire would be the most likely event resulting from a release.  A vapor cloud fire (flash fire) is assumed to result from dispersion of a cloud of trimethylamine vapor and ignition of the cloud following dispersion.  Such a fire could flash back and could represent a severe heat radiation hazard to anyone in the area of the cloud.  The lower flammability limit for trimethylamine is 48 mg/L, which represents the maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire might have serious consequences.  Vapor cloud fires are considered instantaneous events, therefore release duration does not need to be considered for estimating vapor cloud fire distances.\n\nThe alternative release scenario identified for the trimethylamine process would be a gasket or line failure downstream of the pump.

It should be noted that no data is reported for Program 2 in the RMP Submit data because DuCoa is subject only to Program 3.

It is DuCoa's policy to contact the local emergency planning committee, and the local fire department (Aurora Rural Fire Department) in the event of a hazardous chemical release.  DuCoa has contracted an emergency response group (Environmental Management, Inc.) that will respond to any hazardous chemical releases and any cleanup operations.  DuCoa has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on its emergency response plan, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, they will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is necessary.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nDuCoa is continuously improving the safe operation of the ethylene oxide, methyl chloride and trimethylamine processes by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the equipment and the system.
