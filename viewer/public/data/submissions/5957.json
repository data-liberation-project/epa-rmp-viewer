Ethylene oxide, methyl chloride (toxic chemicals) and trimethylamine (flammable chemical) are utilized at this facility for the manufacture of nutritional animal food products for the poultry, beef, dairy, and companion animal industry.  DuCoa's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by the incorporation of the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passive mitigation, and monitoring detection systems.  Ducoa adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of these chemicals.\n\nAll information regarding DuCoa's Risk Management Plan has been submitted to EPA utilizing EPA's RMP* Submit software program.  It should be noted that the RMP* Submit software program does not allow a facility to assign a Process ID number.  The process ID number is automatically generated by EPA and does not necessary represent the number of regulated processes at this facility.  For example, the three processes regulated under this standard are assigned Process ID 2, Process ID 3, and Process ID 4.  The purpose of this number as provided by the RMP* Submit software is to help facilities track multiple processes.

Jet Fire\n\nDue to the characteristics of trimethylamine, it was determined that a vapor cloud fire would be the most likely event resulting from a release.  A vapor cloud fire (flash fire) is assumed to result from dispersion of a cloud of trimethylamine vapor and ignition of the cloud following dispersion.  Such a fire could flash back and could represent a severe heat radiation hazard to anyone in the area of the cloud.  The lower flammability limit for trimethylamine is 48 mg/L, which represents the maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire might have serious consequences.

It is DuCoa's policy to contact the local emergency planning committee, and the local fire department (Aurora Rural Fire Department) in the event of a hazardous chemical release.  DuCoa has contracted an emergency response group (Environmental Management, Inc.) that will respond to any hazardous chemical releases and any cleanup operations.  DuCoa has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on its emergency response plan, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, they will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is necessary.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nDuCoa is continuously improving the safe operation of the ethylene oxide, methyl chloride and trimethylamine processes by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the equipment and the system.
