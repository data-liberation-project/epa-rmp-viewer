JCG is operated by Jerritt Canyon Gold LLC and is comprised of mining and milling operations which are principally located in Section 33, Township 41 North, Range 54 East (T41N, R54E) in Elko County, Nevada (Figure 1). JCG exceeds the threshold quantity of chlorine, as specified on the List of Regulated Substance under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68.130). Chlorine is used on site as part of JCG\u0092s air pollution control emission technology. This RMP document is intended to summarize the procedures in place at JCG to reduce the risks associated with chlorine and all other chemicals which are stored at this facility.\n\nThe purpose of this RMP is to summarize the management actions taken by JCG to appropriately handle chlorine at this site, as required by the CAP regulations. The goal of these management actions are to prevent accidental releases of chlorine which can cause serious harm to the public and the environment. The information contained in this RMP is included to assist JCG to coordinate emergency actions in the unlikely event of a release. This RMP document is not intended to be used in lieu of JCG\u0092s comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP), nor is it intended to be used in place of JCG\u0092s policies and procedures. This RMP document is intended to be used in cooperation with the ERP to mitigate a release. This document summarizes the properties of chlorine and outlines chlorine management procedures and associated training and the reporting that has been completed for CAP.\n\n1.2.\tTraining and Emergency Response Management\n\nAs a part of First Majestic Silver Corporation\u0092s commitment to protecting their employees and the environment, the company provides a \u0091new hire\u0092 initial training to all"

      "SummaryText": "personnel at the start of employment JCG. This training is to ensure that employees understand the risks of the chemicals within the facility and can respond appropriately in the event of an emergency event. JCG reinforces this initial training with additional training, throughout the year. These mandatory sessions include diverse topics such as: medical/first aid, firefighting, evacuations, and chemical management and release mitigation. \n\nEmergency procedures at JCG vary depending upon the severity of the incident and the material involved. In the event of an emergency, at JCG, employees are required to notify the Incident Commander (IC) and to leave their work areas in a safe and orderly manner without jeopardizing their safety or the safety of others. The IC assumes responsibility for the management and mitigation of the incident. \n\n1.3.\tTraining and Emergency Response Management\n\nGold bearing ore is processed at JCG using a proprietary roasting technology in association with a conventional crushing, grinding, leaching, and refining system. As a part of gold recovery, JCG has installed an air pollution control system which uses mercury chloride formation (calomel Hg2Cl2) to control releases of mercury emissions to the atmosphere. JCG\u0092s roaster air pollution control system is designed to cool the roaster off-gases and to capture and control mercury and particulate matter prior to stack exit. This is achieved with a wet scrubbing system which allows for quick and effective cooling of the roaster off-gas while at the same time providing particulate matter removal for subsequent gold recovery. This method injects chlorine gas into the off-gas stream just prior to entry of the scrubbing solution to the mercury scrubber. The required amount of chlorine is determined by an oxidation-reduction potential probe, located in the solution line. This probe measures the available oxidizer present and calculates the amount of chlorine required for the mercury oxidation reaction"

      "SummaryText": "to occur.\n\nChlorine at JCG is housed in four 2,000-pound carbon steel vessels located at the east and west end of the gas handling scrubber pad (Figure 2). The flow of chlorine from the steel vessels is controlled electronically by a gas feed rate control valve that automatically regulates the feed rate of the chlorine, based on a residual set point of 100 pounds per day. When the chlorine vessels are empty the metering tube ball located on the vessel will fall to the bottom and the red \u0091Loss of Chlorine\u0092 indicator will be visible.\n\nChlorine is delivered to JCG in 2,000-pound carbon steel vessels via truck. JCG management requires that chlorine gas not be transferred from a shipping tanker to on-site vessels via external hose. Vessels will be transferred directly from the delivery truck to the service cradles under the supervision of JCG personnel. Crews responsible for transferring vessels will consist of, at minimum, two personnel including one equipment operator and at least one person whose responsibility will be to guide and stabilize the vessels during the off-loading process.\n\n1.4.\tTraining and Emergency Response Management\n\nAll personnel responsible for handling chlorine are trained specifically to ensure that chlorine will be managed in such a manner as to mitigate any potential for accidental release or environmental exposure. Prior to maintenance or vessels exchange, JCG personnel are required to coordinate with an equipment operator and wear proper PPE including hardhat, steel toe rubber boots, reflective vest, rubber chemical-resistant gloves, full-face respirator or chemical goggles and half-face respirator with mercury/chlorine cartridges, chemical suit, and hearing protection. \n\nThe chlorine feed pressure is monitored from the digital control system display during routine shift inspections of the chlorine vessel. Inspections of the chlorine vessels and the chlorine feed pressure will be recorded at least once per shift on the shift logs. Shift logs"

As required by the CAP regulations, JCG complies with the provisions of its safety manual and applicable state and federal laws, regulations, and standards to ensure that chlorine is properly managed at JCG. Employees whose job requires direct or indirect management of the chlorine system or chlorine vessels receive training in proper operational procedures including changing the vessels and appropriate scheduled maintenance."
