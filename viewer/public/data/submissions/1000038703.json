Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at Sysco Pittsburgh are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the <Harmony Fire Dept.>, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 15,835 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If/Checklist combined.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nSysco Pittsburgh maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nSysco Pittsburgh has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least each annually and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nSysco Pittsburgh carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco Pittsburgh to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given, training to deal with the modifications.\n\n\n"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\n\n\nSysco Pittsburgh conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\n\n\nSysco Pittsburgh promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n\n\nSysco Pittsburgh believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis, in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\n\n\nOn occasion, Sysco Pittsburgh hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

We will continue our annual facility evacuation drills and planning/training site visits with the <Harmony Fire Dept.> in the future.  Increased frequency of testing has been initiated into the mechanical integrity program to check lubricant condition and vibration analysis of major refrigeration equipment. Replacement of ammonia piping segments were completed in the past five years.  Planned replacement in the future are based on ultra sonic testing results. This will continue to be priority to avoid un intended releases by maintaining the piping and insulation in good repair.      "
