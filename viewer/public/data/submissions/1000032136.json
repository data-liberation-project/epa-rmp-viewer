      "SummaryText": "VP Racing Fuels RMP Summary\r\n\r\nThe VP Racing Fuels facility produces racing fuels by purchasing commercial unleaded gasoline and commercial aviation fuel and blending in additives that boost the octane and hence performance of the racing fuels.  The facility consists of atmospheric and pressurized tanks.  The racing fuels are blended in atmospheric tanks and the racing fuel  is either shipped out in bulk via trucks or drummed and shipped out via truck.   The regulated substances at this facility are isopentane and isoprene.   \r\n\r\nThe facility has determined that the most likely release scenario of the regulated substances would be due the  catastrophic failure of the one of the pressure tanks holding the two regulated substances.   To reduce the potential impact of any release the facility has instituted managerial controls limiting the amount of regulated chemicals onsite, and physical controls that include separated dikes to contain any potential releases.    \r\n\r\nThe facility personnel will not be first responders to an accidental release requiring the assistance of outside responders.  Annual coordination meeting are held between facility personnel and the local volunteer fire department.   In addition, the Bexar County Fire Marshall\u00bfs office and the company\u00bfs insurance carrier conduct annual inspections of the site.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe facility has not had any accidental releases of any chemicals that  required reporting or additional response actions other than minor cleanup activities.   No one offsite has been affected by any of these releases."
