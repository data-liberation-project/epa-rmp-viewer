      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\n\n\nMiller Milling Saginaw, Texas facility is a flour mill, producing a variety of hard and soft flours, as well as whole wheat flour.  The facility is adding flour bleaching capabilities in the spring of 2019.  The bleaching system will use chlorine gas.  The reaction of raw flour and chlorine is complete within normal application rates of chlorine. There are no by-products or waste products created in the reaction. The end product is flour for human consumption. Chlorine used in the treatment of flour is a GRAS ingredient.  The bleached flour has enhanced baking properties.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe facility uses 1-ton cylinders of chlorine. Up to six cylinders of chlorine, with a capacity of one ton each may be stored at any given time.  The maximum weight on chlorine on-site at any time is 12,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nMiller Milling is meeting all applicable state and federal codes and regulations to ensure chlorine safety.  The specific prevention components include:  process safety information, process hazard analyses, operating procedures, training, employer responsibilities for contractors, scheduled preventative maintenance and inspections.  Classroom training is required of all Miller Milling Saginaw facility employees including general employee awareness of the chlorine hazards, as well as specialized training for employees with operation or maintenance responsibilities for the chlorine system.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nMiller Milling will contract chlorine system emergency response to Specialized Response Solutions.  The Miller Milling chlorine system is automated so that operators can shutdown the system immediately and remotely.  Miller Milling is coordinating public communication with Tarrant County and the Saginaw Fire Department."
