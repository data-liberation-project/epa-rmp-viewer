Preventative maintenance programs and systems are in place to reduce the potential for undesirable events.  Emergency response plans and procedures are in place to handle problems if they arise.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) identifies potential release scenarios, safeguards and emergency response procedures.\n\nCVGP: DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\nThe CVGP is located just south of Cotton Valley, LA.  The plant processes natural gas and condensate.  Six systems process the incoming hydrocarbons; inlet separation and compression, condensate stabilization, amine system, dehydration, cryogenic system, and the fractionation train.  Regulated flammable materials in natural gas such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane are present at the plant.  Chemicals are utilized at the gas plant, however the type and quantity at the CVGP are not regulated as toxics under the RMP program.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for both worse case and alternate release scenarios for flammable substances.  The CVGP is considered one process due to the close proximity of process vessels and storage areas.  Therefore, one scenario is presented for a worse case release and one for an alternate scenario release.\n\nWorse Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe WCS for a flammable release was determined to be a vapor cloud explosion of a pentane storage tank.  The safeguards in place to prevent an accidental release from this tank make this release scenario far from probable.  Regardless of the safety systems in place, the release scenario has been developed for the worse case \"what-if\" scenario for the CVGP.  Under the RMP regulations, a WCS for"

      "SummaryText": " flammable substances must consider a vapor cloud explosion event.  An end point based on a one psi overpressure is required.  A vapor cloud explosion involving the pentane tank could possibly affect a 0.56 mile radius around the tank.\n \nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nThe ARS for a flammable release was identified to be a gas release during meter proving operations.  Several safety systems and practices are in place to minimize the risk of a rupture.  A \"what-if\" scenario has been developed for emergency planning purposes.  For the ARS, a 0.15 mile radius around the meter proving location could be affected.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\nThe accident prevention program for the plant is summarized in the following section.  The plant has a process safety management plan (PSM) in place as described in OSHA regulations.  A copy of the PSM manual that describes the program is located at the CVGP.  The PSM plan has been updated to include all accident prevention elements required under RMP regulations. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmployee participation is an important aspect in process safety management.  Three methods are used to involve employees in accident prevention; direct participation, active consultation with affected employees, and anonymous communication to supervisors.  The process safety management program is periodically reviewed in safety meetings and employees have the opportunity to participate on hazard committees.  Specific ways employees participate in the elements of the accident prevention program are described in detail in an Employee Participation Plan located in the CVGP PSM manual.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess safety information is available in hard copy and electronic form at various locations throughout the CVGP.

The operating procedures identify consequences of deviation, and the management of change procedure is used to update this information.  A directory of the various PSM related materials is located in the PSM manual.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA multi-disciplinary team is used to conduct a PHA using a method suitable for the particular scenario.  The hazard analysis includes consideration of offsite consequences to the public and environment.  A study is conducted at least every five years.  The Management of Change procedure is used to address recommendations and the status is reviewed quarterly.  The \"what-if\" questions and answers are located in the CVGP training room for employee review.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures are maintained in a computerized system (TRACCESS) and printed, controlled copies available to all employees in the CVGP training room.  Employees assisted in developing these procedures for tasks performed under normal, startup, and shutdown operations.  A Management of Change form is completed for design or operating changes.  Employees also request changes.  The CVGP Records Processor circulates these change requests to management for approval.  If approved, an employee will be assigned responsibility to update the procedures.  The CVGP Records Processor will update the computer system to reflect the approved changes.  The operating procedures are reviewed annually for content and filing accuracy.\n\nTraining\n\nThe training system is computer based and integrated with the operating procedures.

Documentation is included in the computerized system.  Training relating to various other safety programs are administered and tracked by the HES Department.\n\nContractors\n\nContractors are required to obtain an Access and Work Permit prior to entering the CVGP.  The Access and Work permit documents that the contractor understands emergency procedures, has completed general safety training, has completed a CVGP Site Specific Orientation, has completed pre-job preparation activities, utilizes proper personal protective equipment, and understands CVGP policies specific to safe work.  At the end of the workday, the contractor is to check out with the designated access representative.  The access representative reviews any substances the contractor brings on site to determine RMP applicability.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) are conducted by knowledgeable individuals to confirm that consideration has been given to safety prior to the startup of a process.  PSSRs are required for installation of new equipment, significant modifications to existing equipment or when two or more boxes on the Safety Evaluation Checklist are checked on the Management of Change Form.  The designated Project Coordinator ensures that a PSSR is conducted, develops project specific checklists, establishes a PSSR team if needed, completes the PSSR checklist, documents team participation, and files documentation.\n \nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe mechanical integrity program assures that equipment is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases of flammable materials.  Six separate programs comprise the mechanical integrity program.  The Material Specification, Material Receipt, and Tagging and Recording Procedures are all Quality Assurance Programs.  These progr"

Mechanical Integrity Programs include Corrosion and Erosion Monitoring, Preventive Maintenance, and Maintenance Procedures Programs.  The Corrosion Monitoring program is carried out by certified corrosion experts and includes vessel and piping inspections.  The Preventative Maintenance Program is maintained on a computer- based system.  The system prints weekly work orders for necessary maintenance.  The PSM Records Processor will record completion dates in the computer system.  The Maintenance Procedures Program is also in the computer-based system and includes a training and certification program similar to that previously described under training.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nSeveral safe work practices are in place to insure employee safety.  Hot Work Permits are utilized when performing any task that could create a spark.  Confined Space Entry Permits are utilized when employees work in areas with limited egress, unfavorable ventilation, or which is not intended for continuous employee occupancy.  The Lock Out/Tag Out Program ensures that all sources of stored energy are locked out and/or tagged out before work begins.  All of these programs are described in detail in Marathon Region Policies.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe management of change policy is a means to request, document, evaluate, and authorize all design and operating changes to ensure that they have been fully reviewed for undue risk in safety, health, operability, maintainability, environmental, and offsite areas.  Design change includes any permanent or temporary installation of equipment.  Operating changes are changes that require altered operating procedures and/or operating limits.  A Management of Change form must be completed prior to beginning work that involves design or operating changes.  This form is reviewed by CVG"
