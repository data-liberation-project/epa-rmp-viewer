      "SummaryText": "We are a fertilizer retail facility.  The only material considered hazardous at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Our facility has one 12,000 gallon tank, equipment for receiving ammonia by truck and equipment for transferring ammonia from storage to nurse tanks.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose or line breaks.\n2. A pressure relief valve on the storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.\n3. Inspections by insurance company inspectors to ensure that our equipment is maintained in a manner that ensures safe operation and prevents releases.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures. We have also coordinated with the Texico and Farwell Volunteer Fire Departments to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the effect from this scenario would extend 1.8 miles from our facility, and would affect the cities of Farwell and Texico, their schools, parks and commercial areas.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA\u0012s worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the effect from such a release would only extend 2000 feet and would affect some residences in Texico and the Texico high school."
