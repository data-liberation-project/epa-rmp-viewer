This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes.  Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Colt R&D Track Y-Grade NGL Transloading Operation is a Y-Grade NGL transloading facility. Approximately 6,000 bbls/day of Y-Grade Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) are loaded from trucks to rail tank cars utilizing portable trailer-mounted transloading units. Operations expects there to be 20 loaded rail tank cars located on the R&D spur onsite any given day. \r\n\r\nThe loaded interconnected rail tank cars fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68 while disconnected from a means of transportation (i.e. locotmotive). The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Flammable Mixture (NGL).\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\r\n\r\nProcesses at the Colt R&D Track Y-Grade NGL Transloading Operation are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program 1 (RMP) regulation.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information\r\n\r\nThe Colt R&D Track Y-Grade NGL Transloading Operation maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally relea"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. Crestwood and the BNSF Railroad maintain active Chemical Transportation Emergency Center (CHEMTREC) accounts to coordinate and assist first responders with the response protocol for transportation related HazMat emergencies. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Colt R&D Track Y-Grade NGL Transloading Operation is coordinated with the Epping Rural Fire Protection District. The contact for the Epping Rural Fire Protection District is (701-859-5561). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Colt R&D Track Y-Grade NGL Transloading Operation has around-the-clock communications capability. Crestwood operators are required to be onsite to monitor all product transfers. In the event of a process upset, An operator will call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Epping Rural Fire Protection District). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Crestwood conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Colt R&D Track Y-Grade NGL Transloading Operation performs annual drills with local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nFive - Year Accident History\r\n\r\nColt R&D Track Y-Grade NGL"
