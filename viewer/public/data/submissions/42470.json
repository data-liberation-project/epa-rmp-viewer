      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nThis document is an update to the Pyramid Peak Water Treatment Plant (PPWTP) Risk Management Program (RMP) that was submitted to U.S. EPA in May 1999.   In accordance with RMP guidance documents and regulations, all administrative and operational changes at the facility since 1999 are documented.\n\nIn June 1996, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued Risk Management (RM) program regulations (40 CFR, Part 68).  Regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), the RMP requires facilities that store large amounts of listed hazardous chemical substances to prepare and implement risk management plans to reduce the probability of accidental releases and minimize the health risks to the public and the environment.  \n\nThe RMP regulates 77 listed toxic substances and 63 listed flammable substances.  Of the 140 toxic and flammable chemicals regulated by the RMP, the PPWTP has only one such listed chemical, anhydrous chlorine, which is used to disinfect drinking water provided to the residents of Glendale.  The terms anhydrous chlorine and chlorine are used interchangeably and specifically refer to a chemical listed in the RMP regulations.  When used as a disinfectant, chlorine prevents the spread of waterborne diseases and has been used for years in the water treatment industry.  When properly used, chlorine has proven to be both safe and effective. \n\nIn addition to the PPWTP, the RMP regulations apply to an estimated 7,200 public and private drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities nationwide where chlorine and/or ammonia are used as disinfectants.  As with other facilities across the U.S., the City of Glendale views the RMP as a vehicle to communicate emergency response procedures to the public and emergency planning agencies.  \n\nMinimizing Risk\nThe major driving force in the development of the RMP regulations is reducing the risk to public health by minimizing the potential of a chemical release.  At PPWTP, th"

      "SummaryText": "ere is a multi-layer system in place to meet this goal.  The RMP includes the following: (1) properly trained operators to safely handle chlorine; (2) chlorine detectors located where chlorine is stored and/or used; (3) failsafe equipment design and installation of back-up safety equipment including emergency scrubbers; and (4) an automated warning system that notifies both on-site and off-site personnel of a potential release.  Trained personnel respond to chlorine alarms to assess whether a chlorine release poses an imminent danger to employees or the public.  While a significant release is unlikely, emergency response plans have been developed for just such an occurrence.  The emergency response plans include procedures to be followed by operators trained to take appropriate action including contacting the Glendale Fire Department (GFD).  The GFD?s emergency response time to the PPWTP is 10 minutes.\n\nManagement Plan\nWithin the management and administrative roles of the PPWTP, responsibility has been defined to coordinate and implement the RMP.  Overall development and management of the RMP is the responsibility of the RMP Manager.  The RMP Coordinator reports to the RMP Manager and is responsible for coordinating the implementation of the RMP.  The PPWTP Safety Administrator is responsible for the overall recordkeeping of the RMP (and assisting the RMP Coordinator).  The Senior Operator is responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the RMP and reports to the RMP Manager.  Additional program oversight is provided by the City of Glendale?s Environmental Resource Administrator and Employee Safety Manager who act as external auditors of the program?s implementation and overall quality.\n\nFor the PPWTP, the following personnel have been assigned to coordinate and implement the RMP:\n\n?    The Superintendent of Plant Operations is the designated RMP Manager\n?    The Safety & Security coordinator is the designated RMP Coordinator\n\nThe Safety and Security Coordinator is al"

The requirements of the PSM program largely parallel RMP requirements.  Because of the similarities in the two programs, the RMP Coordinator will be referred to as the RM/PSM Program Coordinator throughout this document.\n\n5-Year Accident History\nSince PPWTP opened in 1986, there has not been a release resulting in off-site property damage or health consequences requiring medical treatment. \n\nChemical Release Prevention Program\nThe PPWTP has a chemical release prevention program in place for the chlorine process.  This program is required by both the RMP and OSHA PSM regulations.  The prevention program for the chlorine process has been in place since 1995.  Key provisions of the PPWTP prevention program are as follows:\n\n?    Written procedures have been prepared for the covered process, including directions for safe start-up and shutdown operations and emergency shutdown.\n\n?    PPWTP employees who operate the chlorine system must receive training initially and periodically on safe start-up and shutdown operations and emergency shutdown.  \n\n?    Incidences, including minor releases are investigated to improve the safety of the process.  \n\n?    Once completed, incident investigations are shared with employees.  \n\n?    Employees participate in a process hazard analysis (PHA) which identifies potential hazards and ways to improve the safety of the process every five years, or when significant changes are made to the process.\n\n?    The PPWTP has a management of change (MOC) program in place that mandates changes to the chlorine system are reviewed prior to the change to ensure that the change will not compromise safety.\n\n?    An equipment design and maintenance program is in place that assures mechanical integrity.  Equipment design and maintenance practices are consistent with guidance provided by the Chlorine Safety Institute.\n\n?    A preliminar"

A hot work permit program is in place. \n\n?    Contractors who work on or near the RMP process are advised of the hazards of chlorine, provided evacuation instructions in case an incident occurs, and must certify that they are qualified to work near hazardous materials.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe PPWTP has an emergency response program in place for the chlorine process.  This program consists of personnel trained to recognize releases, assess the situation, and engage the proper emergency response personnel.  When external emergency response is required, plant personnel will notify the GFD then establish an incident command system that is transferred to the GFD upon their arrival. Once GFD establishes command, it is supported by PPWTP personnel familiar with the affected process.  The GFD has access to additional emergency response resources, including the City of Glendale Police Department, Red Cross, Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, and other agencies, as needed.\n\nImprovements Since Last Report Submission\nThe PPWTP updated its Process Safety Management for chlorine based on the results of a January 2003 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).   The recent PHA validated  previous PHA findings and confirms that human error is the greatest potential hazard at PPWTP."
