      "SummaryText": "The City of Deerfield Beach (City) has developed a Process Safety / Risk Management Program for control of catastrophic releases of extremely hazardous substances at its west water treatment plant (WTP) in Deerfield Beach, Florida.  This program continues the City\u00bfs commitment to the protection of its employees and the control of the potential for such a release.  To date, no such release has ever occurred at the plant.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\nOSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119, as cited by the Florida Department of Employment) and USEPA\u00bfs Chemical Accident Prevention rule (40 CFR 68) require a risk management program.  The OSHA standard applies to any process that involves more than 1,500 pounds of chlorine.  USEPA\u00bfs rule applies to any process that involves more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine.  This program applies to the use of chlorine for disinfection of water at this WTP, because the plant intends to store up to 30 tons of chlorine onsite.   \n\nAlthough the west WTP uses ammonia in its operation, the quantity present is lower than the 10,000 pound threshold quantity established by OSHA and USEPA.  At 30\u00baF, the ammonia inventory would be:\n\n1,000 gallons * 5.34 #/gal = 5,340 pounds\n\nAlhtough this quantity is far below the OSHA and USEPA thresholds, ammonia will be discussed in this risk management plan. \n \nProgram Summary\nThe programs described in this Risk Management Plan supplement the procedures described in other City of Deerfield Beach  documents such as general administrative guidelines and safety and health manuals.  The Plan addresses Deerfield Beach \u00bfs program management procedures, process safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, employee training, safe work practices, and emergency response.  Each topic has its own section in this program document.\n\nProgram Management\nThe City has concluded that systematic management policies, procedures, and practices are fundamental to minimizing the possibility of chemical re"

The Program Management procedures described in this Plan consist of the following elements:\n\n- Definition of Roles and Responsibilities\n- Employee Participation\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Management of Change Procedures\n- Incident Investigation\n- Inspection and Compliance Audits\n- Program Maintenance\n\nProcess Safety Information\nChlorine is currently used at the West WTP as a disinfection agent to meet Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.  Chlorine can be added to the treatment process in either the raw water, the filter inlet, or the filter outlet.  Chlorine is stored onsite within 30 1-ton pressurized cylinders, and is conveyed under vacuum into high pressure service water by means of two vacuum ejectors.  The process safety information described in this Plan consists of the following:  \n\n- Chlorine Hazards and Physical Data\n- Process Description and Technology\n- Process Chemistry\n- Material and Energy Balance\n- Chemical Quality and Inventory\n- Safe Upper and Lower Operating Limits\n- Process Equipment Descriptions\n\nTraining\nDeerfield Beach  has implemented a training program with guidelines for conducting regular, structured plant training for Deerfield Beach  employees.  Training record forms document the required training.  The training records for all personnel associated with the covered processes appear in the training file kept at the plant.\n\nOperating Procedures\nDeerfield Beach  has adopted standard operating procedures (SOPs) that provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine systems.  The procedures, presented in Section 6, address startup, shutdown, inspections, temporary operation, emergency procedures, and troubleshooting.  Maintenance SOPs appear in Section 7, along with other safe work practices for handling chlorine and working in and around chlorine facilities.\n\nEmergency Response Procedure\nAn Emergency Response Procedure documents the measures Deerfield Beach"

The emergency response procedures therefore focus on keeping the employees away from dangerous areas, while the mechanical equipment and contract emergency services control the chemical release.  The Emergency Response Procedures consist of the following elements:\n\n- Recognition of a release\n- Notification of Authorities\n- Shutdown Procedures and Emergency Plant Operation\n- Release Control and Mitigation\n- Evacuation Plan\n- Medical Emergencies\n- Written Reports\n\nProcess Hazard Review\nThe City conducted a hazard review for each regulated process.  The hazard review team consisted of plant management, process operation and maintenance experts, outside process design engineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the hazard review process itself."
