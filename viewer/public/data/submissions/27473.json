(PFI), Lost Hills Facility (Facility) at 13646 Highway 33, Lost Hills, CA 93249 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of chlorine, methyl bromide, and aluminum phosphide.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, people, and the environment.  An emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Description of the Stationary Source\n\nPistachio processing operations at the Lost Hills Facility consists of multiple hulling and drying operations, over 100 drying and storage silos, and various classifying, roasting and packaging operations.  The almond processing operations includes precleaning lines, classification operations, combination hulling and shelling lines, size grading and color sorting lines, hand sorting lines, blanching operations, and packaging lines.  A water treatment plant at the Facility provides process water for the pistachio processing operations, the almond blanching operations, the boilers, and state certified potable water for the facility.\n\nSupply water for the water treatment plant is stored in a freshwater pond located approximately 650 yards east of the Facility.  Water is piped from the freshwater pond to an adjacent sand filtering plant and chlorination plant where it is injected with gaseous chlorine.  The water then travels through approximately 1 mile of piping to storage tanks located next to the water treatment plant.  Gaseous chlorine is utilized in the disinfection, primarily bacterial and viral destruction, of the process water.  Disinfection of the process water is achieved by withdrawing a metered volume of gaseous chlorine from one-ton cylinders, and injecting the chlori"

Normally, two one-ton cylinders are connected to the chlorine injection system; however, the operational design of the system allows only one cylinder to be in service at a time.  Typically, two additional one-ton cylinders are stored at the chlorination plant.\n\nThe integral components of the chlorine injection system are two automatic switchover vacuum regulators (one on each cylinder), a stand-by pressure release (vent) valve, a manual adjusting valve with flow rate indicator, and a chlorine ejector assembly.  The vacuum regulators and manual adjusting valve meter the gas under vacuum and the ejector assembly creates the vacuum and mixes the gas with the water for transport and application.  No portion of the chlorine injection system is pressurized; the system in under vacuum from the ejector to the vacuum regulators located on the chlorine cylinders.\n\nAdditional regulated substances are handled at the Facility; however, the regulated substances are handled in quantities below the federal threshold planning quantity.\n\n3.  Chemicals Subject to EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPFI uses chlorine at the Lost Hills Facility in quantities large enough to trigger both California?s Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) and the EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Program.  PFI also handles methyl bromide and aluminum phosphide at the Lost Hills Facility in quantities large enough to trigger California?s Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  Chlorine is transported to the facility by truck, stored onsite in one-ton cylinders, and used for water disinfection.  Methyl bromide is transported to the facility by truck, stored onsite in 175-pound cylinders, and used for fumigation.  Aluminum phosphide is transported to the facility by truck, stored onsite in 3.3-pound aluminum flasks, and used for fumigation.\n\n4.  Worst-Case Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\na.

      "SummaryText": "nd Alternative Release Scenarios\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nAnhydrous liquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as liquid under pressure) is imported to the site by truck and stored in one-ton cylinders.  The worst-case release scenario assumes that the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder is emitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of calm winds and stagnant atmospheric conditions (1.5 meters/second wind speed and F atmospheric stability).  The Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) modeling program was used to estimate the downwind impacts for a one-ton chlorine release.  Rural surface roughness conditions were utilized to account for the relatively open land in the vicinity of the Facility.  The ALOHA modeling program estimated the gas chlorine cloud would travel 3.0 miles before dispersing below the 3 ppm toxic endpoint concentration.\n\nThe estimated residential population within a 3.0 mile radius of the chlorination plant is 5 people.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\nThe PHA team selected the following hypothetical situation as the alternate release scenario: during cylinder change-out or while in operation, the valve connection between the cylinder and vacuum regulator begins to leak.  The Handbook of Chlorination states that a chlorine withdrawal rate in excess 0.28 lb/min (400 lb/day) for a one-ton cylinder at 68 oF will lead to a cooling of the system and potential freezing of the cylinder.  However, for the purpose of this evaluation, a release rate of 0.6 lb/min was utilized.  It was also assumed that the leak would be repaired within 60 minutes.\n\nEPA suggested alternative release scenario parameters of 3.0 meters/second wind speed and D atmospheric stability were utilized.  The ALOHA modeling program estimated the gas chlorine cloud would travel 219 yards before dispersing below the 3 ppm toxic endpoint concentration.\n\nThe residential population within a 219 yard radius of the chlorination plant is 0 people.\n\n5.

      "SummaryText": "gement Accident Prevention Program\n\nThe chlorination plant at the Lost Hills Facility is subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with chlorine storage and the chlorine injection system.  PFI?s PSM program includes the following stringent activities to minimize the potential accidental release:\n\n? Review of the design of all equipment and controls associated with the chlorine injection system to ensure they are properly designed and installed;\n? Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for appropriate personnel;\n? Procedures to ensure that all contractors have received safety training;\n? Periodic inspections of all equipment and controls, with stringent documentation of all inspections;\n? Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspectors;\n? Pre-startup safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified;\n? Stringent investigation of any incidents that have a potential to have caused chlorine releases;\n? Periodic evaluation of safety records of all outside contractors who work on the RMP/PSM-regulated systems;\n? Development of an effective emergency response program;\n? Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all appropriate staff are aware of the PSM program, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues; and\n? Independent audits of the PSM and RMP programs every three years.\n\nMethyl bromide is handled at the Facility is quantities that exceed the OSHA PSM threshold.  However, since the methyl bromide is stored in 175 lb cylinders, a release involving 2,500 lbs of methyl bromide is unlikely and; therefore, methyl bromide has not been included in the PSM portion of this RMP/PSM.\n\n6.

Emergency Response Program\n\nPFI utilized its Emergency Response Plan to provide procedures for emergency response in the unlikely event of an accidental release.  The emergency response plan was written in accordance with the following regulations: Section 1910.38 of CFR Title 29, Section 5189 of CCR Title 8, and Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code.\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on recent safety reviews that were conducted as part of the evaluations for CalARP, the EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Program, and OSHA?s PSM Program, PFI has implemented the following actions to either reduce the likelihood of severity of potential chemical releases:\n\n? Improve site security:  PFI is proceeding with the installation of a chain-link fence, with a locked gate, around the chlorination plant.\n? Improve traffic protections:  PFI is proceeding with the installation of a vehicle barrier system around the portions of the chlorination plant that is susceptible to vehicular impact."
