The facility implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of anhydrous ammonia and has not had nor does it anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances [40 CFR 68.155(b)]\n\nActagro operates a crop nutrient manufacturing facility which utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a raw material. The manufacturing process begins with leonardite (a soft coal rich in humin fractions) which is chemically reacted with anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and the organic acids found in the leonardite to develop mixed grade fertilizers used in the production of crop nutrients for resale.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in two (2) 12,000 gallon above ground bullet storage tanks at the site with the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored on location is limited to 80% level of the storage bullet tanks, or 99,300 pounds.\n\n\n\nThere are no listed flammable substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]\n\nThe Osceola facility is subject to the EPA Chemical Accident P"

The facility complies with the Program 3 requirements of EPA's RMP rule through the implementation of the OSHA PSM Program. The PSM prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n? Employee Participation: This program involves the employees, in participation in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program ensures employees have complete access to the program.\n\n? Process Safety Information (PSI): Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the process. The written information includes SDS's and a description of the design of the anhydrous ammonia containing process.\n\n? Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): Formal studies using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) methodology have been conducted to look at the process and identify potential hazards.\n\n? Operating Procedures: Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the anhydrous ammonia process.\n\n? Employee Training: A training program has been developed which ensures employees are trained on aspects of the process and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the anhydrous ammonia process.\n\n? Contractor Safety: Contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the anhydrous ammonia process. The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure they follow safe-work practices.\n\n? Pre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is completed for new anhydrous ammonia project"

Hot Work Permit: The facility has developed and implemented procedures to ensure a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning activities.\n\n? Management of Change: The facility has developed and implemented a Management of Change (MOC) program to ensure changes made to the anhydrous ammonia process are properly reviewed.\n\n? Incident Investigation: The facility has developed and implemented procedures to ensure incidents (and near misses) involving the anhydrous ammonia process are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\n\n? Compliance Audits: The facility conducts audits of the prevention program every 3 years (or sooner if needed) to ensure the program is in place and working properly.\n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History [40 CFR 68.155(d)]\n\nThe Actagro Osceola facility has no history of releases of listed Hazardous Substances which have resulted in offsite effects.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]\n\nActagro maintains an Emergency Action Plan, in lieu of an Emergency Response Program.
