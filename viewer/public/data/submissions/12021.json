A covered\nfacility is one that stores any of a long list of dangerous chemicals (e.g., chemicals that are either\ntoxic, flammable, or explosive), in quantities greater than the threshold levels listed in the Rule. \nListed toxic chemicals and their respective threshold quantities can be found in the Federal\nRegulations at 40 CFR 68.\n     The stationary (potential) source that is addressed herein is the City of Gretna's Wastewater\nTreatment Plant.  The Plant's location is identified as follows:\n\n                                   1) Street Address:       1100 Burmaster Street\n                         Gretna, LA 70053\n\n                                        2) Geographical Location:     29o55'54\" North Latitude\n                         90o02'40\" West Longitude\n\n\n     Chlorine gas, an air toxic chemical, is listed.  Chlorine is used by most water treatment and\nwastewater treatment plants as a disinfectant.  The threshold quantity listed for chlorine is 2,500\npounds.  The City of Gretna's wastewater treatment plant stores chlorine gas in quantities that\nexceeds the  threshold quantity and, as a result, is a covered facility.  Accordingly, the City of Gretna\nhas employed a consultant to conduct a Program 2 Hazard Review,"

The consultant, EPL, Inc., also is preparing written\nSafety, O&M, and Emergency Response Plans for the safe handling of the toxic gas, as required by\nthe USEPA.  \n     It is pertinent to note, however, that the City of Gretna's wastewater treatment plant has been\nin continuous operation for more than 25 years.  During that long operational history, there has never\nbeen a release of chlorine gas of such a magnitude so as to cause injury to people, pets or property\nsurrounding the water treatment plant.  \n     Pure chlorine gas (an air toxic), used to disinfect the City's treated wastewater, is received\nand stored at the above location in the form of a gas that is liquified under pressure.  The liquified\nchlorine gas is supplied in steel pressure cylinders that contain one ton (2000 lbs) of chlorine when\nreceived.  Typical inventory of chlorine at the Gretna wastewater treatment plant is six ton cylinders. \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\"Worst-Case\" Scenario \n     The USEPA regulations require an assessment of risk and emergency response planning for\naccidental release of any of the listed air toxics under two (or more) different scenarios.  That is, the\nregulations call for analysis/planning for a \"worst-case\" scenario based on rigid scenario conditions\nfor any air toxic.  These \"worst-case\" scenario - required conditions are identified as follows:\n\n                                                       Release Duration                   10 minutes\n                                                            Quantity of Air Toxic Released          2000 lbs\n                                                       Release Rate                       200 lbs/min\n                                                                 Endpoint Toxic Concentration (safe level)    0.0087 mg/l\n                                                  Windspeed                     1.5 M/sec (3.36 mph)"

The resulting risk area for this \"worst-case\" scenario was determined from the\nUSEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants for the Gretna\nwastewater treatment plant.  For an urban setting, such as is the condition at the Gretna wastewater\ntreatment plant, the distance to the endpoint (or safe exposure distance) is listed in Exhibit 4-12 in\nthe Guidance document as a 1.3 miles radius around the wastewater treatment plant.\n     Additionally, the USEPA regulations provide for consideration of passive mitigation in\n\"worst-case\" assessments.  Enclosure of air toxic containers/feed systems within a building is\nconsidered a valid, passive mitigation condition.  Passive mitigation presence provides for a toxic\ngas release area reduction of 45 percent (i.e., by multiplying the model \"worst-case\" radius by a\nfactor of 0.55).  Thus, the USEPA's model endpoint for chlorine is reduced for the Gretna\nwastewater treatment plant as follows:\n\n                                             1.3 miles x 0.55    =    0.72 miles (\"worst-case\" release area)\n\nAlternative Scenario\n     The regulations also permit planners to provide one or more realistic, alternative scenarios\ninvolving accidental release of air toxics.

      "SummaryText": "water treatment plant was based on a tubing failure, a bad connection or valve failure resulting\nin the release of chlorine gas through a 5/16 inch-diameter whole or opening in a ton cylinder.  \n     This scenario was modeled by the USEPA study, (see Exhibit 4-15 in the Guidance\ndocument) and produced the following information.  The release described above would last for 60\nminutes with an average maximum gas flow rate of 15 lbs/min.  Again, for an urban setting, the\nrelease impact area, i.e., the distance from the source out to the endpoint concentration for chlorine\n(0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm) was found to be 0.1 miles, without consideration of the passive mitigation\nfactor.  When we adapted the model's result to include the containment of the gas inside the\ntreatment plant, the endpoint distance is further reduced by 45 percent to 0.06 miles (317 feet).\n     Further, while only passive mitigation can be considered for the \"worst-case\" scenario, the\nregulations permit inclusion of active mitigation factor(s) for the alternative scenario modeling that\ncan further reduce the estimated toxic gas spread area (i.e., distance to endpoint).  The active\nmitigation system to be installed at the City of Gretna's wastewater treatment plant is an air\nscrubbing system that will remove chlorine gas from the air.  An alarm signal from the existing\nchlorine leak detector will be used to automatically trigger start-up of the air scrubbing system in the\nevent of a leak.   It is conservatively estimated, based on the effectiveness of the air scrubber system,\nthat at least 90 percent of a chlorine release can be removed from the air by this system.  Thus, as\npart of this alternative scenario, the endpoint distance is further reduced to about 0.006 miles (or\nabout 32 feet).  In this case, there would be no release to any public receptors off-site.\n     The City has developed a toxic gas release Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that is\napplicable to both the City's Water and Wastewater Treatme"
