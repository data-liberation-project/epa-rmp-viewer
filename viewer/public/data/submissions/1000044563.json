The facility was built in 1972 and was historically owned/operated by Kraft Foods, Kellogg's Company and Aurora Foods. The Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") program was developed for the facility in 1994/1995 under Kraft. The original Risk Management Program was developed by Kellogg's using the existing PSM and the initial Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") was submitted to EPA on June 18, 1999.  Aurora Foods Corporation purchased the facility in November 1999.  Aurora emerged bankruptcy in March 2004, survived a merger and was renamed Pinnacle Foods Group LLC. \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nPinnacle is committed to providing a safe workplace that is operated in an environmentally responsible manner. Pinnacle strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment. Pinnacle is also committed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to safety in the workplace and the protection of the environment.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\r\n\r\nIt is Pinnacle Foods Group LLC policy that we will promote overall public and associate safety by developing, implementing and maintaining all required elements of the EPA's RMP provisions and OSHA's PSM standard regarding the storage, handling, and processing of anhydrous ammonia used at this facility.  The incorporation of these programs helps to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of cat"

The Facility's Plant Manager is responsible for the implementation of the RMP.  In turn, he has designated the facility EHS Manager as PSM coordinator having overall authority for, and oversight of, the Facility RMP. As part of the PSM and Risk Management Program, the Facility has an Emergency Response Plan and Procedures Manual which provides instructions and responsibilities required of all facility personnel in case of the following plant emergencies: employee illness/injury, ammonia release, fire, and severe weather. The manual also provides procedures and responsibilities for controlled and emergency shutdowns of facility equipment. The management team is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures at the Pinnacle facility.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe facility is located on 56 acres northwest of Mattoon in southeast Illinois.  The facility consists of one building with over 212,000 square feet under roof. The primary purpose of our facility is the production of bagels, both fresh and frozen.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers anhydrous ammonia hazardous; therefore, the properties, which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant, also necessitate certain safety precautions.  A nationally recognized, reputable and professional ammonia delivery company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Steel piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance (toxic or flammable) used at our facility.  We operate two separate but co-located re"

The system was designed and constructed to meet the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Fire Code, ASHRAE Standard 15 and the National Electrical Code.  Shut-off valves are strategically located throughout the refrigeration system to allow emergency shut-off, periodic maintenance and repair.  Depending on location and use in the system, pressure vessels are ASME rated and fitted with either a single or dual safety relief valve as required by ASME.\r\n\r\nThe Pinnacle Foods Group LLC facility complies with applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Operators/Mechanics receive a combination of classroom training plus On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are given written tests and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge. \r\n\r\nPinnacle has reviewed and revised the documents and procedures for compliance with OSHA's PSM and EPA's Risk Management Program for ammonia use and storage.

Our emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.   If a release of ammonia is detected by the ADS or by employees, the procedures within this manual will be followed including notification of hazardous materials responders (refrigeration mechanics) by radio and as required, the involvement of the incident commander. The manual describes the level of personnel protective equipment to be used to respond to ammonia incidents.  Facility responders have received initial and annual refresher training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.  Facility-wide training regarding emergency procedures and evacuation routes occurs on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nPinnacle has an in-house HAZMAT team that initially responds and works in conjunction the Cole County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Mattoon Fire Department and HAZMAT team on emergency preparedness.  The Fire Department and Police will handle public notification, under the control of the LEPC.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns. Pinnacle will work with these agencies as necessary to notify the public about an ammonia release. The manual also contains procedures for emergency alerting and response procedures for on-site personnel, off-site emergency contacts, and adjacent plants.  Senior management will handle Media relations.\r\n\r\nWe strive to minimize off-site consequences through the implementation of emergency response program elements:  pre-emergency planning, facility evacuation procedures, emergency response procedures, emergency medical and first aid procedures, post-emergency guidelines, and training program.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nCurrently,"
