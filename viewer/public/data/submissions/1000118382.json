The Batesville Generating Station is located at 200 Industrial Drive in Panola County, Batesville, Mississippi 38606. The facility utilizes aqueous ammonia (29% concentration) for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process occurring within the facility\u0092s gas turbine exhaust streams. The ammonia is stored in a 13,677-gallon welded steel tank, but the facility actively maintains a maximum of 8,982 gallons within the tank to stay below the EPA ammonia quantity threshold. However, due to the increasing impairment of ammonia transport during winter storms through past years, the facility plans to increase ammonia storage to the near-full capacity of the tank (13,000 gallons)\nto provide sufficient supply for the site year-round.\n\nIn order to uphold safe and consistent use of ammonia on site, Cooperative Energy maintains\ncomprehensive guideline documents for its employees outlining the proper storage, use, handling, and ordering/receiving procedures for ammonia. These procedures also encompass loading/unloading operations conducted by the ammonia supplier (see Table 1). Employees are regularly trained on these practices as well as the potential dangers associated with ammonia.\n\nAmmonia is ordered on an as-needed basis (when the tank ammonia level has been reduced below 3,000 gallons), and the delivery date and time are requested at the time of the order. Employees conduct proper procedures when ammonia is delivered to the site and supervise the loading/unloading of ammonia as specified in the ammonia guideline documents. A facility Operator or Lab Personnel is present for unloading operations wearing the facility-required PPE for ammonia. These procedures are adopted as company policy and are based on the manufacturer's recommendations. Employees also review operating procedures and maintenance tasks daily, or as needed"

All components\nof the ammonia system are visually inspected at least daily. When maintenance is conducted on the ammonia system, certified personnel oversee and approve the proper installation of materials. Any change in maintenance procedures is reviewed and approved by the same operator. All operators at this facility are knowledgeable in the proper start-up and shut-down procedures for the ammonia system.\n\nCooperative Energy currently has in place a facility emergency action plan encompassing a variety of emergency scenarios. In conjunction with this plan and as required under EPA RMP regulation, Cooperative Energy has also developed an Emergency Response (Action) Plan for response to a potential ammonia leak/spill event.\n\nCooperative Energy\u0092s emergency response (action) plan was developed with the assistance of FC&E Engineering and in coordination with the Panola County LEPC, Batesville Fire Department and the Panola County Emergency Management Agency. Although there have been no accidental releases of ammonia from the Cooperative Energy Batesville Generating Station in the past five (5) years, the risk of a release is always present. If an ammonia release occurs at the facility, the ammonia detection system will activate an audible alarm to the control room and display it on the DCIS operator interface stations. The facility operator detecting the alarm will notify the appropriate Cooperative Energy personnel (as described in the site\u0092s emergency action plan) who will get personnel organized for an emergency action. Due to the dangerous properties of ammonia, and the proximity of emergency response agencies, Cooperative Energy designates itself as a non-responding facility and relies on the assistance of public emergency responders as well as private emergency contractors to respond to and contain ammonia releases.

Public coordination, training exercises, and emergency action procedures associated with the emergency response plan are outlined in the site\u0092s Risk Management Plan.\n\n\nPrevention Program Description\n\nThe Cooperative Energy Batesville Generating Station is an electric power distribution company that falls under NAICS Code 221122 (SIC Code 4911). The last review and update of the safety information for this facility was performed on May 29, 2024. EPA\u0092s Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) Risk Management Program and applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards have been implemented through written policy and procedure manuals. Since Cooperative Energy uses ammonia with less than a 44% ammonia concentration, they are not required to adhere to the OSHA PSM standards, and as such, fall under the regulations of Prevention Program Level 2.\n\nThis facility operates the ammonia injection system utilizing a Distributed Control and Information System (DCIS) providing accurate, real-time information to the control room operators on the status of the entirety of the ammonia system. The DCIS controls the rate of ammonia injection based on signals from the heat recovery steam generators, the combustion turbine, and the Emissions Sampling and Analysis System (SAA). The ammonia system is equipped with multiple safety features including leak detection, overload and short-circuit protection, vacuum/pressure relief valves, and SCR catalyst temperature protection. The ammonia detection system triggers an audible alarm in the control room in the case of an abnormal change in pressure or flow. Site personnel are alerted via control room operators\u0092 radios in the case of an emergency. The site is fenced and gated, and access to the site is restricted to authorized Cooperative Energy employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors."
