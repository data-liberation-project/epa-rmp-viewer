This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe James River Plant manufactures and processes specialty chemicals in Chesterfield County, Virginia.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are in use at the site.\r\n\r\nThe James River Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity established by the U.S. EPA.  Based on process knowledge, Chemours identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses oleum, which is the only regulated substances in the process.\r\n\r\nBased on worst-case analyses, the distances to endpoints [i.e. Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association] do not exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public).  In addition, the James River facility has had no accidents with off-site impact over the last five years and has coordinated with the local emergency responders.  Therefore, the sulfuric acid process is classified as Program 1 under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\r\n\r\nJames River is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM).

Chemours James River Plant does not store any flammable substances listed in the rule in the threshold quantities required by the regulation; therefore, Chemours does not have a worst-case scenario for flammable substances.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints). Oleum is the only regulated toxic substance at the James River Plant. \r\n\r\nFor the 20% oleum storage vessel, passive mitigation exists and was considered in calculating air emissions.  The product from the oleum storage tank will be kept in a containment area which will contain the entire contents of the tank.  Administrative controls are also in place which allow for filling to 90% of the tank capacity.  High level alarms are also in place to ensure this control.  In addition, an automatic overflow into another vessel assures less than 90% of the tank capacity.\r\n\r\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint resulting from the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the oleum tank remains on-site and does not effect any public receptors.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated based on the U.S. EPA lookup tables contained in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Document.\r\n\r\nAlternative Releases\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fenceline.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the James River Plant's accident prevention program. One way that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is our Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) Committee.   In addition,  James River has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams have members from all areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe James River Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the sulfuric acid process area, James River has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature level, composition) as part of the Operating Procedures.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using state-of-the-art process controls and monitoring instruments, emergency relief systems, redundant power supply and safety systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \r\n\r\nJames River has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, James River periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  A \"Job Cycle Check\" program has also been implemented.  This involves a yearly review of specific operating tasks by all operating personnel assigned to those tasks.  All of this training is documented for each operator.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nJames River uses contractors to supplement its workforce.

Plant personnel periodically monitor and audit contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n \r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \r\n\r\nJames River conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nJames River has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
