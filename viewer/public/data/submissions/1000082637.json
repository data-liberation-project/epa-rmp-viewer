The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nArmstrong Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nTr"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nArmstrong Gas Plant conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information.

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n * A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n * A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\r\n * An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n * A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n * An overview of our emergency response program\r\n * An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Armstrong Gas Plant located in DeWitt County, Texas is owned by Enterprise Hydrocarbons, LLC and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\r\n\r\nThe Armstrong Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of a two-train cryogenic natural gas liquid recovery plant and natural gas liquids fractionation equipment.  The natural gas liquid recovery units are designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and are assembled primarily from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components.

      "SummaryText": "inlet gas pipelines.  The plant processes the gas utilizing a cryogenic turboexpander to remove recoverable natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.  These mixed hydrocarbon liquids are fractionated at the Armstrong facility into individual, purified ethane, propane, mixed butane and pentane-plus natural gas liquid streams.  Finished products are residual natural gas from the cryogenic plant and fractionated hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems and, in the case of the propane, mixed butane and pentane-plus liquids, also by tractor trailer trucks.\r\n\r\nThe Armstrong Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.  Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Armstrong Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and mixed pentanes.  Armstrong Plant operating technicians also attend a natural gas treating plant located across a two-lane highway from the liquid extraction, fractionation and hydrocarbon liquid storage facilities.  This gas treating plant handles naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures which are exempt from the RMP regulation. Liquid gas condensate is also stored at the location, but is also a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture and is exempt from the RMP regulation.  Ethyl mercaptan is also stored at the facility for tank truck odorizing use, but is kept below the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation. The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 1 site under the EPA RMP program.  \r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.
