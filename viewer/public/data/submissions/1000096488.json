Disinfecting the water supply is accomplished through the use of chlorine gas. The disinfection process requires approximately 150 pounds of chlorine per day. The Painesville plant has storage capacity for 15 one-ton chlorine cylinders and typically stores nine (9) full cylinders on-site. \n\n\n\nWorst-case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario is failure of a one-ton chlorine container. This scenario involves compromising a one-ton cylinder by severe impact. This can occur while lifting the cylinder from the ground level storage area to the chlorine feed room by hoist and monorail. The facility is located in a populated area and a chlorine plume could reach residents in the nearby area. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a hose or valve failure during the switchover of one of the chlorine containers. This can occur if the operator, while switching the container, is not careful to properly seat the vacuum regulator on the one-ton chlorine cylinder. The alternative release scenario would most likely remain on site within the chlorine feed room. Both scenarios were evaluated using the modeling program RMP* COMP.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year History:\n\n\n\nThere have been zero (0) accidental releases of chlorine in the last ten years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\n Emergency Response Training is conducted Annually. First Responders, are invited to attend and critique our ER Plan, PSM/RMP Plan and train with our staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
