The facility operates two shifts, 5-6 days per week, year round.  Much of the product used at the facility is produced at the Seneca Foods Corp.-Process Facility located at 1217 3rd Ave SE, Rochester, MN (approximately 8 blocks north of the Cold Storage facility).\n\nTwo ammonia refrigeration systems are used at the Cold Storage Facility ammonia is a regulated substance per 40CFR Part 68 Environmental Protection Agency (Appendix A).  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable coolant for refrigeration also make it necessary to observe certain precautions when using to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Seneca Foods policy to conform to all applicable state and federal rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which the refrigeration system is operated, safety devices engineered into the system, good maintenance procedures, as well as the training of our personnel.  The 1986 constructed system contains 9,474 lbs. of ammonia, and the 1995-constructed system contains 11,439 lbs. of ammonia-total between the two systems is 20,913 lbs.  The threshold reporting quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs., thus Seneca's Cold Storage Facility is required to comply with the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The 86 Engine Room and 95 Engine Room are separated by approximately 150 yards.  There is no mingling of ammonia between the two systems, each system supplies ammonia to specific pieces of refrigeration equipment.  The 20,913 lb. total charge of anhydrous ammonia in the two systems is used to provide refrigerant for cooling the product Storage Areas, Processing Room, and Loading Dock.

The International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (11AR) \"Guide to the Implementation of Process Safety Management (PSM) for Ammonia Refrigeration\" was used to implement the PSM program at the Cold Storage Facility.  Parts of the program include:\n\n1) Employee Participation\n2) Process Safety Information\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n4) Operating Procedures\n5) Training\n6) Contractor Requirements\n7) Pre Start-up Safety Review\n8) Mechanical Integrity Audits\n9) Hot Work Permits\n10) Management of Change\n11) Incident Investigation\n12) Emergency Planning and Response\n13) Compliance Audits\n \n\n\nJS and Associates  of Tomah, WI  was (and continues to be) used to help implement the facility's PSM program, including: system audits, PHA development, and employee training.  NewMech Companies Inc of Plymouth MN performs maintenance on the refrigeration systems.  The refrigeration systems were installed in 1986, and 1995 respectively.  All components were new when installed; no second hand equipment was used.  The systems remain in excellent condition as a result of the diligent maintenance program used by Seneca and NewMech.\n\nThe Rochester Fire Department is Seneca's Cold Storage Facility's designated outside first response team.\n\nIf an uncontrolled release develops, the following procedure will be used:\n\n1) Cold Storage Mechanic confirms leak.\n2) Cold Storage Mechanic evacuates the immediate area.\n3) Management determines the need for a plant wide evacuation\n4) An upwind location is selected and the evacuation signal is ordered by the management staff (High-Low Siren).\n5) Time cards are collected for role call.\n6) Rochester Fire Department* is notified by calling 911.\n7) Roll call is taken at the assembly area and first aid is administered.\n8) A list of employees not accounted for at roll call will be forwarded to the Rochester Fire Department.\n9) Notifi"
