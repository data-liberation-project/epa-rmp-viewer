The Kirksville facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders. This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system.  This is a system that uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Kirksville facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as with the Kirksville Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Kirksville plant is a manufacturer of meat products, specifically, ham and bacon. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is (311612).   The facility is capable of producing and packaging various ham products including bacon strips for consumer intake but the plant is not equippe"

      "SummaryText": "d to slaughter hogs.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products.  Some of these areas include: receiving, product staging, belly processing, brine mixing, curing rooms, curing over-flow and other storage areas.  The plant produces smoked bacon in smokehouses located on-site.  The back-up fuel source for the natural gas-fired boilers is propane. \n\nThe Kirksville plant has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia .  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the plant?s refrigeration process.  \nThe ammonia and propane threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia and propane stored on-site is 41,700  pounds, respectively.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to Kraft Foods in Kirksville.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public if there is a release from either system. Although the alternative release scenario is more probable, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated chemical. Described below are the associated hazards .\nAmmonia \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.    Irritation of respiratory tract,\n2.    Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\n3.    Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n"

      "SummaryText": " \n3.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Kirksville plant has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.    EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, the Kirksville facility?s ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n1.    The Utility Service Area (USA) serves as an excellent safeguard for plant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping inside the occupied rooms.  Also, since most of the pipework is out of the way of people and the machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n\n2.    The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n\n\n4.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 1999-May,24 2004. According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases, for ammonia  at this facility.\n\n5.0    Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Kirksville facility has developed an emergency response program that notifies plant employees who are divided into various response teams. There are nine in-plant contacts for an emergency.  Contact information for these individuals is located in the Emergency Response Plan.  This information can also be found in the plant?s Integrated Contingency Plan (Annex 3(b)(2)). There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency reponse training as well as a detailed description of the training content.   The plan contains specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire"

The Kirksville Fire Department will be called for fire related emergencies.  In all cases where the fire department is called, Adair County Ambulance District personnel will be called to the scene.\n\n6.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the Awhat-if= PHA completed for ammonia and the Awhat-if@ Hazard Review completed for propane, a list of action items were developed and monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished.  For example, in the ammonia system, a leak from condenser fittings, piping, valves or other instrumentation is a potential release scenario.  The following action item was recommended: implement visual inspection program on piping systems.  The recommendations were followed and the condenser inspection system was updated on 9/5/94.  There are numerous other examples of safety improvements as a result of the PHA results.  These include:\n\n1.    Need to post signs in appropriate locations that unauthorized personnel are not permitted in the engine room or the USA areas.\n\n2.    A hand truck will occasionally enter the engine room to move oil drums.  Proper awareness of hazards is required.  Only authorized personnel should be permitted to do this.\n\n3.    Production personnel currently enter the engine room to turn evaporators on and off.  These people need to be properly trained and certified in the operation of the ammonia system or this function should only be performed by the refrigeration system operators."
