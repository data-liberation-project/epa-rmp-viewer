Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Aurora Elevator, Inc. (the facility) have made it a policy to be committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  the primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one (1) - 12,000 gallon storage tank and distributed in 40 - 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The facilty includes recieving and loadout systems to enable the transfer of the anhydrous ammonia. The maximum amount stored would be about 227,500 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:  a)  The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 51,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank (12,000 gallons) at 85 % capacity as limited by design standards and administrative control. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million or ppm) is 1.7 miles.  b)  The Alternate Release Scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose, lasting 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off intervenes to stop the flow. The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles. The amount released would be subject to mitigation of excess flo"

Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6 (200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA Standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b. Compliance of these regulations is audited annually along with annual training on the handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:  The facility has:  a)   a written action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; and b)  provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know informationas required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). In the event of a release the Emergency Action plan would be put into place andresponse implemented by contacting the local fire department and LEPC through the 911 system.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve safety:  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at t"
