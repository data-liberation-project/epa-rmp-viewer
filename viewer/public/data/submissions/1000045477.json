These expectations are a key part of job performance assessments. Carus will not tolerate failure to live up to the expectations outlined in this charter; as such failure could negatively impact the health and safety of our employees, our community, and the environment.  The EHSS Charter has been reviewed and endorsed by Sierra Chemical Company, Stockton Plant personnel and plant management demonstrates EHSS leadership and commitment.\n\n\n\nIn addition to EPA's RMP rule, the Stockton plant complies with State and Federal OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's State and Federal Hazardous Waste Generator, DHS Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard and DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nThere is one Worse Case toxic release scenario and one Alternate Case toxic release scenarios assessed for the Stockton plant. Section 2 of this RMP submittal contains additional details regarding the Worse Case release scenario while Section 3 contains additional details for the Alternate Case release scenario. The six Worse Case toxic release scenarios are briefly described and include: (1) chlorine rail car releasing 202,640 pounds with a distance to end point (rural ) of 6 miles.\n\n\n\nThe one Alternate Case toxic release scenario is briefly described and includes: chlorine process pipe leak releasing 6,762 pounds with a distance to end point (rural) of 3 miles.\n\n\n\nTo ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the larges1 quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest dista"

The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\" EPA's Cameo (Aloha, marplot, cameo chemical) model used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process. Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this EPA submittal. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not taken into account. Generally, the Stockton Plant components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance  with regulatory requirements.  The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The Chlorine includes the following PSM elements process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; mechanical integrity; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; emergency planning and response. \n\nThroughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards.\n\n\n\nInfrastructure security improvements at designated areas in the plant have been implemented that provide layers of protection against deliberate man-made incidents in accordance with applicable elements of U.S. Department of Homeland Security's CFATS Risk Based Performance Standards."

The operators responded quickly and were able to close the liquid chlorine angle valve on the rail car.  And employees evacuated quickly as required by the Emergency Action plan.
