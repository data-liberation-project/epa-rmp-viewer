      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) for LTV Steel's Hennepin, Illinois Works was prepared in response to section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The plan addresses the requirements outlined in 40 CFR 68.155 thru 68.185 and appendix A\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response:\n\nThe Hennepin Works uses approximately 24 tons of liquefied chlorine annually for water treatment purposes.  The chlorine is contained in one ton cylinders which are stored at three locations.  Chlorine gas can be hazardous under various conditions and must be handled safely to reduce the threat of unnecessary exposure to LTV personnel  and to members of the nearby community.  It is the policy of LTV Steel to comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations.\n\nLTV Steel  helps to ensure the safety of the community and its workforce by properly operating and maintaining its facilities, use of safety devices inherent in the design of the processes ( including alarms ), and through proper training of personnel.\n\nThe facility emergency response program is written and includes an emergency action plan for chlorine releases.  This plan is a part of the off-site response plan on file with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Hennepin Fire Department in accordance with the provisions of the \"Superfund Ammendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986\" (SARA Title III).  These plans include procedures for notifying local emergency response agencies.\n\n2. The stationary sources and regulated substance:\n\nThe Hennepin Works processes hot rolled steel coils thru several operations including a temper mill, tandem mill, pickle line, batch annealing, and a galvanize line.  Some of the auxillary services which support the main operations are the roll shop, garage, and utility departments.\n\nIllinois river water is used at the plant for both contact and non-contact applications.  Chlorine is used  to treat water at three different locations within the Henn"

Each of the three processes is checked at least once on daily basis and each system has an alarm system which activates when chlorine levels exceed five parts per million near the process area.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternate release scenarios:\n\nWorst case scenario -  Failure of a full one-ton cylinder of chlorine which would result in a release of \n2000 pounds of chlorine over a ten minute time period.\n\nThe distance to the toxic end-point 0.0087 mg/L for this scenario is 3.0 miles.\n\nAlternative scenario -  Rupture of  the 3/8\" tubing leading from the chlorine cylinder to the manifold which     would result in a release rate of eightteen and one-half pounds per minute over fifteen minutes.\n\nThe distance to the toxic end-point of 0.0087 mg/L for this scenario is 0.2 miles.\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility has developed a Process Safety Management Plan for its chlorine processes as required by 29 CFR 1910.119 of the OSHA standards.  Facility personnel are trained to respond in accordance with the provisions of the plan.\n\n5. Five year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no releases from any of the chlorine processes within the last five years.\n\n6. The emergency response program:\n\nLTV's Hennepin Works has established and implemented an emergency action plan for the entire facility.  This plan is the Hennepin Plant Emergency Response Plan and is on file with the Hennepin Fire Department  and the Putnam County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7. Planned changes to impr"
