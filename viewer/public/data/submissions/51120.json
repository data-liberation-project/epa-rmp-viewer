      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nThe Poet Biorefining-Big Stone facility is located approximately 2\n miles west of Big Stone City, South Dakota.  Poet Biorefining-Big Stone?s\n main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.\n Production at the facility was initiated in January 2002.  Poet\n Biorefining-Big Stone produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is\n mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is cooked\n and liquefied.  The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is\n added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars.  Yeast is\n added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 10% alcohol and is distilled,\n then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous\n ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two\n 2,000,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas\n condensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per\n federal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is stored in Tank No.\n 805, which has a capacity of 60,000 gallons (approximately 378,000\n pounds).  NGC is blended with the ethanol to a maximum concentration of 5%\n NGC.  The denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank\n trucks and rail cars.\n\nChemicals Regulated Under EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Program\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which\nexceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.\nThe CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage\n tank, the dentatured ethanol storage tanks, and the associated\n blending/transfer equipment and piping.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to\n a concentration of 2% to 5%.  The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of\n denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping system is the quantity in the\n denaturant storage tank, located in the center containment area of the\n tank farm.  \n\nEmergency Response Policy and P"

      "SummaryText": "rogram\nPoet Biorefining-Big Stone is committed to the protection of it\n employees, the surrounding community and the environment from hazardous\n substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.  In the event of an\n emergency, Poet Biorefining-Big Stone?s Emergency Coordinator will\n direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the\n qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable\n precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling\n of materials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees\n within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if\n such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety.  In the\n event of a larger release, it is the policy of Poet Biorefining-Big\n Stone to notify the Big Stone City Fire Department and evacuate all\n employees at the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program, and Chemical-Specific Prevention\n Steps\nPoet Biorefining-Big Stone is committed to protection of the\n environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee\n training and response preparation.  Public access to the facility from the\n highway is restricted by a gate.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting\n vehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically\n on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a multi-camera video\n surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer\n based alarm system.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage\n tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill\n monitors).  The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal\n conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible\n alarms.  All of the facility storage tanks have secondary storage\n containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and\n Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe facility has an excellent record w"
