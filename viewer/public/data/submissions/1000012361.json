      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\n    AREVA NP,Inc. owns and operates a nuclear fuel fabrication facility located at 2101 Horn Rapids Road, just inside the northern boundary of the City of Richland. The plant produces nuclear fuel bundle assemblies for reactors. The plant has one regulated chemical, Ammonium Hydroxide. Ammonium hydroxide >20% (at Areva not exceeding 23%)  is used to precipitate ammonium diuranate (ADU) from UO2F2 in Areva's \"wet uranium conversion process\".\n\nEMERGENCY RESPOSE POLICIES\n\n     Corporate Policy 0208 \"Environmental, Health and Safety Programs\" states; \"Areva NP highly values the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities\". This policy outlines \"Our Principles\" for accountability, stewardship, standards, performance, and communication. Under accountability it is stated that \"Leadership is accountable for systematically managing environmental, health & safety risks, opportunities and impacts as an integral part of our business\".\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n    The plant is licensed as a major materials licensee by the U.S.Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under their regulations in 10 CFR Part 70. Wastes are regulated by the NRC and/or the Washington Department of Ecology(WDOE). In addition, the City of Richland  regulates liquid effluents under the terms of a industrial waste discharge permit. The possession/utilization of radionuclides other than enriched uranium is regulated by the Washington Department of Health. Industrial Health and Safety is regulated by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries which also regulates the OSHA PSM rule. On a local government level, the plant is regulated by the Benton County Clean Air Authority and the City of Richland. Accident prevention and environmental protection programs stem from a top-level policy of comliance with all applicable health,safety, and enviromental regulations and a clear assignment of line management responsibilities to assure compliance is achieved. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT "

      "SummaryText": "HISTORY\n\n    The company has not had an accident in the last five years that involved the release of a RMP-regulated chemical that would require reporting per the regulation in this summary.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n    The emergency response organization consists of the Plant Emergency Response Management Team (PERMT) and the Plant Emergency Response Team (PERT) assisted by the Joint Information Center (JIC). PERMT is controlled by the Plant Emergency Response Director and is responsile for classifying all declared emergency incidents and notifying applicable local,county,state, and federal agencies. PERT is controlled by the Incident Commander in concert with the local fire department to mitigate all emergency incidents. The JIC jointly provides information and updates along with local,state, and federal agencies to the media and public about all emergency incidents. Several training drills are conducted yearly (some including outside agencies) and the PERT is given 24hours of training a year. \n\nPLANED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n    The company has extensively evaluated the safety of its regulated chemicals during the PSM hazards analyses program. The regulated chemicals have also been extensively evaluated as part of AREVA's NRC license requirement to have a \"Integrated Safety Analysis\" program. This program combines chemical,fire, radiological, criticality, and natural hazards into one integrated analysis. The ISA is maintained current in accordance with the plant's change control process."
