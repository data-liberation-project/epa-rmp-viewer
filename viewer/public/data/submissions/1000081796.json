Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at United Farmers Co-op in Hamburg are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Hamburg Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  Our facility maintains sixteen 1,450 gallon nurse tanks and four double 1,000 gallon or eight 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and one 30,000 gallon fixed tank.  Anhydrous ammonia stored in the nurse tanks is 136472 pounds and the fixed tank has 131,223 pounds at 85% maximum fill level. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in all tanks at the facility is 267,695 pounds. The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.\n\n\n\n3.    Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.   \n\n\n\n4.
