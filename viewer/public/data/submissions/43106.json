      "SummaryText": "The Berwick/Bayou Vista Water Plant stores chlorine, which is regulated and considered hazardous by the EPA under the Chemical Accident Prevention Program.  The same properties that make this chemical so valuable in water treatment also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling it.  Safe handling procedures prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to our own personal health and co-workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle chlorine, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe Berwick/Bayou Vista Water Plant is a small facility, which provides potable water for the Berwick/Bayou Vista area.  It is located at 400 Pattie Drive in Berwick.  The primary purpose of this facility is to produce potable water for the surrounding communities.  The raw water is pumped into the facility from the nearby Bayou Teche.  The water then goes through several processes to remove the particles and contaminants that are in the water.  Chlorine is added to the water in the final step of the process.  Chlorine is used to kill pathogens that may remain after the process is complete.  The water is then pumped into distribution system to the residents of Berwick and Bayou Vista.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable stae codes and regulatioins.  All employees undergo training in the emergency procedures associated with chlorine.  This facility had no reportable release of chlorine in the past five years.  This facility's emergency response plan is coordinated with the St. Mary Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  In the case of an emergency the facility's employees are trained to contact the local fire department that"
