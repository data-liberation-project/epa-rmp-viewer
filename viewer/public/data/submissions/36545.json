There is one isopentane tank with the maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons located on site.  Isopentane is a listed flammable substance under the Risk Management Plan regulations found at 40 CFR 68, and is subject to those regulations since it is stored in a quantity in excess of 10,000 pounds.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling isopentane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of Genpak's employees as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Genpak's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which Genpak handles isopentane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of personnel.\n\nGenpak developed the emergency response program at this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors."
