Shell Chemical Company originally built the plant in 1968.  DuPont acquired the plant in October 1986 as part of its Agricultural Products business and we have continued to add to our facilities.  We currently have 204 employees and there are approximately 100 contractors working with us every day.  Our employees are active in churches, youth sports, schools, and other activities around our plant, in Mobile, Baldwin, and Washington counties.  \n\nDuPont is committed to improving the quality of life and enhancing the vitality of communities in which the company has a major business presence.  The DuPont Mobile Manufacturing Center primarily produces crop protection chemicals for use in agricultural applications.  Some of our products include insecticides such as STEWARD and specialty chemicals used in the manufacture of fibers and detergents.  Our products contribute to an abundant and safe supply of food for the world's people.  We adhere to the highest standards for safe operations and for the protection of the environment, our people, customers, and the citizens of the communities in which we do business. \n\nEvery person on site has the right and responsibility to stop ANY work he or she sees as unsafe.  This includes shutting a process unit down.  We will not make a product if we can not make it safely.  We have worked over 15 years without an injury causing any employee to miss work.  \n\nAt the DuPont Mobile Manufacturing Center, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.

Our plant uses four listed chemicals that meet the minimum storage quantities for reporting.  We have analyzed the effects to our workers and the community if something should happen that caused these chemicals to be released into the air using EPA?s guidance for Worst Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios.  This information, along with a well-developed risk management system, our Process Safety Management program, our emergency response programs coordinated with local response agencies, and a 5-year accident history make up our Risk Management Plan.\n\nWorst Case Scenarios?\n\nThe EPA established the assumptions for these unlikely scenarios.  The worst case toxic release scenario for our site results from the failure of cylinders of chlorine connected together inside a scrubbed enclosure.   We had to assume that all cylinders broke open catastrophically, spilling their entire contents in 10 minutes, and the vapors, which escape outside of the building, are carried"

Although this building has a scrubber to reduce the amount of vapors potentially released to the atmosphere, we cannot take credit for it or any of our other active safety systems in this case. We can however take credit for the passive system of having the chlorine being released inside of a building.  EPA provided a standard procedure to calculate the distance where the amount of the chemical in the air would be sufficient to make most people sick if they breathed it for one hour.  Under these highly improbable conditions, the vapors would extend offsite and would impact public receptors.  \n\nThe worst case flammable scenario for our site results from the catastrophic failure of a propane storage vessel.  Using the assumptions established by EPA, the entire contents of this vessel would instantaneously vaporize with no active mitigation and form a cloud that explodes.  This explosion may be heard off-site but would not have any other off-site impact. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios...\n\nWhile the worst case scenario focuses on catastrophic potential, the EPA also established assumptions for an alternative release scenario, which looked at a more realistic situation that could potentially impact our neighbors.  For these scenarios, we can take credit for all of the things we do to make our plant a safer place through design and operation of our processes.  None of our alternative releases would impact residential or environmental receptors.  A small pipe leak in the chlorine feed line is the site's alternate release scenario.   Chlorine detectors are installed inside and outside the cylinder building as well as around the perimeter of the process area.  These detectors initiate alarms and interlocks to shutdown the flow of chlorine in the event of a release.\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nAs an indication of how realistic these Alternative Release Scenario"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
