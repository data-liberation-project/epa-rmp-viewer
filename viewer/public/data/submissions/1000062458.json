This document provides a brief overview of the comprehenisve risk mangement activities that we have desgined and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history from accidental releases of chemical regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nOur facility produces bleached market pulp, and fine papers using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The bleached pulp portion uses a kraft pulping process and supplies fiber to the fine paper manufacturing facility as well as manufacturing baled market pulp.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accident release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nA 1% solution of chlorine dioxide is stored in 140,000 gallon tanks and is used to bleach hardwood kraft pulp.\n\n\n\nFlammables \n\n\n\nNo RMP list flammables are on site. Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nThis scenario assumes the rupture of a full, 140,000 gallon tank containing a 1% chlorine dioxide solution and the vaporization of the released solution.  The tank has dikes present to mitigate the extent of the release.  The model suggests the off site consequences would be in the area defined by a circle with the radius of 4.78 miles from the source (mill).\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe scenario assumes a 1% chlorine dioxide solution process pipe leak.  This leak results in the release of the contents of an eight (8) inch pipe, 250 feet in length.  The scenario assumes no mitigation, and a release of 55 pounds of chlorine dioxide that is vapoized from the liquid release.  The models suggests the area impacted by the off site consequences would be defined by a circle with the diameter of 1.3 miles from the release site (mill).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n* Process safety information\n\n* Process hazard analysis\n\n* Operating procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical integrity\n\n* Management of change\n\n* Pre-startup review\n\n* Compliance audits\n\n* Incident investigation\n\n* Employee participation\n\n* Hot work permit\n\n* Contractors\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.
