The amount of ammonia estimated to be in the system is 42,000 pounds.   \nBased on the size and characteristics of our ammonia system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nNecessary processes to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 have been implemented and are ongoing.  The facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) - \n\nThe newly developed Process Safety Information Guideline contains an inventory list of necessary documents that are in place as of March 2008.  This information will be revised as the newly installed ammonia refrigeration system is put into operation.  This data contains detailed safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis -\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis PSM Guideline and full PHA study for the refrigeration system was completed in March 2008.

Safe Operating Procedures are in place that address necessary modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, and pump out.\n\nTraining -\n\nNew Training PSM Guideline was adopted March 2008, defining training programs for employees working with the ammonia refrigeration systems to increase competence in all relevant operating procedures.  Refresher training is specified to take place at a minimum every three (3) years, and more frequently, as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity -\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity PSM Guideline was adopted March 2008.  Maintenance operations are being carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in ammonia refrigeration system maintenance practices.  \n\nAny equipment deficiencies identified by ongoing maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change -\n\nThe Management of Change PSM Guideline was adopted March 2008. The guideline defines procedures that are in place to manage changes in the ammonia system's technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia system modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews -\n\nThe Pre-Startup Review PSM Guideline was adopted March 2008.
