The plant provides electricity, steam and chilled water to meet current and future campus demand. The CUP contains two gas turbine generators rated at 4.75 megawatts (MW) each, one heat recovery steam generators (HRSG's) and associated duct burners, two steam turbine generator (rated at 3.75 MW), two auxiliary boilers (each rated at 90,000 lb/hr of steam), and three diesel generators (each rated at 2 MW) for emergency electric power.\r\nIn order to meet the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions limit required by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District's (BAAQMD) Regulation 9, Rule 7, the two HRSG's and two gas turbines are equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system.  The SCR system uses ammonia, in the presence of a catalyst, to convert NOx contained in the gas turbine exhaust into nitrogen gas and water vapor.  The ammonia gas is obtained from a 29.5% solution of aqueous ammonia (aqua ammonia) which is stored in an 8,000-gallon steel underground storage tank located on UCSF property at the corner of Parnassus Avenue and Medical Center Way.  Aqua ammonia was chosen over anhydrous ammonia because it is significantly less hazardous.  The aqua ammonia system consists of unloading, storage, transfer, vaporization and injection systems. \r\nThe aqua ammonia unloading system will receive and transfer the contents of the delivery tanker truck from the unloading station to the underground double wall steel storage tank in the containment structure.  This tank is anchored to a concrete slab in a pit filled with pea gravel and covered by the containment building floor slab. All lighting and equipment in the building are designed as explosion proof.  Smoking and other ignition sources in the vicinity of the containment structure w"

The safe handling of ammonia is enhanced by designing the facilities to include multiple safety devices and engineering controls, by implementing effective training programs for personnel, and by following standard operating procedures.  Both passive and active mitigation measures have been incorporated into the facility design.  \r\n  These measures are complemented by the presence of a robust emergency response program.  In particular, UCSF maintains an Emergency Response Team (ERT) that is knowledgeable and trained to handle hazardous material spills such as aqua ammonia.  The ERT can resolve accidental releases of a hazardous material by controlling and mitigating the release to allow a safe return to normal operations. This RMP identifies the system/process controls to further clarify the extent to which UCSF has identified and implemented the necessary measures to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the facility. The UCSF accidental release prevention program has been established to provide to the maximum extent possible a risk free environment for employees, patients, visitors and neighbors.\r\n\r\n(b)   The stationary source consists of an aqua ammonia unloading facility and underground storage tank located on the corner of Parnassus Avenue and Medical Center Way on the Parnassus Heights campus.  A transfer pump and piping delivers the aqua ammonia to the selective catalytic reduction unit located on the first floor of the Central Utilities Plant. The regulated substance is 29.5% aqua ammonia, an ammonia solution consisting of just over 70% water.  The regulated substance has a maximum inventory of 8,000 gallons at any given time.  The maximum delivery quantity is approximately 3,500 gallons.  \r\n\r\n(c)   The general accidental release prevention and chemical-specific prevention steps are based on passive and active mitigation systems.

No backing maneuvers are required by the driver nor is the delivery truck required to drive on Medical Center Way.  The drive-through procedure minimizes impact on both vehicle and pedestrian traffic.\r\nThe aqua ammonia transfer system will convey aqua ammonia as needed from the storage tank to the CUP facility via a 700 foot, 3/4 inch, double-walled underground pipe.  The aqua ammonia transfer system consists of two pumps and associated piping.  The pumps are self contained and located inside the containment structure.\r\nThe injection system is located at the CUP is computer controlled to minimize NOx emissions.  The system receives, vaporizes, and regulates the rate of ammonia fed into the SCR catalyst bed.  Ammonia emissions from the plant are limited by BAAQMD permit to less than 20ppm.  \r\n\r\n  \tThe administering agency, SFDPH/HMUPA, has required UCSF to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the federal, state and local laws.  The federal law is provided under the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r); state law is specified in the California Health and Safety Code (Article 2,  Chapter 6.95, Division 20) and in the California Code of Regulations (19CCR2735-2785.1); and the local law is found in the San Francisco Municipal Health Code (Article 21, Chapter 5). \r\n\r\n  \tThe RMP has been reviewed and evaluated by design, construction, operations, and health and safety personnel.

In addition, the interior air is exhausted to the outside atmosphere through a gaseous ammonia scrubber (impregnated activated charcoal) system.\r\n\r\n  An ammonia leak detection system is provided to monitor the ambient air concentrations near the aqua ammonia storage tank.  In particular, ammonia detectors are located inside the containment structure, inside the catch basin, outside the structure at the vent exhausts and other selected ambient air locations, and in the interstitial annular space of the double walled storage tank and piping.
