Accidental Release prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at Del Real Foods, LLC are committed to protecting people and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are available to control and mitigate the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Moore Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThis facility was completely evacuated and renovated and is not the same process as previously was located within the facility.  We have one chemical at our facility that is subject to the Process Safety and Risk Management regulations.  That substance is Anhydrous Ammonia.  The maximum inventory of Ammonia that is expected to be present at this facility, based upon process and operational requirements, is 15,250 pounds.  The ammonia system is to be started up in phases with the NW Engine Room System starting on 10/30/2018 and consisting of 8,100# of ammonia.  The NE Engine Room System will be started on 12/1/2018 and consist of 7,150# of ammonia.  The South Engine Room was evacuated and is not planned to be in use at this time.  All three systems are separate closed loop systems within the same building.  \n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nDel Real Foods, LLC. has taken the following steps, as required by 40 CFR Part 68 (EPA's Risk Management Planning regulations).

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to conduct these analyses is the What-If-Checklist.  These analyses were completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a frequency of at least every 5 years.  Any recommendations resulting from these analyses are scheduled and completed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nDel Real Foods, LLC. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to personnel who operate and/or maintain the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nDel Real Foods, LLC. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that personnel who operate and/or maintain the ammonia refrigeration system are trained and certified.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are evaluated and determined to be competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least triennially and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nDel Real Foods, LLC. conducts documented maintenance inspections and tests on process equipment to ensure proper operation.

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other persons whose job tasks are affected by a modification of process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given, training regarding the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to established processes are conducted when they are required at Del Real Foods, LLC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe start-up prior to placing any equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\n\n\nDel Real Foods, LLC. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions of the Process Safety and Risk Management regulations are being implemented.  These audits are completed at least every three years and any noted corrective actions are assigned and scheduled in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\n\n\nDel Real Foods, LLC. promptly investigates any accident or incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of Ammonia (anhydrous).
