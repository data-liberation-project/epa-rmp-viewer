We have one chemical at our facility that is subject to the Process Safety and Risk Management regulations.  That substance is Anhydrous Ammonia.  The maximum inventory of Ammonia that is expected to be present at this facility, based upon process and operational requirements, is 15,250 pounds.  The ammonia system is to be started up in phases with the NW Engine Room System starting on 10/30/2018 and consisting of 8,100# of ammonia.  The NE Engine Room System will be started on 12/1/2018 and consist of 7,150# of ammonia.  The South Engine Room was evacuated and is not planned to be in use at this time.
