Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThe City of Fort Bragg Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), located  within the City of Fort Bragg, in the vicinity of Soldier Point (AP 008-020-07-00), handles chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are considered hazardous materials.  Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are regulated substances and both are considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  \nThe properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  \nSafety depends upon using safe procedures when handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide; upon using the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and upon the training of pertinent personnel.\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\nPlant description:\nThe City of Fort Bragg's Wastewater Treatment Plant is designed to treat 2.2 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater from the residences and businesses of the City.  The treatment process consists of bar screens, one primary clarifier, an activated sludge aeration basin, two secondary clarifiers, a chlorine contact chamber, a dechlorination and pH adjustment system, and discharge pumps to send treated wastewater to the Pacific Ocean.  There is also a sludge dewatering belt press.\nThe wastewater treatment facility operates automatically twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  Personnel are present for about nine hours per day on weekdays (8:00 AM to 5:00 PM) and for about four hours to five per day on the weekends.  Personnel may not be present for continuous periods of time on the weekends.  WWTP staff on weekend duty are also responsible for keeping Fort Bragg?s water treatment plant in operation.\nChlorine use:\nChlorine i"

Because chlorine is toxic to aquatic life, sulfur dioxide is used to neutralize the chlorine before it is discharged into the Pacific Ocean.  Chlorine is delivered by a commercial chlorine supplier in one-ton containers for use at the WWTP.  An electric hoist is used to off-load the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle.  All the one-ton containers are placed in the toxic gas storage building.  At any given time, a single chlorine container is on-line.  Three other chlorine containers are in the toxic gas storage building.  These containers are either full and waiting to be used or they are empty and awaiting replacement.  The physical size and configuration of the toxic gas storage building at the WWTP limits the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than 4 one-ton chlorine containers for a total of 8,000 pounds.\nSulfur dioxide use:\nSulfur dioxide is delivered by a commercial supplier in one-ton containers for use at the WWTP.  The same electric hoist used to handle one-ton chlorine containers is used to off-load the one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide.  At any given time, a single sulfur dioxide container is on-line.  The second sulfur dioxide container is either full and waiting to be used or it is empty.  The physical size and configuration of the toxic gas storage building at the WWTP limits the number of one-ton gas cylinders inside the structure.  Only five cylinders fit inside the building.  Staff policy is to store all four full containers of chlorine inside the structure and to limit the amount of sulfur dioxide stored inside the building to no more than a single one-ton container.  But two one-ton containers (for a total of 4,000 pounds) are normally kept on hand.  The extra container is stored outside the toxic gas storage building.  The extra tank is unchocked and simply rests on the tarmac surface.  When the first tank (either chlorine "

The paved approach to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage area provides only marginally adequate room for the delivery and parking of the delivery vehicles during the off-loading of the full one-ton containers and loading of the empty one-ton containers.  Two WWTP operators must be inside the toxic gas storage building when the delivery truck moves into the loading position.  One operator operates the hoist used to move the one-ton containers.  The second operator attaches the lifting bar to the container to be moved and controls the swinging of the suspended container.\nClearances are such that the WWTP operators are trapped in the toxic gas storage building when the delivery truck is in place.  In the event of a gas release, escape is not possible.\nThe toxic gas storage building is not in an area subject to ordinary vehicular traffic.  Normally, only maintenance vehicles, the WWTP tractor and gas delivery vehicles operate near the toxic gas storage building.  No unauthorized personnel are allowed entry into the building.  Storage and handling of both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is conducted pursuant to standards deemed adequate by the design engineer at the time of the wastewater treatment plant design (circa 1970).  \nChlorine gas is stored in pressurized one-ton containers.  Chlorine gas leaves the ?in-service? one-ton container, passes through a manifold under pressure.  From the manifold, the chlorine gas moves under pressure to a regulator.  The regulator controls the rate at which chlorine gas enters the chlorinator.  The chlorinator mixes the gas with process water and injects chlorinated water into the wastewater stream.\nSulfur dioxide gas is withdrawn from the one-ton ?in-service"

      "SummaryText": "? container by vacuum.  This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragms and withdraws the gas from the one-ton container in service at controlled feed rates.  The feed rates are controlled by individual metering devices.  Flow rate settings are controlled by the operators.  The sulfur dioxide feed unit operates in similar fashion to the chlorine feed unit.  The sulfur dioxide is fed into the wastewater stream after the treated wastewater leaves the chlorine contact chamber.  The sulfur dioxide is used to de-chlorinate the wastewater effluent before it is discharged in to the Pacific Ocean.\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide are considered as parts of a single process. \n3.    Release Scenarios:\nFor 2005, all scenarios were re-examined using the U.S. EPA / NOAA ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) computer model Version 5.3.1.  This model makes predictions for only a few select geographic locations.  The predictions are made for Eureka, California and are assumed to be applicable to Fort Bragg.  The release scenarios developed in 2000 used ALOHA version 5.2.3 and did not take local weather data into consideration.  ALOHA version 5.3.1 yields different (more conservative) results from the earlier versions of the model.  ALOHA version 5.3.1 is also less sensitive than the version used for the 2000 release scenarios.  The Alternative Release scenario developed for 2000 could not be reproduced using ALOHA version 5.3.1.  Instead, one Alternative Release scenario and a second Minimum Release scenario were developed.\n3a.    Meteorological conditions:\nThe Fort Bragg WWTP is located on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  Winds from the ocean dominate the site.  There is no available record of wind conditions on or near the site, but National Data Buoy Center Station 46014 is located off Point Arena at latitude 39.22 N and longitude 123.97 W, 17.35 miles southwest of the site.

Worst Case Release Scenarios:\nThe assumptions for Worst Case Release scenarios are specified in 40 CFR 68.  Requirements define a Worst Case Release as the venting of the contents of one of the largest containers within a ten-minute period.  Requirements specify that the potential impacted area be identified using Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2) or 3 ppm.\nChlorine:\nThe one-ton (2,000 pounds) chlorine container is the largest vessel size (and only chlorine vessel size) in the chlorine system located at the WWTP.   The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one-ton chlorine container assumes that the full 2,000 pounds of chlorine is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  \nThe distance to the 3 ppm endpoint for the Worst Case scenario is 2.0 miles.  This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source (i.e., the wastewater treatment facility).\nSulfur dioxide:\nThe one-ton (2,000 pounds) sulfur dioxide container is the largest vessel size (and only sulfur dioxide vessel size) in the sulfur dioxide system located at WWTP.  The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one-ton chlorine sulfur dioxide assumes that the full 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the 3 ppm endpoint for the Worst Case scenario is 2.1 miles.  This sulfur dioxide release will extend beyond the boundaries of the WWTP\n \n3c.  Alternative Release Scenarios:\nThe Alternative Release scenario for chlorine for the one-ton container located at the WWTP assumes a release from a sheared valve, resulting in an estimated average release rate of  22.9 pounds per minute.  The period of release is estimated by ALOHA to be 1 hour in duration, resultin"

This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the WWTP.\nThe Alternative Release scenario for sulfur dioxide for the one-ton container located at the WWTP also assumes a release from a sheared valve, resulting in an estimated average release of 13.4 pounds per minute.  The period of release is predicted by ALOHA to be 1 hour in duration, resulting in a total release quantity of 670 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  The distance to the 3 ppm endpoint for the Alternative Release scenario is 0.53 miles.  This sulfur dioxide release will extend beyond the boundaries of the WWTP.\nALOHA Version 5.3.1 was tested assuming a 1 mm hole in a single tank.  This is the smallest leak the model will accommodate.  The Minimum Alternative Release scenario for chlorine predicts a 141 pound release over a period of one hour, with an average release rate of 2.35 pounds per minute.  The distance to the 3 ppm endpoint is 352 yards or 0.20 miles.  \nThe Minimum Alternative Release scenario for sulfur dioxide predicts an 80 pound release over a period of one hour, with a sustained release rate of 1.34 pounds per minute.  The distance to the 3 ppm endpoint is 274 yards or 0.16 miles.  These Minimum Alternative Releases extend beyond the boundaries of the WWTP.\n3d.    Mitigation Measures:\nAs this Risk Management Plan is prepared, WWTP staff are planning for the installation of new chlorine gas regulators and a new manifold and piping system.  When the installation is complete, the gas feed system for chlorine will be converted from a pressurized system to a vacuum operated system.  The conversion of the chlorine system from a pressure system to a vacuum system will be a major step forward in toxic gas handling techniques, in improving worker safety, and in mitigating the amount of gas that might be released during a spill.\nThe sulfur dioxide syste"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nThe facility does not comply with accepted industrial standards.\n?    There is no way to escape from the toxic gas storage building in the event of a release while the 1-ton tanks are being loaded onto or unloaded from the delivery truck.\n?    There are no chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak detectors in the feed rate control room.\n?    There are no chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak detectors in the toxic gas storage building, although the wind passing through this building minimizes the utility of such detectors.\n?    There are no functional safety devices to stop a leak should one occur.  The nearest such devices are stored at the Fort Bragg Fire Department.\n?    There is only a minimal amount of safety apparatus on hand.  WWTP personnel each received one individually-fitted respirator in June 2005.  The respirators only allow personnel to escape in the event of a spill.  There is no equipment that would enable WWTP personnel to stop a leak.\nWWTP staff members are proactive in improving safety in the workplace.  There are scheduled safety meetings.  There are specific safety training programs.  \n5. Five Year Accident History:\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the past five years at the WWTP facility.  There has been one nearby incident involving a delivery truck loaded with one-ton and 150-lb tanks of chlorine, with one-ton tanks of sulfur dioxide and with sodium hypochlorite.  The truck left State Highway 1 under unexplained circumstances.  The wreck resulted in the release of sodium hypochlorite and the death of the driver.  The driver made a delivery to this facility just before the fatal incident.\n6. Emergency Response Program:\nNo WWTP operators are trained in controlling sustained releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  There are no Emergency Kits designed to enable qualified staff to c"

Therefore, all sustained releases, no matter if they are from fusible plugs or from leaks in container sidewalls or from valves, require evacuation of the WWTP by all people on the premises.  All sustained leaks will trigger an Emergency Response Program.\nThe Emergency Response Program has 4 parts:\nFirst, when a leak is discovered, the person discovering the leak must notify all the people on the WWTP premises that a leak has occurred and that an evacuation is necessary.\nSecond, everyone on the WWTP premises must gather at a designated assembly point.\nThird, a WWTP staff person must notify the emergency responders of the leak and of the need for an emergency response.  This can be done by calling 911.\nFourth, first responders must contact WWTP staff at the assembly point to learn the details of the leak.  First responders are the staff of the Fort Bragg Fire department. \nThe Mendocino County Division of Environmental Health Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThe 2005 Process Hazard Analysis (see Appendix 3) identified six structural improvements necessary to meet basic safety requirements.  One of those improvements, the conversion of the chlorination system from a pressure system to a vacuum system, has been authorized.\nThe 2005 Process Hazard Analysis identified two engineering studies necessary to the continued safe operation of the Chlorination / Dechlorination system at the WWTP.\nThe 2005 Process Hazard Analysis identified four areas in which significant administrative effort is needed for the continued safe operation of the Chlorination / Dechlorination system at the WWTP.\nCCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 requires a Compliance Audit at least every three years."
