      "SummaryText": "American Industrial Chemical Corporation is a chemical distribution company. This facility receives bulk shipments, stores, repackages and transports various chemicals. Ammonium Hydroxide and Hydrofluoric Acid are the only materials regulated by the Risk Management Plan at this site. The accidental release prevention program utilized at American Industrial Chemical Corporation consists of elements required by the EPA Risk Management Program. American Industrial Chemical Corporation also has an emergency response program that meets the requirements of the standard. The worst case senario involves the loss of the maximum amount of 29.4% Ammonium Hydroxide solution and 70% Hydrofluoric Acid solution. Details regarding the hazard assessment of this scenario are included in this plan. In addition, alternative releases involving the loss of 1000 pounds of 29.4% Ammonium Hydroxide during a hose rupture and a 500 pound release of 70% Hydrofluoric Acid due to a container puncture are evaluated. These release weights were determined based upon emergency shutdown and containment procedures used at the facility. In the last five years there have been no accidental releases of these chemicals at this facility. American Industrial Chemical Corporation takes great pride in its quality, safety, environmental and risk management systems. These systems are proven effective and are in a constant state of continuous improvement."
