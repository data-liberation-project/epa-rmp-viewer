We use a system of safety devices, rigorous training, strict procedures, and integrated emergency response to prevent releases and reduce the impact of releases that might occur.                Safety controls include leak detectors, spill containment, alarms which automatically stop the process, and redundant safties on critical functions.   The following safety measures are in place: regular equipment inspection and preventative maintenance to ensure proper operation; implementation of PSM; E.A.T. training of all employees in job functions, safe operation, process controls, and emergency actions; written operating procedures and standards based on hazard risk assessment; a trained emergency response team to take control during an emergency situation; root cause investigationof all incidents to identify cause and appropriate corrective action; and regular audits of procedures, equipment, and systems by both Sealed Air and outside agencies.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nThe Cryovac Food Packaging Plant at Indianapolis has implemented an accidental release prevention policy, which integrates containment technologies, redundant safety systems, operational procedures, and management practices.  All Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to.  The Cryovac Emergency Response Policy involves site specific plans, which are detailed in the Emergency Operations Manual (EOM).  This includes a trained on site, around the clock Emergency Response Team, and procedures to notify the local fire authority.\n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\n\n\n\nCryovac Food Packaging manufactures plastic foam packaging used in the food industry.  The plant uses pentane and isobutane as blowing agents to make plastic foam.  These are the only regulated substance in threshold quantities at this location.  Pentane (CAS 109-66-0) is a flammable aliphatic hydrocarbon similar to gasoline and isobutane (CAS 75-28-5) is a colorless, odorless flammable gas.  Pentane is used and stored as a liquid in a un-pressurized UST. Isobutane is used and stored in pressurized AST. The blowing agents are released (slowly out gassed) from the product during the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n3.  THE WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\n    \n\nThe \"worst-case release\" scenario as defined by EPA assumes a rail car delivery    container completely fails, all safety systems fail, worst-case weather conditions exist, the vapors find an ignition source and 10% of release explodes.  The endpoint is at 1 psi overpressure is .37 miles.  The \"alternative release\" scenario or more credible scenario is based on an analysis of potential hazards at our facility.  Maximum release is 2000 gallons form a breach of a railcar or catastrophic failure of the delivery piping.  The impact distance is based on maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects"

      "SummaryText": " of a vapor cloud fire might have serious consequences, .06 miles or in most cases, within our property lines.  The impact distance in both cases has been derived using the EPA \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" document. The above analysis is based on a pentane release, and would constitute a larger incident than the isobutane because of the smaller storage vessels, smaller tank filling volumes, and smaller usage in the manufacturing process. Both chemicals involve flammability risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  THE GENERAL CRYOVAC ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC     PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\n* E.A.T.  Training of operators\n\n* PSM process- completed HAZOP review of all stages of process\n\n* Spill containment and 30,000 gallons capture vault for unloading areas\n\n* Monitored double wall tanks and piping for pentane\n\n* Hydrocarbon sensor safety interlock system\n\n* Highly detailed check off sheets for any tank filling with radio monitoring\n\n* Redundant alarms for potential upset conditions\n\n* Preventative maintenance program\n\n* Check-off sheet procedures for non-routine activities such as linf breaking or draining of Tanks or piping.\n\n* Use NFPA guidelines as a minimum standard for all fire protection systems.\n\n\n\nChemical - specific prevention steps include having detection meter calibrated to pentane (lowest LEL) and plant wide training on the properties, risks, and safe use of pentane and butane which have similar flammability risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. FIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORIES:\n\n \n\nThere has been three accidental releases over the past five years, all of which involved releases of less than one gallon.  There were no injuries, property damage or offsite consequences as a result of these incidents.  In place systems resulted in early detection and mitigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response program incorporates an on-site Emergency Response Team fully trained and equipped for incipient fire fighting, awareness level hazmat response, c"
