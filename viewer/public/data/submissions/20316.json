The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a (2) 18,000 gallon aboveground containers and (50) 1,000 gallon nurse trailers, with the capacity to contain 383,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario.  The worst case toxic release scenario was evaluated using EPA's RMP COMP software (Ver. 1.06).  The scenario involves the release of 91,800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, liquefied under pressure, which represents release of anhydrous ammonia in an amount equal to the maximum capacity of the container.  Default assumptions for the RMP COMP software were used: 77 degrees F, 3.4 MPH wind speed, and stability class F.  In addition, an urban setting was used (based on actual site conditions), and no mitigation measures were included.  The release duration was 10 minutes.  The toxic endpoint for this scenario is 4.4 miles (7.1 kilometers).   138 people reside within this distance from the anhydrous ammonia container.\n\nAlternative Scenario.
