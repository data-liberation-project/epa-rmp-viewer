      "SummaryText": "The Wilbur-Ellis Shafter Facility Administrative Office is located in Shafter, California, approximately 5 miles west of the Shafter Minter Field. \r\n\r\nThe facility has developed a Risk Management Program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785), and Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Plan requirements (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Chapter 1, Part 68). The facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The facility staff is highly trained and utilizes log sheets and employee rounds to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe facility has a long standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia systems. The facility's policy is to implement reasonable standard operating procedures and maintenance tasks to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia are received, stored, and distributed directly to area farmers for the direct application as an agricultural nutrient.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per CalARP/EPA RMP regulations a worst-case analysis has been defined for the anhydrous ammonia system.

The worst-case release scenarios are highly unlikely to occur because of active and passive mitigation measures that are available and used, and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled for the CalARP/EPA RMP Program 3 substance: anhydrous ammonia. The meteorological conditions consistent with regulatory requirements for alternative release scenarios were used.\r\nRMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distances for the anhydrous ammonia scenario. The theory behind the CAMEO Evaporation Calculator was also used for the anhydrous ammonia scenario. The downwind distance for the alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks and worst-case release scenario can potentially reach the community; the facility has recognized these potential risks and\r\nstructured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the facility and facility personnel that make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model). In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-pred"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. As ammonia is self-alarming due to its pungent odor, even minor releases are readily noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements applied to the anhydrous ammonia processes include:\r\n\r\n\u00bfProcess Safety Information\r\n\u00bfProcess Hazards Analysis\r\n\u00bfOperating Procedures\r\n\u00bfTraining\r\n\u00bfMechanical Integrity\r\n\u00bfCompliance Audits\r\n\u00bfIncident Investigation\r\n\u00bfEmergency Planning & Response\r\n\u00bfEmployee Participation\r\n\u00bfHot Work\r\n\u00bfContractors\r\n\u00bfManagement of Change\r\n\u00bfPre-Startup Safety Review\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no CalARP/EPA RMP applicable releases of anhydrous ammonia at the facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility. These studies include the following: Hazard Review and Hazard Assessment. Any outstanding recommendations from these studies will have been addressed by October 18, 2013."
