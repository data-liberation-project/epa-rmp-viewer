      "SummaryText": "Dolco Packaging\nMemphis, TN\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Dolco are addressed in the Plant Emergency Response and Contingency Plan and Risk Management Plan. In brief, the policies include periodic inspection and documentation of the integrity of the difluoroethane storage and delivery system. The facility maintains a listing of emergency response numbers. This list includes the local as well as state response activities. The primary objective of the plan is to protect the health and well being of facility employees. Thus, any detected release would first result in evacuation and modification to potentially affected personnel and public receptors.\n\nThe company uses difluoroethane (CAS# 75-37-6) in compound mixes as a blowing (expanding) agent in the production of foam containers. The difluoroethane is stored in one above ground storage tank located on the northeast portion of the property. The area is secured with six foot high chain link fence and gate. Access into the storage area is limited to only authorized personnel. The tank is on a concrete saddle and concrete pad.  As part of the release prevention and emergency response policies, no more than 85% of the storage capacity is utilized. This protects against expansion and release of material. The storage system consists of one external steel tank connected to the process by piping and valving.. The system was designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with the storage and use requirements of the Steel Tank Institute. As furtherance of these policies, difluoroethane sensors have been installed within and without the facility to warn of any releases. In addition, the company has acquired a portable sensing device and conducts facility wide testing. Any indications of a release would result in evacuation of the facility and notification to the local response authorities. \n\nThe distance to the flammability endpoint for a worst case and alternate case release scenario"

      "SummaryText": "was calculated using RMP*COMP. This assessment has determined that the distance to a public receptor is within the range of the impact area. Maintaining storage capacity at 85% provides for expansion and contraction of stored liquids in a controlled manner. \n\nThere have been no significant accidental releases involving difluoroethane within the last five years that resulted in on or off site fatalities, major property damage or significant environmental damage.\n\nThe plan is reviewed through the use of Compliance audits (every three years), Process Hazard Analsysi (every five years)  and Maintenance Inspection forms through an outside agent familiar with Steel Tank Storage Requirements (every three years). Any suggestions or recommendations resulting from those inspections will result in a review of the various response plans. In addition, there is a facility accident investigation program that requires the facility manager to review and amend the response plans as necessary.\n\nThe major hazard associated with difluoroethane is flammability. Therefore, the storage and dispensing systems were designed to prevent leakage. All piping, regulators and other apparatus are kept tight and confirmed through the use of a compatible leak solution or leak detection instruments.\n\nSpecific employee response actions, to be taken in the event of a spill or release, require immediate notification to the facility manager. The facility manager, or his designee, will notify the regulatory and response authorities immediately. If a minor leak, spill or release, or fire occurs, the individual discovering the incident should attempt to locate and eliminate the source. This is only to be attempted when there is no risk to the individual or fellow employees, the proper safeguards are used and the person is properly trained and knowledgeable of the system. If the source is not obvious, and the situation presents an imminent danger, then that individual must initiate the emergency response not"
