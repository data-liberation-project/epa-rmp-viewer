Acrylonitrile is the only RMP regulated toxic material present in amounts greater than the threshold quantity.  There are no RMP regulated flammable materials present as pure components, or in mixtures, in amounts greater than the threshold quantities, that are used or stored at the SABIC facility. The facility\u0092s covered processes meet Program Level Three requirements.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by SABIC.   These high standards include: \n\u0095\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\u0095\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that the risk of unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u0095\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that promotes the health and safety of all employees, contractors , and visitors. \n\u0095\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\nThe outstanding safety programs at the Bay St. Louis facility have earned OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR status, presented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for exemplary safety management. This is OSHA\u0092s highest recognition for safety performance. This OSHA Program includes agency revalidation audits every 3-5 years. The Bay St. Louis facility has been an OSHA VPP Star site since 1993, with the most recent OSHA program review in March 2023.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe SABIC Facility is operatin"

Management and employee commitment to ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training, and emphasis on safety have all helped prevent serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to reduce the risk of potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\u0095\tComputer-controlled safety systems on their chemical reaction vessels to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected.\n\u0095\tSafety procedures that reduce the potential for human error which could lead to storage tank overfill.\n\u0095\tSecondary containment dikes around storage tanks to contain a spill.\n\u0095\tSpill containment around unloading stations to mitigate the impact of a leak.\n\u0095\tExtensive safety information about the processes available to employees.\n\u0095\tWritten operating procedures that include emergency response actions.\n\u0095\tComprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistently safe work practices.\n\u0095\tPreventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\u0095\tSafety procedure to review proposed plant modifications before they are implemented for possible hazards (Management of Change).\n\u0095\tSafety pre-qualification for all contractors.\n\u0095\tSafety reviews prior to startup of all processes.\n\u0095\tSafety permitting procedures that control hazards during special operations such as welding (Hot Work) and other maintenance activities.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWithin the last five years, there have been no releases of RMP Regulated Substances that resulted in onsite injuries, death or property damage or any offsite impacts.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGR"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Hancock County Sheriff\u0092s Department,   and other coordinating agencies, and local hospitals.  The Bay St. Louis facility Health & Safety Leader   is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Planning & Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Planning & Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\u0095\tThe Management of Change (MOC) provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedures are considered.\n\u0095\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u0095\tThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions at the SABIC Facility that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\u0095\tContinuing development of best management practices under OSHA\u0092s Voluntary Protection Program.\n\u0095\tInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\u0095\tContinuing an employee exposure monitoring program"
