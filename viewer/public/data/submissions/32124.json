The Facility Policy:\n\nThe Facility owner, management, and employees of ConAgra International Fertilizer are \ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local \nresponders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and include sections of the \nmanagement plan in those meetings. The Facility incorporates an internal written emergency \ncontingency plan at the location.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is \nprepared to work with local fire departments, and authorities to mitigate any release, and \nto minimize the impact of a release on the population and environment.\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to provide agricultural fertilizer for the farming \nindustry in the area.  Part of the fertilizer comes in the form of Anhydrous Ammonia, \nhere after referred to as ammonia.  Ammonia is received, store, and used for production \nof  liquid fertilizer solutions. Ammonia is an important source of Nitrogen for agricultural \ncrops.\n \nThe maximum quantity that can be stored in the stationary vessel is 170,000 pounds. \nThere are times that rail cars of ammonia are received and unloaded as the product is \nproduced.  It is not a practice to hold the car(s) any longer than necessary. The typical                                                    method of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing 40,000 pounds. The process                                                      is considered a batch process and operates from time to time.\n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n   \nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards           \nInstitute \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" \nK61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2.

The Facility tries to minimize the amount of \nammonia held or stored at the facility through management judgment. The Facility \ncontinues to review and look for means to improve operating and Best management \nPractices for increase safety. The Facility is regulated by State ammonia regulations.\n\nIV. The Five Year Accident History:\n       \nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia related to the operation of this facility \nin the past five years.  There have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage \nat the Facility.  To the best of our knowledge, no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, \nsheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage has occurred due to the \noperation of this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography / References:\nTechnical Inc. prepared for NIOSH, HAZOP of  \"Anhydrous Ammonia Use in \nAgricultural\" 1991.\n\nClements Associates, Inc., Fairfax, VA;  \"Health Effects for Ammonia, prepared for The \nFertilizer Institute.\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \"Chemical Emergency Preparedness and \nPrevention Advisory ?
