The RMP established three levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed for no impact facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\r\n\r\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tUse of regulated substances in threshold quantities\r\n\u00bf\tImpact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\r\n\u00bf\tNorth American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\r\n\u00bf\tFive-year accident history\r\n\u00bf\tOSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119 applicability\r\n\r\nCentennial Energy, LLC (Centennial) has reviewed the regulations and believes that transloading operations do not meet the definition of a Stationary source (\u00a768.3).  In deference to their partners at this site, Centennial has prepared this RMP under Program 3 requirements because:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tThe site handles a Liquidifed Petroleum Gas (LPG), including propane, butane, or a mixture of these gases in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs).\r\n\u00bf\tA release from this facility could impact an offsite public receptor (e.g. residence).\r\n\u00bf\tThe site maintains an OSHA PSM because propane and LPG are flammable gases/liquids which are handled in quantifies greater than 10,000 pounds and the facility is normally occupied.\r\n\r\nElements required by USEPA 40 CFR 68 Subparts B through H for Program 3 are presented in Sections 2 through 10 of this document and the Appendices.\r\n\r\n1.1\t\u00a768.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nCentennial has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.

The basic aspects of this program include: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tConducting training:\r\n\u00bf\tDeveloping written procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPerforming inspections and tests;\r\n\u00bf\tCorrecting identified deficiencies; and\r\n\u00bf\tApplying quality assurance measures. \r\n\r\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Maintenance personnel receive training on the following to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProcess overview;\r\n\u00bf\tSafety and health hazards;\r\n\u00bf\tApplicable maintenance procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response plans; and\r\n\u00bf\tApplicable safe work practices.\r\n\r\nWritten procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for piping). If a deficiency is identified, employees (or third party contractors) will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Centennial incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Sand Springs Transloading Site has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tControl of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel;\r\n\u00bf\tA lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Sand Springs Transloading Site which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is a LPG railcar. This vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a regulated flammable substance that could hypothetically be released and have offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees, third party contractors, and the public, any inventory of regulated toxic substances is maintained below the threshold quantity.

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, Centennial has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. Centennial ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nCentennial also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Sand Springs Transloading Site has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in pla"

      "SummaryText": "and the final resolution of the action tasks will be documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Sand Springs Transloading Site maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup following an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Centennial maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nCentennial has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees and third-party contractors involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in transloading operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator,"

      "SummaryText": "ce to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nCentennial primarily uses the What-if/Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of Centennial personnel and/or third party contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This PHA (Process Hazards Analysis) Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions. Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks - as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management. This risk reduction ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nPeriodically, Centennial updates and revalidates the initial PHA to ensure that process controls remain technologically adequate, and that process hazards are minimized and are within acceptable company risk tolerances. The PHA Revalidation verities that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features. These periodic revalidations/reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. As with the initial analysis, the PHA Team findings/recommendations will be forwarded to corporate management for approval/revision,"

Because these contractors work on or near process equipment, the site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPerform their work in a safe manner;\r\n\u00bf\tHave the appropriate knowledge and skills;\r\n\u00bf\tAre aware of the hazards in their workplace;\r\n\u00bf\tUnderstand what they should do in the event of an emergency;\r\n\u00bf\tUnderstand and follow site safety rules; and \r\n\u00bf\tInform Centennial personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tA process overview;\r\n\u00bf\tInformation about safety and health hazards;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response plan requirements; and\r\n\u00bf\tSafe work practices prior to their beginning work. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Centennial evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Centennial personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nCentennial conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nCentennial established practices and procedures to maint"
