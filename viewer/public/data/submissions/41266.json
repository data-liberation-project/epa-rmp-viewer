      "SummaryText": "The Town of Pulaski water treatment plant uses chlorine to disinfect its water supply. One ton cylinders are used and stored inside the chlorine building.  Inventory includes four to five cylinders, three in storage,one in use and one on stand-by. Safety equipment, chlorinators, and spare parts are also in this building.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis considers two chlorine release scenarios. \"Worst case release\" and \"alternative release\". The \"wost case scenario\" is described by the EPA as \"The owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the larges vessel is released as a gas over a ten minute period of time\". The \"alternative release\" is defined as \"more likely to occur\".\n\nWorst case scenario- Failure of a 2000 pound cylinder over a ten minute span, 200lb/min. Using RMP comp. calculations, this would result in toxic endpoint at  0.9 miles from chlorine building.\n\nAlternative release scenario- Failure of a regulator diafragm. 2,000 pound cylinder, release of 37 lb/min for ten minutes RMP Comp. calculation results in toxic endpoint at 0.1 mile radius around chlorine building.\n\nChlorine cylinders are always within this building. A chlorine monitor is located within the chlorine room. If a leak is detected it triggers an alarm on the SCADA system at the plant. If alarm is not acknowledged at the plant the SCADA calls to notify proper persons.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases whithin the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program for this facilityhas been reviewed by the Pulaski County LEPC. The program includes an evacuation plan. Chemical specific prevention steps include the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus(scba) and two chlorine institute emergency kits \"B\" for chlorine ton cylinders."
