The Cooperative has a policy of  adhereing to federal and state regulations in order to prevent unncessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community. Anyhydrous Ammonia is stored and distributed at this facility for agricultural producers. The anhydrous ammonia is received by transport truck and stored in a 12,000 gallon tank. The anhydrous ammonia is then distributed to to agricultural producers for direct application as a crop nutrient. The worst case scenario would be the failure of the our cooperatives 12,000 gallon Anhydrous Ammonia  tank. This tank when filled to 85% would release 48,000 pounds. The anhydrous ammonia would be released as a gas over a 10 minute period. The distance to the end point would be .80 miles. The alternate scenario would a hose breaking releasing 2400 pounds of product. The release is stopped by human intrvention in 2 minutes. The distance to the end point under urban conditions would be .30 miles. \nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Rules and with applicable state codes and regulations.\nThe cooperative has not had a accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to the knowledge of the company , have resulted in any off site deaths or injuies, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.Burnett Dairy Cooperative is committed to safetyfor its employees, customers and community."
