The flow of process water through an injector creates a vacuum in the chlorine supply line and mixes the chlorine gas with the process water.  If the water to the ejector is stopped for any reason, or the vacuum is lost, the spring-loaded gas inlet valve immediately closes to isolate the chlorinator from the chlorine gas supply.  The average chlorine usage is 70 pounds per day.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nAccidental releases of chlorine are prevented by routine training and adhering to the written operating procedures that cover the chlorination system from the unloading of chlorine containers through the mixing of chlorine gas with the process water.  These procedures cover normal operations and emergency operations where personnel may have to respond to an accidental release of chlorine.  The chlorine system is inspected at least once per shift (usually more often) and leak testing is performed on the valves and fittings when ton containers are changed-out and at other times if a leak is suspected. Employees that are responsible for disconnecting empty containers and connecting filled containers to the chlorination system have been trained on the operating procedures, inspection of valves, fittings, and the connected piping, and leak testing with an aqueous ammonia solution.  Aqueous ammonia reacts with chlorine gas to form a very visible white cloud.  An outside contractor inspects the chlorination system and performs preventive maintenance on the system.  This insures that work or damaged parts are replaced and routine maintenance is performed on the chlorinators and other equipment.  These preventive measures have resulted in the absence of any accidental release of chlorine that resulted in personal injury or property damage since the treatment plant began operation. \n\nThe treatment plant utilizes full-face respirators equippe"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary, Pennsylvania American Water, RMP Submission\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response policies at Pennsylvania American Water\n\nPennsylvania American Water is committed to safety and follows the concept that safety is never compromised.  This is evidenced through their daily activity, their excellent relationship regarding safety with the operator's union and union stewards, and their excellent safety record. Management's philosophy includes never storing more chemical on site than is needed. For the chlorine usage and storage area they limit access to this area to workers trained in the usage of chlorine; the buddy system is used when change-out of chlorine cylinders is required; even though chlorine monitoring equipment is in continuous use and if any safety equipment beyond that required or available is requested by operations, it is supplied. \n\nFacility Description and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPennsylvania American Water treats approximately 6.9 million gallons per day of raw wastewater at their treatment plant. The chlorine used at the plant is for the purpose of disinfecting the treated water, or effluent, as it leaves the plant.  The chlorine is supplied in one-ton containers.  A maximum of three one-ton containers of liquid chlorine are stored on the site.  This is the only chemical substance at this facility that is regulated under the USEPA Accidental Release Prevention Program.\nChlorine containers are thoroughly inspected for mechanical integrity and leaking valves prior to accepting the containers from the supplier.  The containers are off-loaded from the delivery truck at the treatment plant by an overhead crane with a lifting beam that is specially designed for the one-ton containers.  The off-loaded containers are also inspected by Pennsylvania American Water personnel.  There are two identical systems that can deliver chlorine gas, at the correct flow rate to the wastewater to be disinfected.  One system is normally active"

The Emergency B Kit equipment is stored in a room that is adjacent to the chlorinator room where the one-ton containers are located.    Pennsylvania American Water personnel receive regular training on the use of the respirators that are utilized. An electronic monitor continuously measures chlorine levels in the storage room and activates an alarm if chlorine is sensed. If the operators do not respond to the alarm in a predetermined length of time, then an auto-dialer is activated which dials a preset list of phone numbers in a particular sequence and at preset timed intervals.\n\nThe Emergency B Kit contains the necessary tools and other equipment to contain valve leaks and repair small holes in a ton container, and capping devices for the fusible plugs in each end of the containers.  \nThe chlorine storage area is equipped with a properly designed exhaust fan/ fresh air intake system.  The fan can be activated by a switch located outside the building.  One exit door is provided in the chlorine storage room.\n \nFive Year Accident History\n \nPennsylvania American Water has not had a reportable release of chlorine in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Pennsylvania American Water and the Local Emergency Planning Committee for the Emergency Planning district of Butler County have developed an Off-Site Response Plan in the event of an accidental release of chlorine at the treatment plant.  This plan was developed in accordance with the provisions set forth in Title III of the Superfund Amendments and the Reauthorization Act of 1986.  The plan assigns release response procedures to the emergency coordinator at the Pennsylvania American Water, Butler County Emergency Control, South Butler and the Lyndora Fire Departments, Local Police, Emergency Medical Services, and the Butler County Emergency Management Coordinator.

      "SummaryText": "ted as necessary, including the list of emergency telephone numbers.  The South Butler Fire Department has visited the treatment plant on several occasions along with the City of Butler Bureau of Fire. If a chlorine leak develops in a ton-container or in the connected piping, valves, or other equipment, a chlorine monitor in the chlorine storage area will activate an audible alarm in both this area and in the remotely located control room building. Along with the alarm the chlorine system is equipped with an emergency shut down system called a Halogen Valve System. If an alarm occurs the Halogen System will actuate on the valve of the 1-ton cylinder stopping the inadvertent release of chlorine. The control room is manned 24 hours/day and seven days/week.  The treatment plant emergency operating procedures will be followed to determine the severity of the chlorine release and whether the gas may migrate off-site.  If the chlorine release may travel off-site, then the Off-site Response Plan will be activated.  If the chlorine release does not pose a threat to the general public and is below the exposure threshold put in place by OSHA, Pennsylvania American Water personnel will enter with correct PPE to make repairs. If levels are above the threshold set forth by OSHA then an emergency hazmat contractor will respond to the leak.  Pennsylvania American Water has windsocks installed at 2 locations near the chlorine building to determine the wind direction and the area that is likely to be affected by a chlorine release.  An autodialer is installed as a backup response system. If the monitors sense chlorine and set off the alarm, the autodialer begins to dial an established list of phone numbers, beginning with the operators/control room. A preset amount of time is given for the operators to respond. If the operators do not respond, then the dialer calls the other numbers to alert appropriate management/authorities that a potential chlorine release condition exists."
