If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and transferred for use as a crop production nutrient.\n\nThe maximum quantity handled would be the 141,993# stored in our three storage tanks. We also have 30 units of rolling stock that have a combined capacity of 131,070# for a total on site of 273,063. \n\nThe worst-case scenario and alternative scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  The local first responders shall receive any needed information.  \n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61/1\" and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture inspects our plants on an annual basis.  We also meet the current underwriting guidelines of Farmland Insurance and undergo annual loss control surveys based on both physical property and safety/operational procedures.  NOTE:  The Kansas Department of Ag has not yet adopted the most current version of the ANSI standard.  As the new version is adopted this company will budget the necessary time and money needed to complete any needed updates.\n\nOur firm has an outstanding safety record at this location.  In the past five years we have had no reportable accidents nor to our knowledge have we had any off-site deaths, injuries, sheltering in place, evacuations or environmental damage.  \n\nWe consider training to be our greatest administrative control.  We rotate our employees on a three-year basis and send them to NH3 schools that we fee"

We have implemented Standard Operating Procedures that are written down for the benefit of our new employees, as well as Standard Maintenance Procedures.  \n\nOur firm has a detailed emergency action plan, which OSHA requires. As required by 29CFR1910.120(P)(8) the Emergency Response Plan is not needed.  Our employees are trained to evacuate the area should an emergency release occur.  Employees are trained on basic first aid for victims, where to evacuate too, and how to notify first responders.   \n\nWe report to the county, state and local fire department chemical inventories and locations as required by The Community Right-to-Know\" rules and regulations.  \n\nSafety improvements are an ongoing process at our firm.  We are dedicated to safely serving our customers and protecting the employees that work for us.  Training, equipment and maintenance are of the highest quality and design.  We order all parts from an industry specialist to insure that they are approved parts for the process.  At this time there are no specific upgrades planned.  We are proud of our efforts and proud to serve the communities in which we operate."
