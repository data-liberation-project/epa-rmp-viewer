Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Nulex, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such an unforeseeable release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Salix Fire Department and the Sioux City Hazardous Material Response Team which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We have conducted joint training with the outside agencies and both local hospitals.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facilityA?s primary activities encompass the production of zinc based micro-nutrients for fertilizer and animal feed supplements.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia, which is involved in two uses.  Ammonia is used to control the pH and to react with zinc, sulfur, and chlorides to form the zinc amine complex for our products.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 67690 pounds.\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  We also have an air opera"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the HazOp.  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Nulex, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  This information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nNulex, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nNulex, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operat"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Nulex, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modification.  Contractor personnel affected by the changes are also made aware of and given training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Nulex, Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nNulex, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  The HS&E Department also conducts routine audits. This facility also participated in an EPA Chemical Safety Audit and an IOSHA Consultation Compliance Audit.\n\nIncident Investigation\nNulex, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nNulex, Inc. truly believes that process safety management"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Nulex, Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractorA?s work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History\nNulex, Inc. has a good record of preventing accidental releases of ammonia over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, only one accidental release of ammonia has occurred during this period.  This incident was the result of human error and failure to follow procedures.  There were no injuries but outside agencies did respond.\n\n\n5.
