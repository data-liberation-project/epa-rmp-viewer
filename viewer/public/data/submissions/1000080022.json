      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Perry's Ice Cream plant uses Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) as a heat transfer fluid in the plant refrigeration system.  The system is a two stage mechanical refrigeration system which achieves just under 1,900 Tons of Refrigeration (TR) compression.  The closed loop uses both liquid pumped over feed and flooded systems.  The system operates at a Low Stage Saturated Suction Pressure of 12\" Hg.  The Intermediate Stage Saturated Suction pressure is 15 psig.  The Saturated Discharge Pressure is 120 psig.  The system is controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller and notification alarms via cell phone are distributed to all appropriate Team Members to address any adverse situation.  The plant is occupied by qualified technicians every day of the year except New Year's Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day, as the refrigeration system must operate to protect the quality of the frozen products.  The plant has systems that are monitored by an off - site monitoring company, which is on duty 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\n\n\nA.  Description of the Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nPIC takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  PIC has also implemented a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified associates, and emergency procedures designed to enable trained associates to respond quickly to system upsets.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source is the Perry's Ice Cream Co"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has a PSM/RMP Program that complies with both OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program and also serves as the Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The PSM/RMP Program consists of the following elements:\n\nManagement Systems\n\nEmployee Participation Program\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining Program\n\nContractor Safety Program\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\nMechanical Integrity Program\n\nHot Work Permit Procedures\n\nManagement of Change Procedures\n\nIncident Investigation Procedures\n\nCompliance Audit Procedures\n\nEmergency Action Procedures\n\nHazard Assessment\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\n\n\n\n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have not been any ammonia-related accidents at the facility over the past five years that resulted in offsite consequences as outlined in the Accident History Section of the RMP Submittal.\n\n\n\n\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been implemented at the facility.  The EAP contains procedures describing how the facility will react to ammonia spills or releases and other potential emergencies, including both shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with local response agencies. \n\n\n\n\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nWe have identified potential changes to improve the safety of our ammonia refrigeration system by conducting both Compliance Audit and a PHA Revalidation which generated recommendations to improve the safety of the system.  All recommendations are documented through meeting notes and/or action lists associated with the PSM/RMP Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
