Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\nIt is the policy of the Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., Boise, Idaho facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Tyson employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all Tyson owned activities at this facility.\nTyson's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n2.  Facility Description\nTyson Fresh Meats, Inc. operates a cattle slaughter and processing facility and a wastewater treatment plant at this location.  Cattle are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  Tyson operates rendering systems to produce dried blood, meat and bonemeal byproducts, and tallow.  Support operations include a wastewater treatment system, cold storage, and administrative offices.\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Boise, Idaho facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment"
