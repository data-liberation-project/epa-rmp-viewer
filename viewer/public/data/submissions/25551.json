If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Coal City Fire Department, Grundy County Emergency Planning Committee, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located on Gorman Road, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  The storage and handling systems consist of 26,000 gallon storage tank, riser, and associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantityof anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 178,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 2.5 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  Emergency shut down procedures, which include the closing of tank valves, was the only active mitigation considered to limit the amount of product released.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is 0.4 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Ruls and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Req"

Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of out employees make up out accident release prevention program.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; not\n-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has:\n-a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is out policy to notify the Coal City Fire Department and GRundy County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have veen coordinated with the fire department and LEPC.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe condidtions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
