Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan is written in the format of the EPA's One Plan or Integrated Contingency Plan. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including rescue and follow up first aid or medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies, and the public. Included are specific procedures for the RMP regulated substance, 2-Methylpropene. The emergency equipment is regularly inspected and tested.\r\n\r\nThe Cocke County Emergency Management Agency Director, local police, local hospital and the Cocke County Fire Chief have been provided a copy of the plan and are familiar with the plant site. The Cocke County Fire Chief and the State Fire Marshall have also reviewed the NFPA 58 Fire Safety Analysis for storage of the 2-Methylpropene. \r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAn improvement to the fire protection system by adding additional sprinkler heads to provide cooling water for vertical steel columns is completed. Building 22 Control Room Fire Suppression System has been activated. Monitor nozzles have been upgrade and new fire suppression foam has been added to inventory."

This chemical is a byproduct of the chemical production process and is more commonly called isobutylene.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility is operated to comply with OSHA PSM 29 CFR 1910.119, which includes designs and mechanical integrity based on ASME standards. The operating procedures specifically address release prevention of the substance according to OSHA PSM. The site is also subject to control requirements under the EPA Title V Air Permit Program. The 2-Methylpropene storage and transfer facilities are designed according to NFPA 58 (Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code). Pressure vessels are designed and tested according to State of Tennessee regulations on boilers and pressure vessels. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information.\r\nSI Group Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating safety information, operating parameters, and equipment designs.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nSI Group Inc. has conducted and will revalidate as needed, comprehensive studies to ensure hazards are identified and controlled. The methodology used to carry out the analyses are HAZOP and what if checklists. In addition, based on the PHA findings, further evaluations are conducted using a Layer Of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to determine if additional controls are needed per a Safety Instrumented System (SIS). The methods are based on the IEC 61511 Functional safety -Safety instrumented systems for the process industry 2003-01. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  Consequences of deviation and emergency procedures are included.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nThe SI Group Inc. emergency response personnel are organized into teams with an Incident Commander per each shift.

These audits will be repeated at least every three years. SI Group has been recertified in 2016 to the Tennessee Star VPP Program. SI Group Newport has been a member of this exclusive group since 2013. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nEmployees participated in the PHA and pre-startup safety reviews as well as contributed to modifying the design and procedures for the safest operation.

This commitment is reinforced by compliance with the OSHA PSM requirements through a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.      \r\n\r\nSI Group Inc. is highly committed to decreasing the likelihood that a release will occur, but unforeseeably if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel in coordination with the Cocke County Emergency Management Agency will control and mitigate the effects of the release.  At SI Group Inc., control is implemented by applying six layers of protection.  \r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\r\nThe first layer of protection is comprised of our employees who are highly trained to utilize the distributive control system to safely operate the process.  The second line of defense is implementation of our Mechanical Integrity Program which complies with the OSHA PSM rules and ensures integrity and preventative maintenance on the equipment.  Thirdly, Hazard Reviews through HAZOP Process Hazard Analysis have been conducted by examining all process procedures and equipment. The process controls and devices such as relief control valves and flares, make up the fourth layer of protection.  Backing up the controls is the monitoring system, which includes continual data readout by operators in the control room. A sixth layer of protection is provided by our Emergency Response team, which has at its disposal equipment sufficient to control a release. \r\nThe Cocke County Fire Department is familiar with our facility and can provide prompt backup.     \r\n\r\n2.
