Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2) Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 224,000 pounds in the facility 's two tanks.  Along with 70,000  pounds stored in 15 smaller tanks.\n\n\n\n3) The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tanks at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.164 miles.  \n\n\n\n The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1 inch transfer hose, with 12,000 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .56 mile.\n\n\n\n4) The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by Indiana State Chemist are  consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OHSA 29 CFR 1910.111 Regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5) The Five Year Accident History: There"

Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.    \n\n\n\n7) Planned changes to improve safety: Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations, There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time. \n\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
