Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCentral Cold Storage conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCentral Cold Storage uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Drawings R-2 and 3 in Appendix A.2* show the facility location map and site plan, respectively.\n\nThe ammonia system is used for food processing and freezer storage. The original freezer building was constructed in 1975 and the additions were built in 1981 and 1985. Refrigeration coils for room cooling were added to National Custom Packing (NCP) processing rooms and were  tied into CCS refrigeration system. The coils were added to NCP 2 in 1999 and to NCP 1 in 2002. The total charge for the refrigeration system is approximately 16,000 lb.\n\nThe refrigeration system at this facility is a single-stage v"

In general, the process chemistry for this system is shown in Section V.A.2 of the hard copy RMP.\n\nA list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found on drawing R-1 located in Appendix A.2*. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix A.1*, describe equipment details. Drawing R-4 in Appendix A.2* shows the refrigeration equipment layout.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4.i* for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCentral Cold Storage maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation*.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monit"

All relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n\n\n4.    Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Central Cold Storage personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety/Sanitation Supervisor is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety/Sanitation Supervisor will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Appendix N*.\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the PHA and safety inspection are listed in the Appendixes* as \"Correction Items\". All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n\n\n*Drawings, figures and references can be found in the hard copy RMP on site.\n\n"
