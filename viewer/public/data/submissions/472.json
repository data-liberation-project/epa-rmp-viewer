It is the policy of the Cameron Water Department to provide its employees with a safe\nand healthful work environment and to conduct its operations in such a  manner as to have\nminimal impact on the environment and the  surrounding community.  Every effort has been made\nto provide the greatest degree of safety possible for city employees and the citizens of Cameron. \nThis Risk Management Plan includes all elements of the EPA regulations. including developing a\nprocess hazard analysis, standard operating procedures for the water treatment process, employee\ntraining programs, and preventive maintenance schedules.

This is accomplished through the use of chlorine gas as a\ndisinfecting agent of the water supply.  Chlorine gas is stored in one ton containers and is fed to\nvarious stages of the treatment process through a chlorination system. The maximum amount of\nchlorine in storage at the water treatment plant  is three tons, in one ton containers.

The preventive maintenance program is intended to insure\nthe continued integrity of process equipment and to minimize the risk of a catastrophic chlorine\nrelease.  This preventive maintenance program requires regular  inspection and testing of\nchlorination equipment by the Water Department employees.  The Water Department has an\nemployee training program which includes all topics necessary for the safe operation and\nmaintenance of the water treatment plant.  All affected personnel receive training at the time of\ntheir initial assignment and whenever there is a process modification or alteration of the operating\nprocedures, or change in individual job duties.  \n\nIt is the belief of the Water Department that compliance audits would be helpful in evaluating the\neffectiveness of the risk management program.  It is the opinion of the city of Cameron Water\nDepartment that audits conducted at regular intervals by a multi-disciplinary employee-\nmanagement team, and a review by that team of the risk management program in force at the time \nfor effectiveness and applicability, making recommendations for changes and revisions, as\nnecessary would be beneficial.  \n\n                Five-year Accident Plant History\n\nThere been no chlorine releases at the Cameron Water Treatment Facility during the five-year\nperiod preceding the date of this report which resulted in death or injury to water division\npersonnel or to the general public, significant property or environmental damage on and  off-site.\n\n\n Worst case  release scenario and alternative release scenario\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, a one ton container of chlorine is dropped during delivery operations. \nThe container ruptures upon impact with a concrete loading area and releases 2,000 pounds of\nchlorine gas to the atmosphere.
