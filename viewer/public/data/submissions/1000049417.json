Executive Summary\r\nCalpine Garrison Energy Center, LLC (Calpine) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Calpine workers, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, Calpine has developed and implemented Environmental and Workplace Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all its employees and operations. Calpine believes that following these policies is the responsibility of every employee.\r\nAs part of this commitment, Calpine has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Calpine and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at Calpine. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Calpine.\r\nThe risk management program at Calpine consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tA hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\r\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\r\n3.\t \tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\r\nInformation further describing these elements is p"

      "SummaryText": "rovided in this RMP Plan.\r\n\r\nAlthough the risk management program at Calpine helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at Calpine. In fact, Calpine has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing various levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries/damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\r\nCalpine limits the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance at Calpine, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  Part of Calpine's RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, Calpine considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect Calpine workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\r\n\r\nCalpine works to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When a hazardous substance is used at Calpine, the equipment is designed, built, operated, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are adhered to in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the equipment.\r\n\r\nCalpine limits damage from a release, if such a release were to occur. Calpine trains workers to react quickly in the event of an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release were to occur. In addition, Calpine works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur.\r\nThe safety program at Calpine consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at Calpine that are required by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies"

      "SummaryText": "nd other properties depending upon the model\r\n\r\nIn addition to the physical parameters that characterize a release, meteorological data is needed by the model to characterize the ambient release conditions. Meteorological data is used in dispersion models to calculate the distance that the pollutant plume moves downwind and the concentration of the pollutant at any given time or distance. The meteorological variables that affect the dispersion of a chemical release are as follows:\r\n\r\n* Wind Speed and Direction: The wind speed is used to determine the plume dilution, plume transport, plume rise, evaporation rate, and magnitude of the concentration. Wind direction defines the direction in which the plume travels.\r\n* Temperature: Temperature is used to calculate plume rise and evaporation rates.\r\n* Atmospheric Pressure: is used to calculate gas and liquid release rates.\r\n* Atmospheric Stability: Stability is an indication of atmospheric turbulence. The turbulence is depended upon thermal (heating of the ground) and mechanical (surface roughness and wind speed) effects. Turbulence also acts to dilute the plume and reduce concentrations. For the RMP modeling performed the following meteorological parameters were used for the two scenarios:\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\r\n* Wind Speed: 1.5 meters/second\r\n* Stability:\tF\r\n* Temperature: 77 deg. F.\r\n* Land use: Rural \r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario:\r\n* Wind Speed: 5.0 meters/second\r\n* Stability: D\r\n* Temperature: 103 deg. F.\r\n* Land use: Rural\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.

Oral reviews, written tests and on-the-job training are used to verify that an employee understands the process operation prior to job assignment.\r\n\r\nThe operators are consulted annually during operating procedure reviews to evaluate the effectiveness and need for additional training. Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n5.\tMechanical Integrity: Calpine maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. This is accomplished by: (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes and (3) utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.\r\n\r\n6.\tManagement of Change: The Calpine management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a management of change form. All other changes must be reviewed through the full management of change program, to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\n7.\tPre-startup Review: Calpine"

The recommended response to a release is to shelter-in-place and to shut off any air intakes (e.g., air conditioners or fresh air make-up systems).\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Calpine. These requirements are:\r\n* One worst-case release scenario for each Program 1 process (the Garrison Energy Center does not have any processes meeting the Program 1 definition)\r\n* One worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing the Anhydrous Ammonia process)\r\n* One alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process (i.e. one scenario representing the Anhydrous Ammonia process)\r\n\r\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by Calpine. 1.3.1 Program 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a 12,000 gal (56,000 pound) Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank in the Anhydrous Ammonia System. The solution evaporates and forms a vapor cloud. The Anhydrous Ammonia would be released to atmosphere over a 10-minute period. The scenario results in off-site impacts to both public and environmental receptors.\r\nThe alternative release scenario for the Anhydrous Ammonia System is a dual phase release into the containment from the storage vessel. Operators would be notified of a release by Ammonia monitors located around the tank and throughout the process area. The containment area would limit the extent of spread of the liquid Ammonia. Conservatively, 50,000 pounds of Ammonia would be released from the time the incident began until it would all vapor"

The scenario results in off-site impacts to both public and environmental receptors.\r\n\r\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention\r\nThe Garrison Energy Center has always focused on ways to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established Program 2 and Program 3 prevention requirements, Calpine has implemented the Program 3 prevention requirements, which are as follows:\r\n\r\nProgram 3 - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment. Program 3 requires 12 of the 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulation, and is the most rigorous prevention program. It has been established for the Anhydrous Ammonia System. The following sections briefly describe the elements of Calpine's prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\r\nThe Garrison Energy Center Program 3 prevention program, which applies to the Anhydrous Ammonia System, consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tProcess Safety Information: Calpine maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the covered process. These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled in the process, (2) operating parameters of the equipment/process (including standard operating procedures (SOPs)) and (3) design basis and configuration of process equipment.\r\n\r\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the properties of hazardous substances handled at Calpine, including regulated substances in the covered process. Information on the technology and engineering design of the covered process includes the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nMany of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are used (1) to train emplo"

A team composed of personnel with engineering, process operating experience, maintenance, and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process. Calpine primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations. Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to area personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\r\n\r\n3.\tOperating Procedures: Calpine operators, process engineers and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and emergency operations.\r\nCalpine personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations. The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the covered processes and as a training guide for both new and experienced operators. Operating procedures are updated at least annually to ensure they reflect current operating conditions.\r\n\r\n4.\tTraining: The Garrison Energy Center trains workers to perform their assigned tasks safely and effectively.

      "SummaryText": "ease scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) improve community emergency response plans. An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Calpine's and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred. While Calpine believes that such releases are unlikely to occur at the Garrison facility, Calpine has evaluated the offsite impact of the releases in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nCalpine has conducted the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario using the EPA's guidance document and RMP*Comp that was developed to provide the highest estimate of the possible offsite consequences of such a release. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The model was developed to provide information on the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for a chemical of concern. Calpine has not conducted a more detailed analysis of these scenarios because the potential for such releases is unlikely and because more refined analysis of such events will not provide additional information that would be useful.\r\n\r\nWhile the model provides the required data to meet regulatory requirements, it does not provide detailed information on the travel time or concentration of the chemical in the plume. Typical information input to the model to characterize a chemical release is:\r\n\r\n* Physical State: gas, liquid, aerosol, and multi-phased\r\n* Release Type: continuous, instantaneous, point (stack releases), and area (releases from a pool)\r\n* Release Condition: height, substrate type (concrete, soil), area and height of curbing, exit velocity, release diameter, and exit temperature\r\n* Chemical Properties: molecular weight, specific gravity, vapor pressure, density, latent heat, a"

Topics include the PHAs and operating procedures; as well as access to any support information for the covered processes.\r\n\r\n11.\tHot Work Permits: Calpine uses a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions at the Garrison Energy Center. Calpine reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements. Personnel performing hot work are required to have an approved permit prior to beginning their work. Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the Calpine safe work practices orientation.\r\n\r\n12. \tContractors: Calpine has established Contractor Safety and Health Guidelines to outline expectations related to contractor work at the Garrison Energy Center including work on the covered process. The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that Calpine only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks. Calpine explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, Calpine safe work practices, and Calpine emergency response procedures. Calpine requires that the contractor supervisors also train each of their employees prior to beginning their work on a covered process. Calpine periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, Calpine has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the Garrison Energy Center. The Anhydrous Ammonia System has been designed to handle Anhydrous Ammonia. Calpine compared Anhydrous and Aqueous Ammonia and determined that Anhydrous Ammonia was more appropr"

The storage tank is engineered specifically for Anhydrous Ammonia service. The piping is double-contained, wrapped with corrosion protection tape, cathodically protected, and the interstitial space is charge with nitrogen and monitored. The process uses an advanced control system with emergency shutdowns to ensure safe operation. Detectors and alarms located around the tank, injection skids, and Heat Recovery Steam Generator provide continuous monitoring for Ammonia in the event of a release, providing early detection and helping to ensure quick response if an incident were to occur.\r\n\r\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\r\nCalpine is required to complete a review of the covered process for incidents occurring in the five-year period prior to the submittal date for the regulation. Since the system is new, there have been no incidents involving the regulated processes that have resulted in on-site or off-site impacts.\r\n\r\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\r\nCalpine has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. Calpine does not have First Responder capabilities. Calpine'sresponse will be to notify the LEPC and other off-site emergency response personnel in the event of serious incident or off-site impact.
