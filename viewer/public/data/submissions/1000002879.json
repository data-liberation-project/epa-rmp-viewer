To maintain frozen conditions in the warehouse, Exel operates a mechanical refrigeration system in which the refrigerant is anhydrous ammonia.  No manufacturing is done at the site, but wome final packaging of pre-made products is done on a contract basis.  Products are brought to the site by truck for storage;  various assortments of these products are then assembled for reshipment to area outlets.\n\nThis refrigeration plant was newly constructed in 1987.  Exel has long been committed to employee safety and to being a good community neighbor.  To this end, Exel maintains an active safety management program to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The facility complies with OSHA's PSM rule, and maintains a written Process Safety Plan onsite.  Periodic drills are conducted to ensure familiarity with all emergency procedures.\n\nA rigorous program of operator training, preventive maintenance, and periodic inspections is maintained, to prevent the accidental  release of ammonia, and all required safety programs are in force at the facility.  While the facility is a relatively new one, there have been no reportable accidental releases of ammonia since start-up, and no accidents involving the release of ammonia.  Exel has coordinated emergency response activities with the local (Manteno) Fire Department.  The nearest Fire Department Substation is less than one (1) mile distant.\n\nThe facility is located to the East of the Village of Manteno, in a county  location which remains rural in nature.  The refrigeration system is sized adequately for the amount of cooling needed, and is capable of holding 26,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  All ammonia is stored in the system; there is no additional storage on-site.\n\nExel personnel are trained to respond to minor releases and minor repair/maintenance problems.  However, for a major release, the facility would call upo"
