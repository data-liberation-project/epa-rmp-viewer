(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThis RMP is an initial submission for a newly-constructed fractionator located near Mont Belvieu, Texas.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Mont Belvieu Fractionation Facility (MB-2) receives raw feed via piping from an adjacent underground storage facility.  The raw feed is then fractionated into five purity products. These products are ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The products are returned to the storage facility via plant piping and stored until they are delivered via pipeline to third party customers.  Ethane, propane, isobutane and normal butane as well as two flammable mixtures, natural gasoline and raw feed, are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at MB-2.  No toxic chemicals are stored at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention"

      "SummaryText": " and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\n\n-    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n-    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n-    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n-    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe MB-2 Fractionator will operate under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety will help to avoid any serious accidents in the future.  Part of this program also involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n-    Minimizing the possibility that combustion of hydrocarbon vapors would be interrupted by installing automatic pilot ignition and a failure alarm on the flare.\n\n-    Installing hydrocarbon detectors at the facility to help ensure that a release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n\n-    Conducting preventive maintenance and vessel testing through the Mechanical Integrity program to help ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\n-    Providing employees and contractors with an orientation on facility operations to help ensure personal safety.\n\n-    Providing a fire water system to help ensure quick response to fires.\n\n-    Installing open path gas detectors to detect hydrocarbon releases.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAt the time of this RMP submittal, the facility is not yet ope"

      "SummaryText": "rational.  Since this is a new facility, no incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or significant property damage or known offsite impacts from a release of an RMP substance has occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAny emergency response necessary for the MB-2 Facility will be coordinated, as appropriate, with the Mutual Aid of Mont Belvieu (MAMB), the Mont Belvieu Fire Department, the Chambers County Sheriff and LEPC, the San Jacinto Hospital, and the Texas State Patrol.  The MB-2 Plant Manager, or his designee, is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\n\n-    The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n-    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n-    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\n\n-    Internal and third party compliance audits to ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated"
