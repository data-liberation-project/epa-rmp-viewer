The Columbus facility is a cold storage plant located two miles northwest of the downtown business district.   We currently have 272 employees.  Our plant refrigeration system uses Anhydrous Ammonia which is regulated by the EPA RMP.  The many programs utilized by RMP are part of what we do on a daily basis to make sure that we protect the community and our associates.  The many prevention programs utilized by RMP are also used in a vartiety of other ways in our facility to help us assure a safe and healthy work force.  As part of SYSCO, safety is our top priority and we expect to have the safest warehouse in the country.  --  \n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE: \n\n It is the policy of Abbott SYSCO to meet and exceed all requirements established by applicable safety, health and environmental regulations given to us by all state, local and federal agencies.  Our policy is to maintain at a pratical minimum the potential for harm to onsite employees and contractors, the public and the environment, and to have in place contigency actions coordinated with local responding agencies for the unlikely event of a serious accidnetal ammonia release.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAbbott SYSCO has in place a thorough and ongoing PSM program.  The program calls for the implemetation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards at the facility to minimize the likelihood of a significant release of ammonia and to eliminate or reduce the effects of any release that might occur.  We have invested and will continue to invest substantial effort and capital to make sure that we co"

We are involved iin the following activites on a daily basis that incorporate the elemnts of our RMP and PSM:\n1)  Process Hazard Analysis - We perform and maintain up to date reviews of our operations to identify what could go wrong and identlfy the necessary means to prevent the situation.  We also monitor our system and continuously improve its performance in the area of safety.\n2)  Process Design - Our systems and equipment are designed for safety in accordance with applicable industry standards and best engineering practices.  Designs include automatic emergency shutdowns, pressure relief devices, ventilation systems and release sensoring systems.  Our refrigeration system is computer controlled which includes internal checks for abnormal conditions.  Our storage vessels are located indoors and protected by a key card security system.\n3)  Training - Our associates and contractors are trained on their job tasks, safe work practices and emergency response actions.  Training is continuously reviewed and enhance by our safety departemnt.  Associates are trained on all required topics upon hire and then annually or before if needed.  Associates also participate in weekly safety meetings that cover a wide variety of safety materials.  \n4)  Maintenance - Each item of equipment that is involved in maintaining safety or in responding to an abnormal situation is inspected, tested and / or maintained on a frequency that reflects its service and condition.\n5)  Management of Change - No change to a piece of equipment or procedures can take place without a thorough review of the implications of that change to safety.  No change must adversly impact the safety built into the design and operations of our refrigeration system.  \n\nOur PSM program is tuned to reflect the hazards of Anhydrous Ammonia.

Also, our equipment is selected based on its intended service and chemical exposures including release detection devices.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDNET HISTORY\n\nWe have had no events at the Abbott SYSCO facility that would qualify for inclusion in the RMP 5 year accidnet history.  We have never had a reportable release of ammonia.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe have in place a written emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Franklin County LEPC and the Columbus Fire Department.  All new assocates, visitors and contractors are trained on the plan, and refresher training is conducted annually.  The plan itself is reviewed on an annual basis and is in accordance with all applicable local, state and federal regulations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOur safety program is an ongoing process involving the constant identification of all potentail hazards and threats and the elimination of these hazards.  We continue to work with our associates, contractors and community to make the necessary changes to enhance our safety program.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nUnder the RMP rule we have considered a worst case release scenario (WCS).  We believe this WCS to be extremely unlikely to occur.  It involves the spontaneous, catastrpohic failure of our largest storage vessel containing ammonia.  Based on the use of EPA offsite conseequence analysis tools, this scenario is determined to have offsite impact.  A more credible scenarion, called an alternative release scenario (ARS), was also analyzed.  \n\nAs required by the RMP rule we chose a hypothetical ARS that is severe enough to have an effect beyond our fenceline.  The selected ARS is also highly unlikely, and is guard                                                                                                                                                                      "
