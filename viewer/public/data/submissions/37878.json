This application uses the common practices and codes for a chlorinator system.  The equipment and materials used in this process are specific to this application and chlorine.  Safety devices includes the chlorine vacuum valve, it's controller, and area sensor interlocks.  The containers are dedicated in design and application to the chlorine industry, and are maintained by the supplying contractor.  These vessels have integral relief valves of the melting plug type, to prevent the overpressure in the event of a fire. Over filling on site is of no concern as the process starts with full containers supplied and weighed bythe supply contractor.  Safeties and check valves prevent reverse flow of the process.",
