      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nGarner Terminal\n\nBackground\n\nAgrium U.S. Inc. Garner Terminal stores liquid anhydrous ammonia in a pressure vessel within its facility.  The liquid anhydrous ammonia is pressurized and stored under atmospheric temperature.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia which can be stored in the pressure vessel is 165 tons.  The Garner Terminal received anhydrous ammonia from pipeline and stored it in the pressure vessel.  The anhydrous ammonia is then dispenses to tank trucks for fertilizer application.  Both of the transfer processes are accomplished with ammonia transfer pumps.  The Garner Terminal also stores propane in a pressure vessel for heating purpose.  The capacity of the pressure vessel is 18,000 gallons and the maximum fill level is 85%.  As the result, the maximum amount of propane can be stored in the Garner Terminal is 15,300 gallons.\n\nRationale for Risk Management Program Development and Implementation\n\nThe 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) require Environmental protection Agency (EPA) to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of substances into the atmosphere and reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment.  As the results of the 1990 Amendments, EPA issued the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" (part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) that requires affected facilities to develop and implement a risk management program.  The affected facilities include any facilities that handle, manufacture, store, or use above the specified threshold quantities of toxic substances in a process, including ammonia and propane.  The threshold quantities for ammonia and propane to trigger the development and implementation of a risk management program are 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe risk management program is designed to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposu"

Since Agrium is handling more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia and propane, it is required to develop and implement a risk management program.  The Agrium's risk management program includes an offsite consequence analysis of a potential accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nUnder the risk management program, an offsite consequence analysis is required for an accidental release of a regulated source.  In Agrium's case, anhydrous ammonia and propane are the regulated sources.  Modeling of the worst-case scenario and at least one alternative release scenario for each regulated source is required for offsite consequence analyses under this program.\n\nEPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The largest quantity is determined taking into account administrative controls that limit the quantity of a substance that can be stored or processed in a vessel or pipe at any one time, or alternatively, procedures that occasionally allow the vessel or pipe to store greater than usual quantities.  EPA defined alternative release scenarios to be any release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios and that reaches an endpoint offsite.\n\nFor offsite consequence analysis, the movement and dispersion of a regulated source release to the atmosphere is predicted using a computer model.  Agrium uses four (4) different models for this purpose.  The models used are The Fertilizer Inistitute's (AFI) Ammonia Tables, PHAST Professional Dispersion Model (version 5.20), TRC Environmental Corporation Model for Refrigerated Ammonia, EPA's RMP Comp software and the lookup tables in EPA's RMP Offiste Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG).

The scenario that resulted in the largest footprint in the event of an anhydrous ammonia release will be selected as the worst-case anhydrous ammonia release scenario for the Garner Terminal.  The propane worst-case release scenario is represented by the only scenario modeled.  The release scenarios modeled are summarized as follow:\n\n1. Complete failure of the ammonia pressure vessel resulting in the release of 165 tons of anhydrous ammonia.\n2. Failure of ammonia railcar resulting in the release of 80 tons of anhydrous ammonia.\n3. Failure of ammonia tanker truck resulting in the release of 20 tons of anhydrous ammonia.\n4. Complete failure of the pressurized propane vessel resulting in the release of 15,300 gallons of propane.\n\nBased on all of the information available, the offsite impacts from these release scenarios are predicted by the models.  All of the worst case release scenarios resulted in offsite impact.  The scenario resulted in the largest footprint for the anhydrous ammonia release is the complete failure of the ammonia pressure vessel resulting in the release of 165 tons of anhydrous ammonia.  The worst case release scenario for propane is represented by the complete failure of the pressurized propane vessel resulting in the release of 15,300 gallons of propane.

The alternative release scenarios modeled are as follow:\n\n1. Rupture of the 2\" ammonia loading hose.\n2. Failure of ammonia pump seal.\n3.

The alternative scenario that resulted in the largest footprint for anhydrous ammonia release is the rupture of the 2\" ammonia loading hose.  The alternative scenario for propane release is represented by the rupture of the 2\" propane loading hose.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history involves an examination of the effects of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the five years prior to the submission of a risk management program.  The five-year accident history covers:\n\n7 The release of ammonia from Agrium's facility.\n7 The release that caused at least one of the following:\n   1.

The release had not caused any injury except some damages to crops adjacent to the terminal.  The release was investigated and the equipment that failed and caused the release was replaced.
