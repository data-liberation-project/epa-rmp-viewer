      "SummaryText": "THE NIAGARA FALLS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Olin facility, located on Buffalo Avenue in Niagara Falls, NY is part of Olin Corporation. The Niagara Falls Plant has over 100 years of operations.\n\nMaintaining open, positive relationships with the communities is a priority at our plant.  We understand that we are an integral part of the community.  We support the Olin Community Advisory Panel which was formed in the early 1990's and is comprised of community members who represent near neighbors, business, and education.  Quarterly, members gather with plant management to share information on topics of mutual interests.  \n\nMany items we use every day depend on the products manufactured at the Olin Niagara Falls Plant.  Our primary products, chlorine and caustic soda, are used to make everything from paper products, textiles, water treatment, household bleach, pharmaceuticals, vinyl products and household goods.\n\nOlin has a safety and environmental program, which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable.    Our goal is Zero incidents.  To help insure that an emergency situation with off-site implications is unlikely to occur, Olin has put six layers of safety and environmental protection in place: Employees, Mechanical Integrity, Process Hazard Review, Process Controls, Safety Systems, and Emergency Preparedness.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Olin Niagara, we are committed to operating and maintaining our Chlor/Alkali process in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n*  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n*  A five-year accident history for accidental releases"

Chlorine is produced using membrane electrolyzers.  Caustic is produced at 33% strength and is evaporated to 50%.  The chlorine produced is loaded directly into railcars, with minimum on site storage. We do consume chlorine on site in the manufacture of bleach and HCl.  In our process, we use the following chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nChlorine: Chlorine is shipped via railcars to customers.  Chlorine is used on site in the production of HCl and Bleach.\n\nAlso included in the RMP list of Regulated Substances and handled at the Niagara Falls facility, but exempt from the regulation are Hydrogen, and Hydrochloric Acid solutions. In the case of Hydrogen, the volume on site is slightly less than the RMP threshold quantity. This product is shipped by pipeline to near industrial neighbors to be processed into a liquid form.  Hydrochloric Acid solution falls under RMP regulation in concentrations of 37% or greater.  At the Niagara Falls facility, we produce for internal consumption and for sale, HCl.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of this chemical.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

We employ a full time, certified and accredited inspector for inspection and testing.  We also have input from our Area Equipment Integrity Team (AEIT) which meet to discuss equipment issues.\n\nHazard Reviews/PHA's:\nHazard Reviews/PHA's have been conducted on all systems handling hazardous materials, as well as on all new designs prior to operation.  Hazard Reviews identify things that could possibly go wrong so that these situations can be addressed before an incident occurs.\n\nProcess Controls:\nThe plant operations are computer controlled, which provides precise control of processes, maintains tight operating parameters, automates shutdowns, and includes redundant operating stations.\n\nChlorine detectors are installed in process areas, at the plant fence line and also in the community which can identify impending problems, giving operators early warning and enabling them to provide a quick and more effective response. \n\nEmergency Response:\nThe key to minimizing the effect of an accidental release is to get the right people and equipment to the scene quickly, including both on-site and off-site emergency responders.  Olin Niagara maintains our own response team, Olin Corporation Emergency Action Network (OCEAN) and equipment to minimize response time.  We also wo"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at the facility.  During the past five years, we have had no off-site impacting accidental chemical releases as defined by the RMP rule.\n\nIf such an incident should occur, we do conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan, which provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Niagara Falls Fire Department and the Niagara County Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBelow is an example of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases.  Typically we conduct PHA's and implement suggested changes or improvements that are identified in those reviews.  Therefore we don't keep a long list of future changes.  We like to take action so that we minimize the potential of releases.  A recent PHA in our chlorine loading and storage identified these two recommendations:\n\n1) Develop scope and design for an expansion bottle on the East Surge Tank prior to joining the common line to the heaters.\n\n2) Evaluate necessity for modification to C-2 and C-3 interlocks to add tailgas isolation valves off of secondary condenser of the carr"
