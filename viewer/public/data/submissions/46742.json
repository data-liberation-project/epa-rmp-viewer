Introduction\n\nThe Americus Plant is an ammoniated fertilizer production facility that unloads anhydrous ammonia and 44.8% nitrogen solution (25% aqua ammonia) railcars into storage tanks.  The ammonia and ammonia solution are then used in the production of fertilizers.  The facility has been in operation since 1911.\n \nThe Americus Plant has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process.\n\nThe facility safety record is a direct result of much emphasis on safety in the plant on the part of management and employees. \n\nB.    Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\nThe facility is in compliance with OSHA PSM Standards.  Information for P&ID drawings, operations procedures, Management of Change (MOC) documents, and other pertinent documents are on file at the plant office.   The Americus, GA, EHS staff furnishes technical assistance and performs safety and environmental audits and training on a regular basis.\n\nThe ammonia tanks and associated equipment is covered by a mechanical integrity inspection and testing schedule and is constantly monitored. \n\nSafety meetings for all employees are held  at the facility.  In addition, to safety training classes, each employee has taken numerous computer-based safety training courses. All supervisory positions and Hazmat employees are certified in First Aid and CPR.\n\nManagement personnel are actively involved in promoting safety and environmental awareness in the community through participation with the LEPC and coordination with the Fire Department.\n\n\nC.    Emergency Response Policies and Program:\n\nThe  Americus granulation facility employees are trained to be familiar with the Emergency Response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other plant safety meetings.
