Excess CO2 is removed via the amine system, A302dried and then to a HYCO Cold Box for partial oxidation and cryogenic separation and purification of CO.  The Hydrogen from the Cold Box is delivered to the Pressure Swing Adsorption Unit where it is further purified, compressed and sent to the customer.  The CO from the Cold Box is compressed and sent to the customer.  The plant started in 2020 and is subject to 29 CFR1919.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\"Regulated Substances:\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA. The chemical is:\n- Flammable mixture containing hydrogen, methane, and other components, manufactured on site.\n\n\"Accidental Release Prevention Policy:\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.\n\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\"Prevention Program:\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the SSU, Geismar, LA facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of PSI (Process Safety Information), describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the s"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n-Fire extinguishers are located in key areas of the plant. They are maintained monthly and undergo yearly inspections by an outside vendor.\n- Plant operation emergency shutdowns (if process variable is exceeded) will shutdown the Plant and isolate the process.
