IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE  STORAGE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS FOR THE SALE TO FARMERS.  AMMONIA IS RECEIVED , STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANITY STORED WOULD BE 53000 POUNDS IN ONE 12,000 GALLON TANK.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY  HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A SEMI TRAILER HOLDING 41,000 POUNDS.\n     THE WORST CASE SCENERIO WOULD RELEASE 53,000 POUNDS OVER A 10 MINUTE PERIOD.  ACCORDING TO THE DEGADIS MODEL THE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT WOULD BE 1.63 MILES, AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE.\n     THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED AN ANNUAL TRAINING PROGRAM WHERE ALL EMPLOYEES WHO WORK WITH NH3 LEARN SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE MAINTENANCE OF AN NH3 PLANT.  ABOVE ALL THE EMPLOYEES USE GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.\n     THE ANTHONY FARMERS COOP CAN REPORT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO INJURY ACCIDENTS WITHIN THE LAST 5 YEARS.  THIS COMPANY HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN WHICH IS SHARED WITH THE ANTHONY FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THIS PLAN CONTAINS MAPS AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES IN THE EVENT OF A RELEASE OR AN EMMERGENCY.\n     THIS PLANT IS INSPECTED ANNUALLY BY THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN STRICT ADHERANCE WITH ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS."
