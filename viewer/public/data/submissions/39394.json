This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving both practices and measures to prevent the release of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, Henry Fertilizer has an emergency action plan to minimize both on- and off-site effects.\n\nHenry Fertilizer's primary activity is the manufacture of dry, granulated solids containing nitrogen (N), phosphate (P) and potash (K).  Anhydrous ammonia is the one regulated substance at Henry.  Anhydrous ammonia provides the nitrogen (N) source for production of dry, granulated solid NPK fertilizers.\n\nHenry Fertilizer has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The following briefly describes the prevention program elements in place at this stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The facility maintains information describing the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Studies are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with process operations are identified, understood and controlled.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written operating procedures are maintained for covered process operations.  These procedures address the following activities:   initial startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround.\n\nTraining:  A program is in place to ensure employees are knowledgeable and trained in procedures associated with the covered processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity:  Covered process equipment is maintained consistent with generally accepted engineering practices.  Covered process equipment is routinely inspected and tested.  Covered process equipment viability assessments include:  storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance acti"

Deficiencies are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:  Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or procedures.  Affected personnel are informed and trained to deal with authorized system changes.\n\nPre-Startup Review:  Technical and operational reviews are conducted on new processes and/or modifications to existing covered processes.  Reviews confirm the constuction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable.  Reviews are completed prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Internal audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions specified under the RMP rule are being implemented.  At a minimum, these audits are conducted every three (3) years.  Any determined corrective actions are completed in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigations:  Investigations are conducted to determine the root cause of covered process incidents.  In addition to determination and correction, investigations are directed toward preventing reoccurence.  Investigations become process safety information and are retained for five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation:  Henry Fertilizer employees actively contribute in the following:  process hazard assessments, operating procedure development, maintenance procedure development, training development and implementation, pre-startup reviews, incident investigations, and compliance audtis.  Additionally, employees have access to all information pertaining to Henry's RMP.\n\nContractors:  Periodically, Henry Fertilizer hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to work, contractors are trained on the covered processes, relevant process safety information and emergency response actions.\n\nFive (5) Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that have resulted in dea"

This plan includes notification of the Marshall County LEPC and the Illinois Emergency Management agency.  Both state and local authorities have been provided with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required by SARA Title III.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  Henry Fertilizer views safety improvement as a continual process.  Periodic evaluations (both internal and external) are performed to assess the facility status.  At this time, and aside from maintenance activities, there are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding anhydrous ammonia."
