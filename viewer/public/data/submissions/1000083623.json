      "SummaryText": "In the preceding RMP, an evaluation of the catastrophic loss an the more probable alternatives were evaluated using the RMP software provided by EPA/  Brainerd Chemical of North Carolina LLC has two chemicals on site that has exceeded the threshold limits for RMP.  These chemicals are Formaldehyde and Hydrofluoric Acid.  It is expected that the worst case scenario for Formaldehyde would be a catastrophic event resulting in the total release of the product from the bulk storage tank, followed by its complete vaporization to form a toxic vapor cloud.  The more probable cause for release would be a ruptured line or hose during repackaging operations  that would result in the loss of the contents of the tank into the building.  It is believed that this incident would be cleaned up before all of the spill could be vaporized and leave site.  The worst case scenario for Hydrofluoric Acid is the complete loss of the bulk storage tanks.  The contents would be contained within the building.  The more likely scenario would likely happen as a result of line failure during the filling of a tank.  The building would completely contain any spill that occurred inside the building.  The only way that formaldehyde would be exposed to the outside environment would be if they were spilled during the offloading process through the outside loading rack.  Even that is contained within a secondary containment unit."
