Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 84,118  pounds in the facility's tank.  \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The mazimum quantity released would be 84,118, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model on the model used is .94 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose, with 26,638 pounds release over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .78 miles.\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling ofAnhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, nor to our knowledg"
