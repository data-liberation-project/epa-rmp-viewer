Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia for controlling NOx emissions. \n\nBerry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia injection system.  Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 is located in Los Angeles County, California, approximately two miles from city of Newhall. The facility is adjacent to the antelope Valley Freeway and is within the recently incorporated city limits of Santa Clarita.  The site occupies 3.1 acres. It is located on a leveled pad with a barrier (hill) between the facility and the freeway. The site is adjacent to the Berry Petroleum Company production and also has sparsely located oil wells around the site. \n\nBerry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 is owned by Berry Petroleum Company and it was purchased in January 1999 from Arco Western Energy.  Steam and electricity are produced and sold to the local power utility company. There are two General Electrical LM2500 turbine generators, each producing 21.5 MW of power.  The cogeneration system electrical power output runs in parallel with the local utility company grid."

All steam produced is delivered to the Berry Petroleum Company for injection into the oil formation from enhanced oil recovery.\nThe site is currently operated by Solar Assets Management Services and is manned 24 hrs a day. There are five personnel assigned.\n\nThe regulated substance manage at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum intended inventory is 55,575 lbs of anhydrous ammonia and is stored in a pressurized horizontal storage tank at ambient temperature in liquid form.  When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a vaporizer is utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor. The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixing chamber where it is mixed with air. The resulting vapor ammonia / air stream is then injected into the HRSG. This, in conjunction with the catalyst within the HRSG, allow for the reduction of NOx and other unwanted materials being sent to the environment. The exhaust gas containing a lower concentration of NOx is then sent from the HRSG to an exhaust stack. \n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the ammonia injection system.
