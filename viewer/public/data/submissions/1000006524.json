      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention\nBerry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 has developed a Risk Management Program to address the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements (40 CFR Part 68).  Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia for controlling NOx emissions. \n\nBerry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia injection system.  Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 is located in Los Angeles County, California, approximately two miles from city of Newhall. The facility is adjacent to the antelope Valley Freeway and is within the recently incorporated city limits of Santa Clarita.  The site occupies 3.1 acres. It is located on a leveled pad with a barrier (hill) between the facility and the freeway. The site is adjacent to the Berry Petroleum Company production and also has sparsely located oil wells around the site. \n\nBerry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 is owned by Berry Petroleum Company and it was purchased in January 1999 from Arco Western Energy.  Steam and electricity are produced and sold to the local power utility company. There are two General Electrical LM2500 turbine generators, each producing 21.5 MW of power.  The cogeneration system electrical power output runs in parallel with the local utility company grid."

Exhaust heat from the gas turbines is recovered in the heat recovery steam Generation system. All steam produced is delivered to the Berry Petroleum Company for injection into the oil formation from enhanced oil recovery.\nThe site is currently operated by Solar Assets Management Services and is manned 24 hrs a day. There are five personnel assigned.\n\nThe regulated substance manage at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum intended inventory is 55,575 lbs of anhydrous ammonia and is stored in a pressurized horizontal storage tank at ambient temperature in liquid form.  When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a vaporizer is utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor. The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixing chamber where it is mixed with air. The resulting vapor ammonia / air stream is then injected into the HRSG. This, in conjunction with the catalyst within the HRSG, allow for the reduction of NOx and other unwanted materials being sent to the environment. The exhaust gas containing a lower concentration of NOx is then sent from the HRSG to an exhaust stack. \n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the ammonia injection system.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Tab 2 of the CalARP/RMP Submittal Binder.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Two alternative release scenarios were modeled. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Tab 2 of the CalARP/RMP Submittal Binder.\n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can po"

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\nA?Automatic / Manual Shutdown\nA?Ammonia sensors in the process area\nA?Automatic Deluge System\nA?Well Designed Relief System\n\nThe history of the Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 (i.e., no RMP-applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Injection System.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAs part of the implementation of this RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Berry Petroleum Cogeneration Facility 42 to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for the NOx abatement system.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facilityA?s maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 55,575 lbs.
