This document has been prepared to satisfy multiple regulations and is governed by the following agencies:\n\n\u0095\tFederal EPA's, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3 requirements (RMP).\n\n\u0095\tOSHA\u0092s Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Section 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM).\n\nThe purpose of this document is to:\n\n\u0095\tIncrease the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\n\n\u0095\tAssist Bongards\u0092 Creameries and local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling regulated substances.\n\nThis document addresses Bongards\u0092 Creameries administrative and operational programs to prevent accidents related to regulated substances and to reduce potential risks. The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia. The facility utilizes an ammonia system to provide refrigeration for the processing and storage of dairy products.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nBongards\u0092 Creameries is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility.\n\nBongards\u0092 Creameries senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety an"

Bongards\u0092 Creameries safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the EHS Manager, Plant Manager, and Refrigeration Operator who conduct inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nBongards' Creameries is located Norwood Young America Minnesota. A 196 acre site with industrial activity / processing activity occupying approximately 3.04 acres.  Industrial activities include the manufacture and processing of natural, processed and analog cheese.  Warehouses are on site for the storage of the cheese and ingredients.\n\nRefrigeration is necessary for the manufacture, processing and storage of dairy products. The facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 11,816 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid). Typical operating conditions range from 15 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 130-180 psig on the high side.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Bongards\u0092 Creameries ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. The facility staff conducts preventative maintenance and necessary repairs in house. An outside contractor is hired for repairs, maintenance or inspections as needed.\n\nThe facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia ref"

In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room. All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are piped to several common headers and relieve to atmosphere (outside). \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the past 5 years there has been no releases that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nBongards\u0092 Creameries has an emergency action plan in effect. The Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n1.)\tTo save lives.\n2.)\tTo minimize and avoid injuries. \n3.)\tTo protect the environment.\n4.)\tTo minimize property damage.\n\nThis Plan provides the action response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed at least once per year.\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility\u0092s action plan to respond to the situation. If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.  Bongards\u0092 Creameries maintains a safety committee.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis revalidation was conducted, in conjunction with a professional ammonia refrigeration engineering contractor, in July of 2020. Recommendations resulting from the revalidation were promptly addressed. Bongards\u0092 Creameries wil"
