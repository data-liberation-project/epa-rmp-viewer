It is our policy at Locklin's Bottled Gas to provide propane to our customers in the safest possible manner.  We ensure safety to our staff, customers and community by having safety devices on our stationary and portable tanks and practicing safe handling procedures.  Our staff are well trained and experienced propane handlers.\n\nOur emergency response program consists of emergency action guides for our staff and the local fire department; notification procedures; first-aid and medical treatment information; and staff training.  The emergency action guides are based upon the safe response procedure recommendations from the National Propane Gas Association [NPGA] Safety Bulletins and the 1998 North American Field Response Guidebook.  Our notification procedures are in place to inform the Hamlin Fire Department and immediate neighbors if there is a release.\n\n2.  About Propane and our Bulk Storage Facility:\n\nOur facility in a business district area of Hamlin, Wayne County, Pennsylvania.  We provide propane retail sales service to our local community and other parts of Wayne County. The propane is used by our customers as a fuel.  We have no customers who have more than 10,000 pounds at one time.  We receive propane by truck transports and store it in two connected 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum intended inventory of propane on site in the bulk tanks and other small cylinder is 221,800 pounds.  Propane is delivered to customers by bobtail trucks and service trucks.  Our facility has two loading and unloading stations and a DOT cylinder filling station.  This area is restricted to authorized personnel only by a six foot high heavy-duty fence.  There is ample open space surrounding our free tanks and is kept clean and clear.  Our staff performs all filling and delivery operations.\n\n3.  Off-site Consequence Ana"

      "SummaryText": "lysis:\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the bulk tank when filled to 80% would release 110,000 pounds of propane or less.  Our policy limits the maximum filling capacity to 80% at 60 degrees F. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor and finds an ignition source.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for the worst-case scenario is 0.4 mile.  This distance extends beyond the boundaries of our facility and encompasses numerous residences, several businesses, three churches and several roads.\n\nAlternative Scenario - A hose rupture caused by a pull away when the driver of the bobtail or transport fails to disconnect the hoses before driving away.  A 4\" 25 feet liquid hose would release 69 pounds of propane.  If the vapor finds and ignition source and ignited, it would affect an area  0.03 mile radius from the tank.  The distance extends beyond the boundaries of our facility and encompasses several residences,  businesses,  roads and one church.\n\n4.  Prevention Program:\n\nOur facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with NFPA -58.  Our bulk storage tank and equipment was designed and constructed according to National Fire Protection Association [NFPA] code 58 and  is well maintained.  Our staff are trained on safe handling and emergency procedures.  Our safety information, operating procedures, training, and maintenance inspections are up-to-date.\n\n5. Accident History:\n\nWe have never had an accident at our facility.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:\n\nOur emergency response program consists of emergency action guides for our staff and the local fire department; notification procedures; first-aid and medical treatment information; and staff training.  The emergency action guides are based upon the safe response procedure recommendations from the National Propane Gas Association [NPGA] Safety Bulletins and the 1998 North American Field Response Guidebook.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nWe are evaluating the recommendations from the hazards review and will implement our decisions by June 21, 1999.  Key upgrades include  tank and line remarking, re-securing loose pipe fasteners and hydrostatic pressure relief valve upgrades.  This summer, we plan on having a facility tour and emergency procedures demonstration for the Hamlin Fire Department."
