Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are generally adhered to.  Energy Transfer's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Response Program requirements.\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer's spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED (40 CFR 68.155 (B))\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at Energy Transfer's Lefors Gas Plant Facility, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, is the handling and compression of natural gas.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold to a petroleum refiner.  The flammable regulated chemical mixture at the Facility is Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane and N-pentane.  These flammable chemicals have a regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  \r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS (40 CFR 68.155 (D))\r\n\r\nThe Facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR 68.  This Facility was designed"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the stationary source.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION AND PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer maintains process safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the facility.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained in the RMP at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe facility conducts safety inspections and hazard analyses to identify and control the hazards associated with the process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (40 CFR 68.155 (E))\r\n\r\nThe Facility has not had a reportable accident of covered processes in the five years previous to September 1, 2011, the renewal date of the RMP plan.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (40 CFR 68.155 (F))\r\n\r\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Program that is called their Emergency Response Plan.  The emergency Response Plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of a regulated substance accidental release.  Aspects of emergency response include adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  In the event of a covered process accident, first aid procedures, and procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually.  A site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on the site are kept at the Facility.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (40 CFR 68.155 (G))\r\n\r\nMaintenance"
