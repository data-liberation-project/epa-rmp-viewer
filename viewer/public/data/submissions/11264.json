One component\r\nof  this  system  is a risk management program (RMP)  that  helps\r\nmanage  the  risks at CFS and that complies with the requirements\r\nof  the  Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation  40\r\nCFR  part  68,  Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk\r\nManagement Programs (the RMP rule).\r\n\r\nOne  of  the  requirements of the RMP rule is to  submit  a  risk\r\nmanagement  plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management  program\r\nat  CFS.   This  document  is  intended  to  satisfy  the  RMPlan\r\nrequirement  of  the RMP rule and to provide the  public  with  a\r\ndescription of the risk management program at CFS.\r\n\r\nThe RM program at CFS consists of three (3) elements:\r\n1)   A hazard assessment to help understand:\r\n               The potential offsite consequences of hypothetical\r\n               accidental releases and;\r\n               accidents that have occurred during the last  five\r\n               (5)  years  associated with the use of  substances\r\n               regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\r\n2)   A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the\r\n     processes  containing more than a threshold  quantity  of  a\r\n     regulated substance (covered processes).\r\n3)   An  emergency response"
