Bayway Chemical Plant\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Infineum USA L.P.Bayway Chemical Plant has had a long-\r\nstanding commitment to protecting their employees, the public,\r\nand the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the\r\nresources invested in accident prevention such as: providing\r\ncomprehensive initial and refresher personnel training,\r\nconsidering safety in the design, installation, operation,\r\ninspection, and maintenance of our processes, and conducting\r\ndrills to respond to simulated emergencies. Our objective is to\r\nimplement controls to minimize the potential for releases.\r\nHowever, if a release occurs, our trained personnel will respond\r\nto control, contain, and mitigate the leak.\r\n\r\nWe prevent accidents using a structured safety management system\r\nentitled OIMPS, Operations Integrity Management PracticeS, and a\r\nTotal Safety Culture in which all employees play a role in the\r\nprevention of incidents. Our Operations Integrity Management\r\nSystems are the cornerstone for continuous improvement in our\r\nsafety-related systems.  These systems are evergreen and are in a\r\ncontinuous state of improvement, usually through many small\r\nimprovement steps.  Some examples are the recommendations from\r\nour hazard reviews and any incident investigations.\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Chemical Plant has been recognized by the Occupational\r\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a VPP STAR Facility\r\n(Voluntary Protection Program - Safety Through Accountability and\r\nRecognition) for its effective safety and health management\r\nprograms. Our plant has also mentored four other Linden\r\nbusinesses in achieving this select status.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Infineum Bayway Chemical Plant, located in Linden, N.

Our flammable materials are:\r\nmixed butane and butenes, and mixed propane, propylene and\r\nhexane. Our regulated toxic materials are: ammonia, chlorine,\r\nhydrogen chloride, and vinyl acetate. In addition we have\r\nhydrogen sulfide that is a regulated substance under the New\r\nJersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe plant uses a structured Operations Integrity Management\r\nSystem (OIMS), which cover all aspects of our operations that\r\ncould affect the safety or health of our employees or public\r\nneighbors. This system was developed by Exxon Chemical Company in\r\n1992. Although the plant became part of a new company, Infineum,\r\nin 1999, OIMS continues to be the formal Operations integrity\r\nProgram at the Bayway Chemical Plant. In 2006, Lloyd's Register\r\nQuality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the\r\ninternational standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO\r\n14001). After an extensive review, Lloyd's concluded that the\r\nenvironmental management components of Infineum's OIMS have\r\naddressed all requirements of ISO 14001:2004, and that these\r\nrequirements are effectively implemented throughout the\r\norginazation at the Bayway Chemical Plant.\r\n\r\nThe OIMP system meets all the requirements of OSHA Process Safety\r\nManagement, The EPA Risk Management Program, and the New Jersey\r\nToxic Catastrophe Prevention Act. The system also exceeds all\r\nregulatory requirements by incorporating periodic management\r\nreview of performance measurements for each practice to evaluate\r\nwhether each practice is working as planned and what improvements\r\nmight be made. Our plant has received OSHA VPP STAR status in\r\n1994. The plant was re-certified in 2002.
