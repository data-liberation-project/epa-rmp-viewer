      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Stop & Shop Supermarket Company LLC began operations of the new Distribution Facility in Freetown, Massachusetts in 2004.  The Freetown Distribution Facility is a refrigerated facility utilized by Stop & Shop for the storage and distribution of products to over 240 stores.  Since many of these products must remain refrigerated, Stop & Shop operates a refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is identified as a toxic gas in the EPA regulation ?Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program? or ?RMP?.\n\nRefrigeration systems that use anhydrous ammonia are an established and recognized technology and have been in use for decades.  EPA recognizes that ammonia refrigeration plants are very different from complex chemical processing operations.  The complex level of operations involved in chemical processing plants are not found in refrigerated facilities where there are no chemical reactions.  While there are new developments leading to more efficient operations, the design principals are fully available.  A complete understanding of the safe design and operating guidelines has been available to design and operating practitioners in the industry for some time.  As is common for most commercial systems, the Stop & Shop refrigeration system operates in a sequential mode based on the heat load.  The heat load is based upon the material being moved into the warehouse and by outside air temperatures.  As such, the process control parameters of greatest consequences are the temperature and pressure readings throughout the system.\n\nAs part of the RMP, Stop & Shop has conducted analyses of two ammonia release scenarios, the ?worst case? scenario and the ?alternative release? scenario.  Following EPA guidance, the worst case release was defined as the largest ammonia containing vessel , specifically the high pressure receiver with a maximum inventory of 4300 pounds.  The worst case release scenar"

      "SummaryText": "io further assumed that all the mechanical controls and all active safety systems failed to operate.  The area affected by the worst case release was determined using the EPA?s own Offsite Consequences Analysis dispersion model RMP Comp.  Under the hypothetical scenario, ammonia vapor would travel past the boundary of the facility as it dispersed with air, reaching approximately 0.8 miles from the point of release.  Although the probability of such a release is extremely remote, an estimated population of 368 could potentially be impacted by such a release.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is defined to be a more plausible case than the worst case scenario, and is useful as a planning case for the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and other emergency responders.  The approach for selecting the alternative release involved an examination of three sources: \n1) the Process Hazards Analysis conducted on the system, 2) past (non-reportable minor) release events at the Stop & Shop distribution facility and, 3) the industry specific Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration guidance document, sponsored by the EPA.  The scenario selected was a motor pump failure for a pump in the machine room and was based on a very minor similar release that did occur at the Freetown Facility.  Hypothetically, if a pump failed completely in the machine room, the following sequence of events would be triggered:\n1.    At 250 ppm, the ammonia detector would stop all compressors\n2.    All pumps would shut down\n3.    An alarm would sound in the maintenance shop and guard station\n4.    A guard would notify a maintenance mechanic\n5.    Even if there were no attempt to isolate the leak or if all the mechanical controls and all active safety \nsystems failed to operate, approximately 1700 to 2800 pounds of ammonia would potentially be released. \nFor the alternative release scenario, it is assumed that 2800 pounds of ammonia would be released over a period of 10 minutes.

In accordance with that standard, a comprehensive program has been implemented which addresses process hazards analysis, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, emergency preparedness and other process safety-related topics.\n\nThe RMP requires that we report a five-year history for accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuation or shelter in place of the community, or environmental damage.  Since this facility opened in 2004, no such releases have occurred.  Many efforts have been made to reduce the potential risks associated with the refrigeration system.  Should a significant ammonia release occur, the facility?s Emergency Response Plan would be activated.  The Emergency Response Plan has been developed to define what actions Stop & Shop associates are to take in the event of an ammonia release, and to identify those actions to be performed by the Fire Department and emergency response contractors.\n\nStop & Shop maintenance department employees act as primary responders only in environments containing less than 300 parts per million (ppm).  For releases exceeding this level, the Freetown Fire Department would be notified along with designated emergency response contractors.  The building would be evacuated as appropriate and the maintenance department employees would provide secondary assistance to the responders, as needed.  The Freetown Fire Department would act as the incident commanders and will initiate any public notification, if deemed necessary.\n\nThe Stop & Shop Freetown Distribution Facility is dedicated to maintaining a safe operation.  We support and work closely with our employees and contractors, the LEPC and local response organizations to prevent accidental releases, and to be prepared if they ever should occur."
