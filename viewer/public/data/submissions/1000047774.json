      "SummaryText": "Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc.  (AECI's)  New Madrid Power Plant, consisting of two coal fired 600-MW electric generation units, has installed two selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units to reduce NOx emissions.  These systems require approximately 3600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per hour each day per unit; 7200 pounds per hour each day for the facility.  Onsite storage of anhydrous ammonia will not exceed 1.35 mil. pounds stored in four each, 80,000 gallon tanks. NMPP has six NH3 storage tanks; however, only four tanks are in service at time.  The remaining two tanks are kept empty to standby and contain only vapor pressure.\r\n\r\nThe RMP relies on the facility Process Safety Management (PSM) program for the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes employee training in operations, maintenance and emergency response procedures.  The facility maintains an on-site Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is trained and refreshed annually to the HAZ-MAT Technician Level.  The facility is also involved with the Bootheel LEPC.  The on-site ERT is trained and equipped to be able to respond in Level A chemical HAZ-MAT suits with SCBA for emergency response in the event of an anhydrous ammonia release. \r\n\r\nNew Madrid Power Plant is in compliance with the PSM and RMP programs.  Prevention and emergency \r\nresponse procedures are in place to prevent or mitigate the potential for anhydrous ammonia releases. Passive and active mitigation systems are in place as well.  Employees are involved in the What if/Checklist analysis process. \r\n\r\nThe New Madrid Power Plant RMP was deactivated Sept. 13, 2013.  After deactivation, all associated piping, tanks, and vessels were re-certified and placed under a Nitrogen blanket for corrosion protection.  In November 2014, the PSM program was revised and updated-and a new Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted in anticipation of a planned system startup in January 2015. Additionally, the last compliance audit was performed in"
