Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Othello facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\n-  Fire Plan\n-  Ammonia Leak Procedures\n-  Evacuation Procedures\n-  Responsibilities of the Emergency Response Team\n\nG.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChanges were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the ammonia refrigeration system was analyzed in 1998.  The recommended changes have been evaluated and will be implemented as required."

Simplot Co. to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  Simplot will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The Unit Director has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  Simplot takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These  precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe sonditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems.  A training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which anable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Boiler and Refrigeration Supervisor is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSimplot's Othello facility produces frozen potato products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the food products and the production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 87,600 pounds.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Othello facility.\n\nC.  Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario at the Othello facility involves the release of 24,300 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of an ammonia receiver.  This maximum inventory reflects the"

Under worst-case conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site impacts.\n\nThe alternative toxic release scenario at the Othello facility involves the release of 11,037 pounds of ammonia over a 13 minute period due to a release from a pressure relief valve.  The release duration was assumed to be limited by the time it would take to empty the ammonia receiver under normal operating conditions.  Under alternative release conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site impacts.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative toxic release scenarios are unlilkely for the following reasons:\n\n-  The weather conditions that were used for the worst-case release scenario do not occur, while those used for the alternative case are uncommon;\n-  Industry standards are followed for the design and manufacture of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system;\n-  The ammonia receivers are well protected from vehicular traffic;\n-  Pressure safety valves on the ammonia receivers should limit any pressure increases inside the receivers;\n-  Ammonia detectors should readily detect releases from the pressure relief valves on the ammonia receivers;\n-  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n-  The facility has a preventative maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the ammonia refrigeration equipment;\n-  The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel;\n-  The facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases.\n\nD.
