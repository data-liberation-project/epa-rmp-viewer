The prevention of occupationally induced injury or illness is of such consequence that it is given precedence over productivity whenever necessary.  Safety is every employee's job.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nFomo Products, Inc. fills containers with an isocyanate and a polyol (resin) initiator blend along with various propellant materials, thereby creating aerosol containers that, when discharged, provide a polyurethane foam that polymerizes into a solid shortly after exposure to ambient air and moisture.  The propellant for many of the containers is either (1) 1,1-difluoroethane or (2) a mixture of dimethyl ether, isobutane, and propane.  These propellants are stored as liquids under pressure in two separate storage tanks outside the Fomo Products plant.  The nominal volume of the 1,1-difluoroethane tank is approximately 11,000 gallons and that of the dimethyl ether/isobutane/propane tank is approximately 18,000 gallons.  The propellant materials are delivered to "

      "SummaryText": "a specially designed, fire-safe gas house via hard piping.  Inside this gas house, the propellants are dispensed into the various containers via an automated gas dispensing system.  The bulk storage tanks will never be filled to more than 85% of their respective nominal volumes.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case release scenario analyzed was a release of the entire contents of the dimethyl ether/isobutane/propane tank followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The impact was evaluated by calculating the distance to an overpressure of one pound per square inch using the TNT-equivalency method.  The analysis showed that the distance to a 1 psi overpressure would be 0.42 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered is one in which a pressure relief valve that serves each of the bulk storage tanks fails, thereby creating a flammable vapor cloud.  The criteria for this evaluation was the lower flammability limit (LFL).  Using the methodology (for a flammable, dense gas) for estimating the distance to LFL outlined by U.S.EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (look-up tables), the distance to the LFL for a release from either tank would be less than 0.06 miles.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe primary hazard associated with handling of the flammable gases is a release of flammable gases at the point at which the gases are dispensed into containers.  To mitigate this hazard, Fomo Products has installed a specially designed gas house.  This gas house includes flammable material (hydrocarbon) analyzers which would stop the flow of gas to the gas house if the concentration exceeds a set point less than the lower flammability limit.  In addition, the gas house includes an automated fire suppression system and a deflagration panel that would vent the deflagration away from the employees and the plant in the event of an explosion.\n\nIn addition to the gas house, Fomo Products has installed hydrocarbon analyzers near each bulk storage "

Fomo Products also provides safety training to employees and conducts routine safety audits of facility equipment and procedures.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nFomo Products has not had any reportable accidents (i.e., fires, explosions, etc.) involving the regulated chemicals in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nFomo Products has developed a detailed emergency response plan that stipulates persons who will perform key procedures including, but not limited to, (1) evacuation of the building (including a set meeting point), (2) notifying the local fire department, (3) emergency first aid and health care procedures, (4) transportation of injured persons to a health care facility, and (5) notification of neighboring residents/businesses.\n\nPLANNED SAFETY CHANGES\n\nIn the near future, the Norton, Ohio Fire Department will use Fomo Products as a training facility for its firefighters.  This will allow the fire department to enhance its skills in emergency response and will also make the fire department more familiar with the Fomo Products site and its operations.  In addition, Fomo Products will soon be installing a \"Knox Box\" on the outside of the plant building.  This box will contain keys to the facility, a facility map, and material safety data sheets identifying contents of system storage tanks that could be used by the fire responders should an emergency occur."
