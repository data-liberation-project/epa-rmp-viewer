The Emergency Plan addresses emergencies arising from fires, chemical releases, uncontrolled releases of flammable gases, bomb threats, civil disorders, and natural disasters such as hurricanes , floods and high winds. All employees are trained on how and to whom to report emergencies and proper evacuation procedures. Certain, qualified employees, have the additional responsibility of responding to an emergency. These emergency coordinators receive training to be familiar with and knowledgeable of emergency response procedures. In the event of any major release of hazardous material, the emergency coordinator and the North Charleston Fire Department are immediately notified, and all Airgas National Welders personnel are evacuated to a predetermined evacuation meeting point. Accidental releases of chemicals are reported and addressed according to the incident investigation procedures found in the Safety and AERO Emergency Response Manuals.\n\n\n\nThis RMP covers the receipt, storage and distribution of chlorine in 150 lb. cylinders.The chlorine is purchased from an independent vendor, transported to the North Charleston facility via an Airgas National W"
