      "SummaryText": "Helix Water District owns and operates the R.M. Levy Water Treatment Plant.  This facility disinfects and provides drinking water to more than 250,000 people in a 50 square mile area.  This facility was upgraded at a cost of more than $45,000,000 in 1999 to meet more stringent water treatment and chemical handling requirements.  The only regulated chemical used on-site is chlorine.  A total of 48,000 pounds of chlorine is stored in a storage room that is equipped with a scrubber system, leak detection sensors and alarms, and new process control and safety equipment.  A diesel-powered emergency generator provides power to all safety systems during power outages.  R.M. Levy Water Treatment Plant has never experienced an off-site chlorine release in 40 years of operation.  Treatment plant employees participate in emergency drills and training and facilities are continually maintained and upgraded to provide safe operation to protect the public and environment."
