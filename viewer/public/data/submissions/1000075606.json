This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event that such a release does occur we are completely coordinated with the Caldwell County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Granite Falls Fire Department to provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects.\r\n\r\n2.THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of polyethylene foam products that are used as packaging material.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility, a blend of isobutane.  This regulated substance is used as a blowing agent at our facility.  \r\n\r\n3. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, we have one process at our facility which is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and we operate under a Title V permit.

Because Pregis's stringent release prevention programs, there have been no significant accidental releases during this period.\r\n\r\n5.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nPregis maintains a written emergency evacuation plan for the safety of its employees during accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies.  Pregis employees do not respond to the emergency. \r\n\r\nEmergency notification equipment is regularly inspected and serviced to insure proper functioning.  Upon modification of the covered process, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes within the covered process that would require a modified emergency response.  \r\n\r\n6.PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nTo enhance our continuous improvement in occupational safety and health, we conduct monthly general safety planning meetings which includes employee participation."
