This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for our employees as well as our neighbors and environment.  Our delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained in regard to chlorine hazards and emergency response.  Our employees watch the delivery of each truck bringing chlorine to our site.  In addition, we contract out to chlorine system professionals to periodically inspect our chlorine system, and make any necessary adjustments to either equipment or procedures to continue to ensure safe handling and use of chlorine.\r\n\r\n4. Five-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases, injuries, or environmental damage resulting from our chlorine system for at least the last ten years.\r\n\r\n5. The emergency response program:\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the management system we have in place and the appropriate discovery and notification procedures to ensure coordination with our local emergency responders.  We have discussed this program with the Ogden Fire Department.  A representative of the Ogden Fire Department visits the plant every year.   Our insurance company visits our facility annually. \r\n\r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\r\nThe following recommendations were made in the January 23, 2009 PHA revalidation, and will be implemented by December 31, 2009:\r\n\r\n*Put bug screen on relief valve discharge-(COMPLETED)\r\n*Supply secured wheel chock or dock lock \r\n*Document relief valve design conditions- (COMPLETED) \r\n*Consider including LO/TO procedures for BV-1 and BV-2 into cylinder changeout SOP. \r\n*Update the P&ID to show the interlocks\r\n*Consider interlocking the chlorine sensor to shutdown the heater upon detection of the leakage in the Chlorine room\r\n*In order to eliminate the crossing of RR tracks, d"

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nIn our Horizon Milling, LLC, Ogden, Utah facility, we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by United States Environmental Protection Agency.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as in our milling process also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response procedures include notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  Our chlorine system is enclosed within our building to help keep it secure.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to convert wheat into flour.  Chlorine is used in our process to whiten the flour and provide special baking properties that our clients like for the breads, muffins, cakes, etc. they make.  Chlorine is received by truck (transports) and is stored inside our flour mill.  The storage capacity of each cylinder vessel is 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  We have a total capacity for four cylinders; therefore the maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at our plant is approximately 8,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThis facility c"
