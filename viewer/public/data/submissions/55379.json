      "SummaryText": "The Cedar Rapids Water Pollution Control Facilities (CRWPCF) is located on approximately 40 acres in the southeastern quadrant of Cedar Rapids and currently serves the cities of Cedar Rapids, Marion, Hiawatha, and Robins. The plant became operational in 1980 and offers treatment of up to 56 million gallons of wastewater per day.  Advanced biological treatment provides processing of industrial and domestic waste.  Administration, Operations, Maintenance and Warehouse buildings provide the support and control functions for the wastewater treatment and solids handling facilities.\n\nCRWPCF is designed and operated to maintain discharge compliance with the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. 1342(b)].  Federal and state requirements are defined in a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, which allows the City to operate the plant and to discharge treated effluent to the Cedar River.  The NPDES permit establishes daily maximum and monthly average effluent limitations for the plant.  \n\nThe plant conducts continuous chlorination and dechlorination of the wastewater going to the Cedar River between April 1 and October 31 as required by the NPDES Permit issued by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.   Chlorination of the wastewater is conducted by injecting and dissolving chlorine gas directly into the effluent.  This process is necessary to kill potentially harmful bacteria that may be present in wastewater.  Chlorine is removed from the effluent with the addition of magnesium bisulfite to reduce potential impacts on aquatic organisms.  All chlorine and magnesium bisulfite is stored and processed in the Disinfection Building. \n\nThe Disinfection Building includes a chlorine container room, a magnesium bisulfite (MBS) room, chlorination room, and a sample room.  Four one-ton containers are on-line at any one time with an additional four ton-containers on standby.  The Disinfection Building is normally unmanned but operators visit the facility daily and resp"

      "SummaryText": "ond to any trouble alarms that may occur.\n\nNationwide, accidents reported to EPA involving chlorine systems have been caused by rust holes, failure of a diaphragm, leaks during hookup to a tank, a packing nut leak, faulty cylinders, removal of a valve in error, faulty valves, leaking gaskets, and a blown pressure gauge.  Each of these incidents, while potentially serious, can be easily controlled through maintenance or process system safety features that would prevent a catastrophic release.  Chlorine is historically the preferred disinfecting agent for water, having been first introduced to the United States for water treatment in 1908.\n\nThe Water Pollution Control Facilities accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:  (1) high level of training of the operators, (2) preventive maintenance program which includes an annual operations and maintenance pre-startup safety review, (3) use of process and safety equipment, (4) use of accurate and effective operating procedures,  (5)  performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures, and (6)  implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the availability of respiratory protection devices [a supplied air respirator (SAR) is worn by mechanics during the connection / disconnection of chlorine ton-containers and a self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is available for emergency use], awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors throughout the Disinfection Building.  No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the WPCF in the past five years.\n\nThe WPCF has an emergency response program that has been coordinated with the Cedar Rapids Fire Department (CRFD).  The CRFD has a professional, well-trained and well-equipped Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response Team and the CRFD is a member of the Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

A Chlorine Institute Emergency ?B? Kit, which includes the necessary tools and equipment for repairing ton container leaks, is available on-site for use by the HAZMAT Team. The CRFD also has an agreement for mutual aid and assistance with the City of Marion Fire Department."
