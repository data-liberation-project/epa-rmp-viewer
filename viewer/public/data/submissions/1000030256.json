      "SummaryText": "Introduction\r\n\r\nThe DuPont corporation is a member of the American Chemistry Council and receives external certification of its Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) consistent with those requirements. The DuPont Washington Works site adheres to Corporate Safety Health and Environmental (SHE) policies which are a part of that program.  For safety and environmental incidents, these policies can be summarized as follows;\r\n\r\n  -We believe all safety and environmental incidents are preventable.\r\n  -Our goal for incidents is zero.\r\n  -We are prepared for emergencies and we will provide leadership for our local communities to \r\n    help in their emergency preparedness.\r\n\r\nCorporate Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) & RCMS policies are embodied in numerous site SHE procedures along with guidelines and recommended practices in DuPont Engineering Standards. Corporate SHE policies and Washington Works SHE procedures are available for review by all employees.\r\n\r\nAt Washington Works, SHE policies and procedures are also documented in the Washington Works SHE Manual.  Various procedures throughout the manual deal specifically with Process Safety Management elements to prevent incidents from occurring.  It is the responsibility of every employee and contractor working on our behalf to comply with these procedures.  It is management's responsibility to educate and train employees so they may understand and comply with the procedures. \r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe DuPont Washington Works main plant site consists of approximately 450 acres located approximately five miles west of Parkersburg, WV.  Manufacturing operations are located on approximately 170 of the 450 acres.  Polymer resins and products in primary forms are manufactured at the site.  In addition to manufacturing operations and associated support facilities, the site also has areas dedicated to wildlife habitat and a local historic landmark that the site leases to the state for use by the public.  \r\n\r\nThe sit"
