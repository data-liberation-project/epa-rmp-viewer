This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Energy Transfer policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nRanch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant uses cryogenic fractionation to separate ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from raw wellhead gas to produce marketable natural gas.  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances (methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane and n-pentane) are processed, recovered and stored at the facility.  The Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant has had no accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nLocal Emergency Response Coordination\r\nThe Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant has coordinated its emergency reponse activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68,12(b)(3).\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant.  Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nEnergy Transfer and the Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant actively encourages all levels of employees and contract employees to partici"

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nEnergy Transfer is committed to operating the Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant in a safe manner for workers, the public, and the environment.  Energy Transfer personnel utilize auditing processes to ensure the plant complies with safe operations of its processes.  In the event improvements in safety can be realized through auditing efforts, actions are planned and instituted to respond to safety enhancements of operating practices.  Improvements to safety are a continual process at the plant."

Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses the physical properties of hazardous substances handled, operating parameters of the equipment, and design basis and configuration of the equipment.  Energy Transfer ensures that this process safety information is available to all Energy Transfer employees, the LEPC, and the fire department.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any know hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limited maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure tht safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nThe Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identifi"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completiong dates.  The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Ranch Westex JV LLC Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.
