Currently Cessco\n\nemployees five (5) people including management and owners.  When Cessco relocated its plant \n\nfacilities in 1991, it sought an isolated location.  In determining the propellant tank location sites, \n\nthe tanks were placed at the furthest possible distance from homes or offices.  Being a small, \n\nclose knit company, management makes every effort to provide a safe working environment.  \n\nMonthly safety meetings are held and management and plant personnel interact equally.  Every \n\nemployee has received and been certified in Hazardous Materials HM0181F/126F Training.  \n\nLast training and certification was completed on November 17,2015 on site by trainer William Jernigan.  \n\nCessco also receives regular courtesy visits from the St. Johns Fire Department as the \n\nfire department periodically uses Cessco's plant and grounds for the training of their new \n\nfiremen.\n\n\n\nCessco manufactures insecticide aerosols and insecticide liquids.  \n\nCessco formulates and fills its own EPA registered products and also contract fills for other \n\ncompanies.  All products are formulated from EPA approved Confidential Statements of \n\nFormula. The concentrated active ingredients used in various formulas are pyrethrum, piperonyl \n\nbutoxide, permethrin, tetamethrin.  These \n\nactive ingredients are blended with solvents, those being Isopar M and LPA 170. \n\nPropellant used to fill the aerosols is Hydrocarbon AB-85 (flammable).  All of the \n\nchemicals except for AB-85 are brought into the plant in 5, 30, or 55 gallon containers.  \n\nAB-85 is received in bulk and put into storage tanks located on the northeast side of \n\nthe plant property.\n\n\n\nCessco currently complies with the rules and regulations set forth by the EPA, DOT, OSHA, \n\nDHEC, and local "

      "SummaryText": "agencies.  The Accidental Release prevention Program focuses on repeatedly \n\ntraining employees, (e.q. daily hands on training.)  Before any start up of equipment, it is \n\nrequired that all pumps, compressors, pressure gauges and pressure relief valves be inspected.\n\nBack-up and prevention systems are as follows:\n\n    \n\n1) Emergency shut-off systems for electrical, piping, and pumps. \n\n2) Backflow prevention valves.\n\n3) Excess flow valves.\n\n4) Pressure relief valves.\n\n5) Breakaway piping.\n\n6) 20 PSI blow out panels.\n\n7) Sprinkler systems.\n\n\n\nCessco has had no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\nCessco's Emergency Response Plan is coordinated directly with the St. Johns Fire Department \n\nand HAZMAT Response Team.  The nearest fire department is 2.5 miles away and response \n\ntime is five (5) minutes or less.\n\n\n\nCessco will continue hands on training of its personnel and monthly safety meetings.  There are \n\nno changes planned for the emergency shut down and prevention systems that are now in \n\nplace.  Our biggest challenge is keeping up to date on the many rule changes that take place with \n\nthe various government agencies. Cessco contracts with consultants at RegGuide, S&ME and Quantum Compliance \n\nwhen necessary to ensure that the company stays up-to-date in compliance with the rules and regulations of EPA, \n\nDOT, OSHA, DHEC, and local agencies.\n\n"
