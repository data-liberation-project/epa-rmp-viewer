      "SummaryText": "The Geocycle/Holcim hazardous waste derived fuels operation at Clarksville, Missouri is subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule as codified in 40 CFR 68.  This storage facility is operated by Geocycle and is on the grounds of Holcim cement plant where the waste fuel is burned as an alternative fuel in the cement manufacturing process.  This operation is subject to the RMP rules because the quantity of Vinyl Acetate Monomer, as designated toxic flammable material, handled and stored at the facility can exceed the 15,000 pound threshold.  The facility is subject as a Program Level 1 facility since the worst case hazard distance of 0.18 miles is contained on the facility property.  The submission is predictive since vinyl acetate is not always on site but is expected to be received frequently.\n\nThe Holcim and Geocycle management is committed to safe operations at the facility.  Both companies have Environmental, Health and Safety Policies that clearly commit company resources to maintaining safe operations protective of human health and the environment.  The facility also has an active Community Advisory Committee to provide an avenue for discussing health, safety, and environmental issues with our neighbors.\n\nThe Geocycle facility is a permitted Hazardous Waste Storage Facility located as part of the Holcim cement plant.  Holcim manufactures Portland cement by heating minerals extracted from the on-site quarry to produce clinker which is the primary component of the Portland cement.  Large amounts of fossil fuesl have historically been used to heat the process, but these have been reduced in recent years by burning other by-product streams to recover their energy value.  This includes hazardous waste derived fuels.  Hazardous Waste Derived Fuels consist of various chemicals, solvents, and oils that are blended at the Geocycle facility to produce a fuel meeting the exacting requirements of the Holcim operation.  Holcim/Geocycle uses 8 tanks ranging in size"

      "SummaryText": "from 40,000 gallons to 250,000 gallons each to blend and store the fuel.\n\nThe worst case scenario identified through this process involved the potential rupture of the 250,000 gallon waste fuel storage tanks into its secondary containment.  Since the facility uses administrative controls to ensure the vinyl acetate concentrations do not exceed 10% in that tank, the hazard distance of 0.18 miles results.  Administrative controls include the requirement that certain minimum volumes must be in the tanks prior to unloading trucks of the vinyl acetate waste stream, and the concentration of the vinyl acetate is monitored in the tanks to ensure that it does not exceed the self-imposed limits.\n\nThe facility has had an emergency response plan for many years and is active in the local emergency planning committee, hosting annual exercises at the plant.  The facility frequently reviews emergency response training, and all employees have been trained on what to do in the event of a release of vinyl acetate.\n\nThe Holcim/Geocycle management welcomes inquiries into our operations, and look forward to answering any questions that the public may have.  Please contact the EHS Manager if you have any questions."
