      "SummaryText": "Certainteed Corporation has been a leading manufacturer of PolyVinyl Chloride polymer in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area since 1975.  Certainteed is proud that the facility has had no reportable incidents that impact the public or environment in the last five years.  Hard work, training, and capital expenditures have contributed to minimize the potential of emergencies that could impact the public and/or environment.\n\nCertainteed strives to reduce the potential impact from accidents, chemical releases, and other natural disasters.  This is accomplished by developing training programs to educate everyone at the plant to become responsible for recognizing potential accidents and preventing them before they occur.  Programs such as OSHA's Process Safety Management and ISO 9002 are part of the daily operation.  Training and process reviews are constantly conducted to prevent accidents due to equipment failure or operations of the facility.\n\nCertainteed has a program and available equipment to respond to emergencies which may result in harm to employees, customers, the general public, and the enviromnent.  To achieve this objective, Certainteed has developed emergency plans and programs to address internal and external response actions, and to evaluate risks of existing and new equipment systems.  The facility also actively participates in the Calcasieu Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness programs and has been a member of the Southwest Louisiana Mutual Aid Association since 1975.  Certainteed conducts readiness training and exercises to ensure effective emergency response capability is available, if necessary.  These exercises are evaluated to assess results and implement corrective actions."
