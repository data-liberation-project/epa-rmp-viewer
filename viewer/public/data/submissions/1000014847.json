This facility has been designed in a manner that minimizes the potential for accidental releases. Shintech is committed to operating this facility in a manner that is safe for the plant workers, the public, and the environment. Shintech has many years of experience and an excellent environmental and safety track record in the production of polyvinyl chloride. Shintech strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. Shintech has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Addis Plant A facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter.59). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Addis Plant A facility. An initial RMPlan for the Addis Plant A facility (formerly referred to as the Shintech Facility) was submitted to EPA in November 2000.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.190, the facility's RMPlan has been revised and updated as necessary.  To satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.165, an offsite consequence analysis for chlorine and vinyl chloride is being submitted in the RMP information.

A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The Addis Plant A facility utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. The facility has fully staffed and trained emergency response teams for fire fighting and emergency rescue. In addition to handling the release, the facility is also participating in established communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release. Through the coordination with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the facility has the ability to provide emergency notification to the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, siren system, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\n\nThe Shintech Environmental Supervisor has responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for the facility.  The Safety Supervisor is responsible for the implementation of the facility process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program. However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program will be delegated to other personnel who will report either directly or through other management personnel to the Environmental and/or Safety Supervisor. Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and emergency response plan has been delegated to the Environmental Supervisor. Furthermore, it is the facility's policy that sa"

The facility uses vinyl chloride monomer as raw material. This substance (vinyl chloride) is flammable substance that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and will be present in the facility's process above the EPA established threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe Addis Plant A facility also handles one toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in a sufficient quantity to be handled by the RMP rule:\n        \nChlorine is used in the chlorination of cooling tower water and sanitary water.  \n\n      1.3     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBecause the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the facility, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n      Employee Participation\n\nShintech will encourage employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program will be documented in an employee participation plan that will be maintained at the facility and will address each accident prevention program element.\n\n      Process Safety Information\n\nThe Addis Plant A facility will keep a variety of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known concerns and hazards associated. In addition, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals. Shintech will ensure that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nShintech will also maintain numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n      Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Addis Plant A facility has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, the covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards ensuring that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe facility primarily uses the \"What If\" and \"HAZOP\" analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n      Operating Procedures\n\nThe Addis Plant A facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the facility's operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n      Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Addis Plant A facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.
