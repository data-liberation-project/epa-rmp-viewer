Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each covered unit. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHAs are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n4.    Standard Operating Procedures\n\nWritten standard operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery units.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical team, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  \n\n5.    EHS Operator Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the units are provided with comprehensive initial training and periodic refresher training.

Training is conducted using a combination of classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training. Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n6.    Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures & guidelines describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures & guidelines follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI/PM activities are trained on the procedures & guidelines and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \n\n7.    Management of Change\n\nPermanent or temporary changes may inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of an area. A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the refinery. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The Eagle Point Refinery uses a computer-based software program to assist in tracking and processing change requests. Results of the Management of Change proce"

Pre-startup Safety Review\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews are performed by experienced teams as a final check to ensure the safety of new or modified process facilities before they are placed in service. The review ensures that the following requirements are confirmed prior to start-up: construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; PHAs have been performed on new processes and all recommendations have been resolved; PSI documentation has been properly updated and made available to personnel; MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes; and training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees.\n\n9.    Compliance Audits\n\nCompliance Audits ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the accidental release prevention programs are being followed. A formal evaluation and certification of the programs is conducted every year by an audit team. The compliance audit team seeks to confirm that practices are consistent with written programs that the programs adequately address all requirements of the process safety regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance. Refinery management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and tracks all findings until they are resolved.\n\n10.    EHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation\n\nAn experienced team promptly initiates an investigation of incidents (within 48 hours) that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.
