Harrisburg, NC Distribution Center\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at LaRoche Industries Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqueous Ammonia to customers via trailers.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous) and Ammonia (aqueous) both of which are sold to customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 741015.25 lb. while Ammonia (aqueous >20%) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 150419.81 lb.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Anhydrous Ammonia Storage.  In this scenario 160000 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.   At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.6 miles is obta"
