Monitoring results by the AMTs in the community did not detect any readings that would have required any community evacuations or shelter-in-place actions. Communications between members of the community and non-refinery personnel during the incident resulted in precautionary actions being taken.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards. Catlettsburg Refining, LLC primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. Checklists are utilized to evaluate Human Factors and Facility Siting. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise and a trained team leader. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention. All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.
