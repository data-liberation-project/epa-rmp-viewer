Facilty Policy:\n    The owners, management and employees of the Manning Agricultural Center, Inc. are committed to\nthe prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur,\nthe facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, regional Hazmat team, or other authorities to mitigate and minimize\nthe impacts of the release to the people and environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia\nis received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n    Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in two ( 2 ) anhydrous ammonia tanks of 12,000 gallon \ncapacity each and 22 nurse tanks for a total capacity of 201,000#\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario -- ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n    a. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as\n         gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 52020 pounds, which \n        represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design \n        standards. The distance to the end point ( point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm ) is \n       1.45 miles. \n\n   b. The alternate release scenario , based on the five-year accident history ( or the most likely potential \n       incident), is a release from a brreak in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint ( point of \n      dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles. The release would last for 2 (two) minutes, when human \n      intervention and/or excess flow valve would stop the release.\n\n4. Accident Release Prevention Program\n    The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \" Safety Requirements\n    for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,"

The 1989 ANSI Standard    has been adopted by reference by Iowa Adm. Code Part 21-Ch 43- Rule 43.6 (200) - Standard for the\n    storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. The OSHA standard is references in the Registration \n    form Section 8.3, b. \n\n5. Five year Accident History\n   There have been no accidental released of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused\n    any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in \n   off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or enviromental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n    The facility has:\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR 1910.38;\n    b. provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information\n        as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess\n   the maintence of the safe conditions.\n   There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia\n   for implementation at this time."
