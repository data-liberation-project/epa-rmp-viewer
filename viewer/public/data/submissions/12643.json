Additionally, this new regulation, 40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Program, Risk Management Plan, will further enhance Sierra Chemical Co. commitment to risk management.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled:  Sierra Chemical Co., Sparks Facility, consists of three operations involving highly hazardous materials.  The first operation is a chlorine transfer and sodium hypochlorite manufacturing (bleach) process.  Chlorine is received at the facility via 90 ton railcars.  There is typically one railcar and a number of filled small packagings on site for a total of 202,150 pounds.  It is repackaged into 17 ton tank trucks, 1 ton containers, and 150 pound cylinders.  Additionally, the facility manufactures sodium hypochlorite (bleach) utilizing chlorine as a reactant.  The second operation is a sulfur dioxide transfer and sodium bisulfite manufacturing process.  Sulfur dioxide is received at the facility via 90 ton railcars.  There is typically one railcar and a number of filled small packagings on site for a total of 196,400 pounds.  It is repackaged into 17 ton tank trucks, 1 ton containers, and 150 pound cylinders.  Additionally, the facility manufactures sodium bisulfite utilizing sulfur dioxide as a reactant. The third operation is a anhydrous ammonia container handling and storage process.  Anhydrous ammonia containers, 1730 pound skid tanks and 150 pound cylinders, are received at the facility and stored pending delivery to consumers.  Typical inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 16,990 pound"

      "SummaryText": "s.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenarios:  Because sulfur dioxide and chlorine are received at the facility via 90 ton railcars, complying with Department of Transportation regulations, the worst-case scenario for the facility would be the release of the contents of 1 railcar.  This scenario was chosen based on the requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 68.  However, in contrast to the required worst-case release scenario, Sierra Chemial Co. chose the failure of a 1 inch flexible transfer line for the alternate release scenario for both products.  This scenario was chosen because with the exception of the railcar and the flexible transfer line, all other process components handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide are located inside an enclosure equipped with a fume scrubber. Furthermore, through actuated valves located on both the railcar and the process side of the flexible transfer line and  detectors located at the railcars interlocked with the actuated valves, it was estimated that the flow of chlorine or sulfur dioxide could be stopped within 1 minute.  Modelling for all scenarios was completed utilizing RMP*Comp, Version 1.06, as provided by EPA.  Modelling for the worst-case release scenario demostrated potential off-site impacts to residential, schools, hospitals, county and city parks, national forest, and industrial facilities.  In contrast, modelling for the alternate release scenarios demostrated potential off-site impacts to adjacent industrial facilities only.  For the anhydrous ammonia container storage and handling, the alternate release scenario was chosen as a leaking valve on a 1730 pound skid tank that took response personnel 180 minutes to mitigate.   Modelling for this alternate release scenario demonstrated potential off-site impacts to adjacent industrial facilities only.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  Sierra Chemical Co. achieves accidental release prevent"
