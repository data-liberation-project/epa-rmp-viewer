The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA, with the threshold quantity being 10,000 lbs.  Currently the system contains approximately 18,000 lbs, which requires reporting to EPA.  It is the policy of Apple House Warehouse & Storage, Inc to operate in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Inspections show the design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry and governmental agencies.\n\nThe safety of our employees, neighbors and the environment are very important to management.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, Standard Operating Procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.  Some safety devices utilized are:\n  Suction trap hi-level floats\n  High discharge pressure shut down  \n  Low suction pressure shut down\n  High discharge temperature shut down\n  Oil pressure failure shut down\n  250 psi relief valves on high pressure side (to prevent overpressure situations)\n  150 psi relief valves on low pressure side (to prevent overpressure situations)\n  High amperes shut down\n  Automatic timer to prevent short cycling\n  Oil filters plugged shut down\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC 296-67-017, including an Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-62-3112.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with local emergenc"

      "SummaryText": "y responders.  It is the policy of Apple House Warehouse & Storage, Inc not to respond to large releases of ammonia.  Therefore, employees will be trained on evacuation procedures at least once every year.  The responding fire or hazmat team will take control of the situation upon their arrival.  Other preventative steps are found in our process hazard assessment, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot work permits and compliance audits.\n\nAccess to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and contractors.  All visitors and contractors are required to sign in and wear a quest badge while on premises.  Contractors are required to provide evidence of experience and training in ammonia safety before working around the system.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.\n\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at this facility in the past five years.\n\nPer the previous owners of this facility all system components were designed with specifications approved by ANSI/IIAR.  All pressure vessels were built according to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.  Any upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at the time."
