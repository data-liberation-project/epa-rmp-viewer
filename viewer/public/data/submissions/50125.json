This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L L C. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Morgan?s Point Complex located in Harris County, Texas is owned by Enterprise Products Operating, L L C. and is operated by Enterprise.  \n\nThe Morgan?s Point Complex is a hydrocarbon storage and terminal facility capable of receiving, storing and and shipping flammable hydrocaronbs and hydrocarbon mixtures.  The facility currently handles a flammable isobutane product, a flammable isobutylene product, a flammable alkylate / naptha product, and ethanol.  Liquids are primarily received at the facility via pipeline and barge, but can also be received by rail tank car or tanker truck delivery.  Received liquids are stored in above ground storage tanks pending sale or shipment.  Liquids are shipped out of the terminal via pipeline, barge, rail tank car and tanker trucks.  The Morgan?s Point facility also has equipment available that was formerly used for alykylation, fractionation and methyl-tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) production.  This equipment is currently shut down and is not being used.   \n\nThe Morgan?s Point Complex was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and qua"

Listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Morgan?s Point Complex are a mixed flammable isobutane product, a mixed flammable isobutylene product, and a flammable alkylate / naptha product.   Ethanol is also received and stored at the facility, but is exempt from the RMP regulation. The storage operations are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and are classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.  \n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Morgan?s Point Complex.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the plant?s PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involv"

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a ?near-miss? reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rat"

This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Morgan?s Point Complex has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the storage and terminal operations are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each operation is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at"

Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Morgan?s Point Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of storage and terminal operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered operations must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Morgan?s Point Complex has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas and fractionation plant operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify"

The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nEnterprise incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps insure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Morgan?s Point Complex has long standing safe work practices in place to help insure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to insure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to insure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help insure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Morgan?s Point Complex has a comprehensive system to manage change to all covered equipment and operations.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to insure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Morgan?s Point Complex promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help insure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Morgan?s Point Complex have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered operations at the Morgan?s Point Complex.
