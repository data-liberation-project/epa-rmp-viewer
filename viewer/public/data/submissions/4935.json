      "SummaryText": "Dutch Quality House-III is a poultry processing facility that stores and uses a chemical that is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  This chemical is Ammonia for refrigeration.  We currently have maximum storage capacity of 11,000 pounds of Ammonia at the Dutch Quality-III facility.\n\nDutch Quality House-III believes that the ammonia we store and handle on site has very real and potential danger.   However, it is important to keep the risks in perspective.  Dutch Quality House-III's ammonia storage and handling facilities:\n1.  are properly designed\n2.  have effective operation and maintenance procedures\n3.  employ trained operators and tecchnicians\n4.  periodically conduct safety audits, and\n5. are constantly upgrading its processes to meet or exceed industry standards\n\nDutch Quality House-III also has taken a proactive approach towards coordinating emergency efforts with the Fire Department.  The Coffee County E.M.A. has a copy of our emergency response program and is well trained and prepared to respond to the potential spills and leaks that may occur at the Dutch Quality House-III facility.  The Douglas Fire Department conducts annual site visits to our facility and is prepared to respond to a possible spill or leak.\n\nA facility which maintains high standards, such as Dutch Quality House -III, provides less public risk than a facility that does not provide safe operations.  Dutch Quality House-III complies with Federal OSHA rules and guidelines for safe handling, storage and operation of ammonia systems.  We also utilize outside ammonia system experts to periodically inspect our systems integrity and train system operators.  As a result of Dutch Quality House-III's safety program, Dutch Quality House III has had no releases of ammonia which resulted in any off site injury or illiness in the past five years.\n\nBecause of the large quantities of ammonia CGC-Dutch Quality House-III stores on site, there is a very small probability that there could be off-site"

      "SummaryText": " consequences if a major leak occurred.  Dutch Quality House-III used EPA's OCA Guidance for off-site consequence analysis of ammonia.\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (11,000 pounds in 10 minutes), a .6 mile radius around the Dutch Quality House-III facility may have to be notified and possibly evacuated.  According to 1990 Census Data, 322 people in the surrounding community may be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.\n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nDuring the past five years Dutch Quality House-III has had several small releases of ammonia to the atmosphere.  The largest of these small releases was 500 pounds, which occurred as a result of a leaking high pressure pipe.  This 500 pound release was used to determine an alternatiave-release scenario, which would result in a release of ammonia that would only travel .2 mile and may, according to 1990 Census Data, require 52 people in the surrounding community to be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.\n\nCONCLUSION\nPoultry Divison believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform the public of the potential dangers and the actions that CGC has taken to minimize these dangers.  Dutch Quality House-III (one of the larger employers in Coffee County) has a long-great ongoing relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Coffee County."
