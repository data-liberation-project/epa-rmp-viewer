It is our policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia was to occur, it is our policy to notify the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Eudora Feed and Grain facility stores and handles anhydrous ammonia for direct retail sale to end users.  The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 52,800 pounds stored in one  bulk storage vessel (18,000 gallons).  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered by truck and distributed into smaller tanks for use as a fertilizer.\n\nWorst-Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe scenarios were conducted using the RMP*Comp program as provided by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario involved a catastrophic release of the total contents of an 18,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage vessel at the facility.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14 milligrams per liter (mg/L) was 2.6 miles.  The alternative release scenario involved a release from a transfer hose failure.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14 mg/L was 0.1 mile.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Eudora Feed and Grain facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The facility was designed and installed and is maintained in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Eudora Feed and Grain facility has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nIn the event of an emergency inv"
