      "SummaryText": "Travis County Water Control and Improvement District No. 17, a political subdivision of the State of Texas, is located in western Travis County, Texas, in the general area between Lake Travis and Lake Austin.  The District encompasses approximately 14,300 acres and is located in a semi-rural, primarily residential and recreational area.  Water District 17 has approximately 5,700 connections and serves approximately 16,900 people with potable water.  Parts of the District?s service area are located within the jurisdiction of the City of Austin and the City of Lakeway.\n\nThe water treatment plant is located on the banks of the Colorado River and uses chlorine gas as a water disinfectant.  Prior to June of 2001, the chlorine for disinfection was stored in 150-pound cylinders.  However, the District has since converted to the use of ton cylinders for storage of chlorine.  The maximum supply stored on-site is approximately 8,000 pounds.\n\nThe process system consists of six (6) one-ton stainless steel cylinders and an all vacuum feed / injection system.  Four of the six one-ton cylinders are kept in service during normal operation and two are used as spare.  A chlorine leak detector, set to 1 ppm, with sensors mounted approximately 1-inch above the floor is connected to an audible alarm system that also pages the operator in the event of an emergency.  The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times a day by an on-site operator and is monitored daily on the weekends.  Preventative maintenance is performed regularly with the equipment serviced annually regardless of condition.\n\nField personnel and the general manager receive formal training as required by 29 CFR 1910.120, in conjunction with the locl fire department personnel, in emergency response for water/wastewater treatment facilities.  This training includes hands on experience with SCBA, Level A suits, and liquid and gas identification.  Emergency equipment is maintained on-site.\n\nTravis County WC&ID No"

      "SummaryText": ". 17 has developed an Emergency Response Plan, which is maintained on-site at the District office adjacent to the plant.  In the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas, emergency response will be coordinated with Travis County Emergency Service District No. 6.  Travis County ESD No. 6 is located approximately 3 minutes from the water treatment plant and the Lake Travis Medical Clinic is located approximately 5 minutes from the plant.  There have been no reportable accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past ten years."
