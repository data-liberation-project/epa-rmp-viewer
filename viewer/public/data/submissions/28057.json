The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe worst case scenario is the complete rupture of the completely full epichlorohydrin tank.  The tank contents would be released immediately into the secondary containment diked area.  Using the EPA OCA methodology, the material would evaporate at a rate of 22.7 lb./min., and would create an area with concentrations above the  toxic threshold out to a distance of 0.6 miles (3190 ft.).  The list of potentially impacted receptors is:\n1. Palmer Industries\n2. NJ Transit bus repair facility\n3. Sun Oil facility\n4. Reichold Chemical facility\n5. General Chemical facility\n6.
