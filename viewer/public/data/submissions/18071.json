Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Trico Ag Service Incorporated in Hancock are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Hancock Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in an 18,000- and two 6,000-gallon interconnected tanks at our facility in Hancock\n(Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (131,223 lbs.) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\nperiod.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and an urban topography, the\nmaximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure"

The\nscenario involves the release of 7995.83 lbs. of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 miles (Figure 3).\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTrico Ag Service Incorporated maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix E).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nTrico Ag Service Incorporated maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within\nour covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation;\nthe information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nTrico Ag Service Incorporated has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\nthese processes (Appendix C).\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTrico Ag Service Incorporated conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\nensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous\ntraining in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive ma"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix D).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Trico Ag Service Incorporated to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nTrico Ag Service Incorporated routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes\nand modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTrico Ag Service Incorporated conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether\nthe plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-\ncompliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nTrico Ag Service Incorporated truly believes that process safety management and accident\nprevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views\nconcerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees\nhave access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP,\nparticularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nTrico Ag Service Incorporated has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the\nlast 5 years.
