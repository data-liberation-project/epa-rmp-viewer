The RMP team (Mike Walker, David Bryant and Mike Elliott who are all knowledgeable in the process) found the facility and its construction to be in compliance with PSM and RMP.  The Process Hazard analysis was reviewed and found to be in order.  The 13 elements of the PSM program were reviewed (audited) and found to be in good order.  Ammonia release scenarios were formulated for worst  and an alternate case scenarios; the findings were for the alternate case scenario  with a release of 6000 pounds in 60 minutes, the distance to the toxic end point is .19 miles and affects a population 17 residents and three commercial receptors.  The worst case scenario consisted of a 4,321 pound release for 10 minutes, the toxic end point is .30 miles, effects 43 residents, and 3 commercial receptors."
