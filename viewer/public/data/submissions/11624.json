This facility is a farm cooperative.  We store and deliver bulk propane for residential and commercial heating purposes.  We also store and provide for application, anhydrous ammonia, dry fertilizers, and several dry and liquid herbicides.  The propane system consists of one 26,000 gallon storage vessel from which our supply truck draws off propane for distribution.  It is refilled by the vendor's bulk tanker.  The anhydrous ammonia system consists of one 18,00 gallon storage tank  The ammonia is supplied by the vendor's bulk tanker, and is used to fill nurse tanks.  The nurse tank filling procedure is performed by our own employees. .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 THE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS.
