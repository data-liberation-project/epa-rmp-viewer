This facility complies with NFPA 58 requirements and Wisconsin Comm 11 for LP-Gas storage, and Wisconsin Comm 43 for ammonia storage, and it is our pol;icy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our pol;icy to contact the Hartford Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n                                                                                                                                                                             A DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.  This facility is a farm cooperative.  We store and deliver bulk propane for residential and commercial heating purposes.  We also store and provide for application, anhydrous ammonia, dry fertilizers, and several dry and liquid herbicides.  The propane system consists of one 26,000 gallon storage vessel from which our supply truck draws off propane for distribution.  It is refilled by the vendor's bulk tanker.  The anhydrous ammonia system consists of one 18,00 gallon storage tank  The ammonia is supplied by the vendor's bulk tanker, and is used to fill nurse tanks.  The nurse tank filling procedure is performed by our own employees. .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 THE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS.
