      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and staff of the Safeway Spokane Distribution Center are committed to operating the Plant with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment. To ensure the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment, the Plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CCFR Part 68. The policies and procedures integrated under the Plant's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nDescription of Processes, and Regulated Substances Handled at the Safeway Spokane Distribution Center\n\nThe Safeway Spokane Distribution Center conducts refrigerated warehousing and distribution for food products that require refrigeration. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the two refrigeration systems (North and South systems) at the Safeway Spokane Distribution Center. Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: Liquid storage; Expansion; Evaporation; Compression; and Condensation. Mechanical refrigeration is a physical process, rather than a chemical process: the ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the refrigeration cycle. Heat is removed from the product being refrigerated or frozen as ammonia changes phase from liquid to vapor. By reliquefying the ammonia vapor, the ammonia can be used continuously in the refrigeration cycle.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are the only processes at the Safeway Spokane Distribution Center, which are subject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard, and the CalARP program). Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system. At ambient temperature and pressure, ammo"

The chemical formula of ammonia is NH3. Anhydrous ammonia is handled both as a pressurized liquid at ambient temperature and as a refrigerated liquid within the Safeway Spokane Distribution Center refrigeration systems .\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Safeway Spokane Distribution Center facility has an Emergency Action Plan in effect. The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Safeway Spokane Distribution Center maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nThe Safeway Spokane Distribution Center has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire\ndepartment and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm. In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Safeway Spokane Distribution Center to evacuate and to allow the fire department and the refrigeration contractors to respond to the emergency.

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the Safeway Spokane Distribution Center facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The Safeway Spokane Distribution Center facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable codes and standards which specifically outline requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include emergency stop buttons and pressure relief valves. All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that relieve to atmosphere.\n\nIn addition to the appropriate design codes, the facility will operate in accordance with the\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. In particular, the IIAR 6-2019 Standard for \"Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Closed - Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\" \n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its\nthreshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\nOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\nKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering\nin place (\u00a768.42(a)).\"\n\nA review of the facility's accident history revealed that there have been no significant releases of\nammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years\n(February 2020 - February 2025). In addition, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet\nthe RMP definition of \"a"

Personnel will attempt to shut off equipment if possible, and proceed to the meeting place upwind of the facility by observing the windsock posted throughout the facility. Supervisors will conduct a headcount to be sure everyone is accounted for utilizing the daily employee schedules, sign in book, and on site contractor list.\n\nAmmonia is a strongly alkaline substance that can result in irritation or damage to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Liquid ammonia can also cause freeze burns to unprotected skin. In the event that an employee is injured on the job, the Senior Person in Charge will be notified to determine the necessary course of action. If the injury is life threatening, 911 will be called immediately. If an employee is exposed to ammonia enough that it has caused burning and irritation, the area of exposure will be flushed with cool water for 15 minutes or longer.

All employees at Safeway Spokane Distribution Center will be given emergency response training during New Employee Orientation and Department Safety Meetings. At least annual emergency evacuation drills are held at the facility.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe PSM/RMP prevention program elements have been integrated into the Safeway Spokane Distribution Center's management system framework, in accordance with internationally recognized principles of total\nquality management. The management system is designed to ensure implementation of each program element, in compliance with the OSHA PSM standard, and the EPA RMP rule.

The means of documenting compliance have been improved for each prevention program element."
