The NAICS code is 31162.  The facility has approximately 587 full time employees and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year.\n\n\n\nThis Plan informs all interested parties that this facility is participating in the OSHA Process\n\nSafety Management (PSM) program defined in 29 CFR 1910.119 and the EPA Risk Management\n\nProgram (RMP) defined in 40 CFR Part 68. These programs provide for the implementation of detailed\n\nPrevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\n\n \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP\n\nprograms. This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat\n\ntemperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas. Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility. This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.\n\n \n\nThe offsite consequences of analysis was determined utilizing the online browser based RMP comp and the population data is based upon information pulled from Marplot on 05/10/2016. How to determine the WCS & ARS was derived from the Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities (May 2004).\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the\n\nsystem, included are: high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and low pressure automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before s"

      "SummaryText": "hutdowns occur.\n\n\n\n This facilities emergency response program is an action plan to respond to and resolve incidents\n\nAssociated with the ammonia refrigeration system. The Fire Department / Hazmat Team will be notified so that they can provide assistance during an incident. If it is necessary to contact the public regarding an\n\nAmmonia release, the local fire department will be contacted to coordinate with the police department. The police department will notify residents and business locations.\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable release in the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews,\n\nMechanical Integrity inspections, Preventative Maintenance activity, equipment inspections, and training to ensure mitigation and control of potential incidents.\n\n \n\nThe facility will make changes to the system and train as necessary to resolve items noted during\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audit, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and Mechanical Integrity\n\nInspections to improve the safety of the system. Changes will be placed on an action list, evaluated, and\n\nImplemented in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nThe reason for the increase in the off-site consequence analysis and the ammonia inventory is due to a change from using the actual ammonia level to using the maximum fill level (80%) in the high pressure receiver and from using the actual ammonia charge to using the maximum intended inventory in the system.\n\n"
