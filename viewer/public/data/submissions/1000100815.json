Hydrogen Distribution Services, also an Air Liquide Company, commonly referred to as (HDS) operates a tractor trailer terminal at this location.  Various trailer sizes and styles contain liquified and or gaseous hydrogen.  Because HDS operates this terminal location with hydrogen, a Regulated Substance over the Threshold Quantity of 10,000 pounds, and stores, handles, and controls the on-site movement of this Regulated Substance; this HDS terminal location is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68)  as well as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program under California's Code of Regulations Title 19.  CalARP includes some additional state requirements and is implemented at the local government level by the Certified Unified Program Agencies (CUPA's) which determine the level of detail in the RMPs, review RMPs, conduct facility inspections and provide public access to RMP information. The San Bernardino County Fire Department (CUPA) is the implementing agency for the HDS South Terminal covered process. HDS and Airgas' commitment to safety and environmental protection extends beyond its gates. As part of the community, we have a responsibility to our customers and to those who live in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nRegulated Chemical and Covered Process:\r\n\r\nHDS operates Department of Transportation (DOT) certified mobile tractors and tanker trailers. HDS tractors transport liquid and/or gaseous hydrogen trailers to and from the South Terminal Facility. It is possible that full or partially filled trailers will be parked at the terminal for twenty-four hours or a longer period.  HDS provides cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH2) UN 1966,"

HDS will also provide gaseous hydrogen (GH2) to customers in California. The gaseous hydrogen, UN1049, CAS number 1333-74-0, will arrive at the facility in 450 Bar trailers. When a liquid hydrogen trailers or gaseous hydrogen tube trailers arrive, they will be parked in designated locations and the motive tractor disconnected and separately parked in identified positions.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe highly flammable and hazardous nature of hydrogen in the process makes it necessary for HDS to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  HDS' policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. This Executive Summary sets forth some of the management systems in place to implement the accidental release and prevention program. HDS has also implemented specific chemical prevention steps to help prevent potential scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. The following examples of the types of safety features in place: (1) Release Mitigation - Emergency stop buttons to isolate hydrogen sources; personal protective equipment (personal gas detectors, protective outerwear clothing, intrinsically safe devices, safety goggles, shoes, etc.) (2) System Integrity - Automatic control and manual valves that provides isolation for hydrogen vessels from hydrogen equipment located in the trailers control cabinet.  Pressure Safety Valves and Thermal Pressure Relief Devices are located on the various hydrogen vessels. (3) Facility and Environment - Contracted emergency response specialist, Safety-Kleen, to support the HDS South Terminal emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nEmployee Partic"

Employees are trained on and provided access to the hydrogen process safety information. Specific actions an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan. Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation.  Employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed, and they are involved in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they remain current, accurate and recommend any necessary changes.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\n\r\nHDS keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and in the company's electronic document control system that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all key information for operating the process safely.  Process operators are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these safe operating limits.  The Terminal Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily accessible as part of the written employee participation.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nHDS/Airgas has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

Facility Manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the action plan to closure.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures (OP)\r\n\r\nHDS/Airgas maintains controlled written procedures that address various modes of liquefied and gaseous hydrogen process operations, such as: (1) initial startup; (2) normal operations; (3) emergency shutdown; (4) normal shutdown and; (5) startup after turnaround or emergency shutdown. The hydrogen transfer operation will not operate under temporary or emergency operations. If these conditions occur, plant operators and management will evaluate the circumstances and either shut the plant down or complete an MOC, including and emergency MOC. Additionally, the emergency shutdown procedure includes conditions that will prompt a shutdown and identifies qualified and\r\nresponsible operators to complete the steps in a safe and timely manner.  Airgas operating procedures have safe operating limits identified along with consequences of unsafe deviation. Procedures further provide steps for operators to take that will correct or avoid an unsafe\r\ndeviation.

      "SummaryText": "Plan (EAC). The plan outlines action to be taken at the HDS South Terminal for handling small releases, and if larger the communication to emergency responders, local response agencies, and outside agency notification procedures in the event of a hydrogen release. The emergency plan provides for the evacuation of HDS South Terminal personnel, contractors and visitors. The HDS South Terminal has provided their emergency response plan to and coordinates the plan annually with the local Rancho Cucamonga Fire Department, part of the San Bernardino County Fire Department (CUPA). Should an emergency involving the release of hydrogen occur that will have off-site consequences HDS South Terminal management will contact the Rancho Cucamonga Fire Department and local support authorities, who will coordinate action for the affected community.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nSafety is an inherent part of the culture at the HDS South Terminal and enhancements in safety and operations are actively discussed and supported. The HDS South Terminal continues to review its processes for possibilities of improvement to the covered hydrogen process, operational methods, and new technology to lower risk. In conclusion of our most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), the HDS South Terminal plans to:\r\n(1) Add Glad Hand locks to isolate quarantined trailers from connection to a tractor while parked at the South Terminal\r\n(2) Signage to indicate hazardous and restricted areas of operation  \r\n(3) Camera installation to monitor the HDS South Terminal for safety and security purposes."
