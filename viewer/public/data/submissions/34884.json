The hazards identified is communicated to those performing the work and to operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process.  The BOC Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work.   The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures. BOC's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was review in June 2003 for both employees and contractors.\n \nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than replacement in kind.

The management and employees of the Bellingham facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, purification, and distribution of Carbon Dioxide. A support process to this operation involves the use of ammonia.  Ammonia is use in a refrigeration system which cools part of the carbon dioxide production process.  Ammonia is received from a bulk Ammonia Supplier via a Bulk Trailer and stored in a 6000 gallon tank. The system contains a maximum of 25,500 pounds of ammonia.  The ammonia is then used in a closed refrigeration system.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release and the alternative release were determined using EPA's RMPComp* ver. 1.07.  Results can be reviewed by contacting the facility.\n\nThe impacted area was  based on the 2000 US Census data obtained from Land View V.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include a water deluge system, check valves, a preventive maintenance schedule, and safeties.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.

This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of ammonia. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The new PHA was completed in May 22, 2003 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review on June 11, 2003 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.

The training program was last reviewed on June 11, 2003.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified.

The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete.
