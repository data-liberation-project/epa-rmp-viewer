ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\nAt Simmons Foods, we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Simmons strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Jay  Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of poultry products.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 7,800 pounds.  We have the capacity for 13,000 pounds but our written policy limits our storage to 60% of total capacity.\n\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S)"

      "SummaryText": ", INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of our only receiver.  Simmons policy restricts the maximum capacity of this 4,250 pound tank to 60% of capacity.  The greatest amount stored in that tank is 2,571 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a two phase flow (gas and aerosol-ALOHA).  \nDistance to endpoint: 0.78 miles (1,365 yards)\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure release valve.  The emergency valves shut-down release would engage and stop the flow or an alarm would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 14 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 495 pounds of ammonia.\nDistance to endpoint:  0.14miles (249 yards)\n\n\n4.   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nTo date, this Simmons Foods facility has had no releases.\n\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by David Stone and Dennis Padgett.  Mr. Stone and Mr. Padgett will administrate in conjunction with the Simmons Foods management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Delaware County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Jay Fire Department and HAZMAT team.\n\n\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThe Simmons Foods facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA\u0012s Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom training plus On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are given written tests and are observed in order to demonstrate proper job skills and knowl"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nWe work very closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Jay Fire Department and HAZMAT team on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\nCurrently, Simmons Foods trains all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our total ammonia Process Safety Program is updated annually.  Our program is improved continuously through annual updating of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available."
