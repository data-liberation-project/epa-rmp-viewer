THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     The owners, management and employees of United Farmers Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities to mitigate  any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  THE FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     - The primary activity at the facility is the storage of propane for the delivery to farmers.\n\n     - Propane is received and stored for direct delivery to farmers.\n\n     - The maximum quantity of propane stored would be 240,000 pounds in our 1-30,000 gallon tank and 3-12,000 gallon tanks.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n     a. The worst case scenario is a vapor cloud explosion causing a 1psi over pressure to distance of .43 miles. The maximum quantity released would be 110,000 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario is a vapor cloud explosion causing a 1psi over pressure to a distance of (factor .67 x .43 miles = .29 miles) .29 miles. The maximum quantity released would be 110,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions and standards of NFPA-58 Rules.\n\n5.  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of propane in the past five years.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n     - The facility has:\n     a. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29CRF 1910.38;\n\n     b. provided State and Local authorities the Emergency Plan"
