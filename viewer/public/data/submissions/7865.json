The program in place covers all aspects of OSHA's CFR 1910.\n\nRCSD has a program for employees covering lockout tag-out and Personnel Protective Clothing (PPE), PPE testing emergency response training, and confined space training. Yearly inspections are performed on all aspects of the process along with outside inspectors in the evaluation of the process.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance\n\nRCSD is a two building, multi-story-refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia for the refrigerant. It is located at 420 North 18th Street, Richmond, Virginia 23223. The warehouse, which was completed in 1911and 1918, has 82250 square feet to store frozen commodities as low as -10 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two stage recirculated system with reciprocating compressors. It utilizes a roof top evaporative condenser.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario is the high-pressure receiver, which can hold up to 2008 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. If this vessel was damaged and all 2008 pounds released over a 10 minute period (the required assumption by the Risk Management Program parameters), 200 ppm could rea"

There is no passive mitigation system to mitigate the release of gas.\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario, which is more likely, would be a pipe leak that could leak approximately 100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within a 10-minute period. A toxic endpoint level of 200 ppm is 0.1 miles from the release point as calculated by the OCA Guidance Analysis. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe engineers have been trained to follow the PSM program guidelines established for this facility. Employees participate in regular safety meetings, safety inspections, and annual training classes on ammonia safety.\n\nA preventative maintenance program and facility check lists provide routine inspection of the refrigeration system. An annual inspection following the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses (IIAR) guidelines is performed on the equipment.\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\n There have been no accidental releases at this facility during the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program includes coordination with the local LEPC and the City of Richmond Fire Department\n                 \nThe facility engineers have received the 24 hour Emergency Responder Training and receive an annual 8 hour Responder Refresher Course.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRCSD plans to improve its safety program in 1999 in several ways. A program has been put into place to evaluate the Process Safety Management Program annually. A training program has been put in place to inform and provide additional information to employees about company safety programs. Our insurance company provides regular inspections of our equipment. This includes infrared scans of all electrical switch gear and vessel inspection.\n\n\n"
