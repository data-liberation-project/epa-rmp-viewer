The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to six (6) precool rooms, ten (10) cold storage rooms, a repack room, and a shipping area. The precool and cold storage rooms utilize bunker mounted evaporators while the repack room and shipping area utilized ceiling suspended evaporators. A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\r\n\r\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel mounted on the roof. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room. From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to a thermosyphon vessel and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporate"

Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into the liquid transfer vessel. Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers. There are three high pressure receivers, however, they are piped together so that they act in concert.\r\n\r\nThe facility was originally built in 2000. More recently the following projects have occurred:\r\n- 2001 California Controlled Atmosphere supplied and installed the refrigeration equipment for Phase 2\r\n- 2006 California Controlled Atmosphere supplied and installed the refrigeration equipment for Phase 3\r\n- 2008 California Controlled Atmosphere supplied and installed the refrigeration equipment for the\r\nRepack Room\r\n\r\nAll of the different phases were built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected. Lastly, an emergency dump box contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are colocated such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, the facility is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General\r\n\r\nWe inform"
