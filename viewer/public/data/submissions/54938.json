              "Description": "Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide are reacted individually or in series with other raw materials to form the majority of our products.  Therefore , the use of EO and PO is considered as one process for our site.\n\nAll of the prevention program elements are common to both systems, except for two additional safeguards or mitigation measures on the EO storage.  Both EO and PO storage employ diking,  pressure, temperature and level control and alarms, and suitable safety relief devices.  In addition, EO storage utilizes a cooling exchanger to keep the stored EO below 45 degrees F and has a provision to send the EO through an emergency scrubber equipped with a sulfuric acid quench.\n\nThe site Prevention Program is managed by the Plant Engineer and the Environmental Engineer and includes:\n\n1.)  Employee Participation\nEmployees are encouraged to participate in site prevention programs to promote awareness and to allow input from all site personnel into managing the safety of our facility and personnel.  Specific means of employee participatin in process safety and accident prevention are outlined in the Employee Participatin procedure in the site PSM manual.\n\n2.)  Process Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information including piping and instrument diagrams, flow diagrams, material safety data sheets, technical data sheets, relief device calculatins, equipment files for design specifications, etc. is maintained and readily accessible to all employees.  The PSI used for the initial PHA's and subsequent revalidations is listed with that particular PHA and includes pointers to the location of each piece of information.\n\n3.)  Process Hazard Analysis\nInitial Process Hazard Analyses for all parts of our process were performed and are documented with appropriate reports.  Revalidations of these PHA's are being performed according to the OSHA PSM five-year schedule.  The findings of the PHA's, appropriate risk mitigation improvements, and responsible personnel are compiled into a spreadsheet which is used by the Project Engineer to track the mitigation to completion.\n\n4.)  Operating Procedures\nDocument-controlled standard operating procedures and manufacturing procedures are readily available to the process operator to ensure safe and consistent operation of the process.  These procedures are annually reviewed and certified as being currently accurate and correct.\n\n5.)  Training\nA training program administers and tracks all requisite training which includes OSHA-mandated operator process training and refresher, emergency response to spills, releases, fires, and explosions, and hazard awareness and control.  Training documentation and verification of understanding are kept in the central files.  Personnel records are also maintained and tracked electronically via the \"TrainingMine\" program.\n\n6.)  Contractors\nContractors are selected based on their safety record and performance as documented on the required pre-qualification form.  Site orientation training on the hazards present and the safety and emergency proccedures is administered to each contract employee before work on-site is allowed.  A post-project evaluation of the firm's safety performance is completed by site personnel to document adherence to site policies and procedures and safe work practices.\n\n7.)  Pre-startup Safety Review\nPre-startup Safety Reviews of all equipment alterations are conducted to ensure hazards uncovered during the PHA phase of the project are corrected and that the equipment is ready for safe use.\n\n8.)  Mechanical Integrity\nA comprehensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance program is in place to monitor equipment integrity and performance and to ensure operation of all safety systems.\n\n9.)  Safe Work\nSafe Work, Hot Work, Lock Out/Tag Out and Confined Space Entry permit programs are used to safeguard personnel and prevent accidents and incidents during maintenance activities.\n\n10.)  Management of Change\nA procedure to manage all changes to equipment and facilities is used to ensure the hazards of the modification are mitigated and all personnel are informed of the alterations.  The procedure and the appropriate forms can be found in the site procedures manual.\n\n11.)  Incident Investigation\nThe site utilizes an incident, near miss and suggestion reporting database with whole site access to report safety, environmental, process and quality incidents and near miss incidents and to suggest improvements in any of these categories.  This database and accompanying procedure, provide for review and investigation by staff members, suggestion of corrective actions, tracking of completion of these actions and communication to appropriate personnel of incidents and steps taken to prevent recurrence.\n\n12.)  Compliance Audits\nSite personnel conduct audits of the facilities and systems to ensure potential hazards are detected and corrected and that site systems are functioning appropriately to prevent mishap.  In addition to the requisite compliance audits of the process safety and accident prevention systems, perfunctory audits are conducted on parts of these programs such as safe work permitting systems and inspection records.  However, only the compliance audits are officially documented and kept on file for review.",

The last RMP was submitted June 21, 2004.\n\nAt the Nalco Freeport Plant, we are committed to operating and to maintaining our process in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, we have established a Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Managemet Program (the RMP rule).  One element of the RMP rule is a Risk Managemet Plan (RMPlan) which details accident prevention measures and safeguards.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk managemt program.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs are vital to ensure the safety of our employees, the community and the environment.  The Nalco Freeport Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances we use.  In the event of a significant accidental release, trained responders will act to control and contain the release.  We work with local emergency response organizations to evaluate potential releases and to formulate appropriate responses to contain and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of such a release.  Nalco in conjunction with the local emergency planning and response organizations, has established a means to warn the surrounding communities in the event of a release which would threaten the public.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nNalco operates a manufacturing facility at the Freeport site in Brazoria County, Texas.  This batch-process facility produces a wide variety of mater"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, this facility has experienced one (1) accidental release.  This accidental release resulted in one (1) employee being directly exposed to a chemical.  There were no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or off-site, or any evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  Work in the plant was stopped and employees were notified to proceed upwind of the release.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nOur facility maintains an emergency response and contingency plan, which meets all of the federal, state and local regulatory requirements and is communicated to all employees.  This plan and the emergency response training for the site personnel provide protection for our employees, the public and the environment.\n\nRepresentatives of our facility are active members of Brazosport's Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) group, the Brazoria County Petrochemical Council (BCPC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Brazospo"

These drills are based on scenarios of fires, explosions and/or toxic releases and may involve any or all of the above response organizations.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following improvements were identified during Process Hazard Analysis at our facility:\n\nImprovements already completed include:\n\n1.)  Review of relief systems for adequacy and change as necessary to handle worst emergency case.\n2.)  Addition of more alarms and reviews of set points of existing alarms for adequacy.\n3.)  Addition of more instrumentation to better monitor process conditions at more points along the process train.\n4.)  Installation of back-flow prevention measures to avert hazardous contamination or mixing of incompatible chemicals.\n5.)  Revision of standard operation procedures to clarify process steps and to eliminate possible confusion or error.\n6.)  Established a mechanical integrity and preventin maintenance program to monitor critical equipment and instrumentation and to minimize unforseen failures.\n7.)  Installation of vent flare to incinerate all vent gases and minimize hazardous material release during an emergency venting situation.\n8.)  Updated all plant drawings to reflect equipment and piping changes to provide an accurate tool for site personnel.\n9.)  Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analyses have been compleeted to meet the five year revalidation frequency per OSHA.\n10.)  Implementation of Safety Instrumented Systems program.\n11.)  Increase employee awareness through additional training.\n\nPlanned improvem"
