Action items that are identified from inspections, incidents, process hazards analyses, etc. are provided to employees for review.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nAll site personnel have access to the companyA?s electronic mail system and Intranet.  Chemical-specific information (Material Safety Data Sheets), operating information, and information on the equipment in the process are easily accessible.  The information resides in a controlled electronic system that is updated regularly.  All Process Safety Information (PSI) is verified at each scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\nEvery five years, process hazards analyses (PHAA?s) are conducted in each process.  The HazOp method is used to conduct PHAA?s.  Findings are identified, prioritized and then promptly corrected.  The information is shared with personnel who are impacted by the findings.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic system.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nOperating procedures that address normal and abnormal operating situations are in place.  Deviations from established operating limits and the consequences of these deviations are clearly identified and easily referenced.   The procedures are reviewed annually to assure accuracy.\n\nTraining:\nTraining on these operating procedures is ongoing to assure that operators know and understand the safe operation of their unit and that they understand the necessary actions for abnormal situations.  Employee training is documented and tracked through a network system.  The system allows specific training needs to be identified as well as tracks the completion of required modules. \n\nContractor Safety:\nControl of contractor activity in operating areas is well established.  A safety steering committee and safety council actively monitors the actions of contractors to assure their safety. Contract employees are required to participate ann"

Findings are addressed prior to startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nMechanical integrity procedures are in place to ensure that maintenance workers understand how to perform their duties safely to maintain the facility.  Specific instructions for testing and inspections are included.  Testing and inspections are conducted as scheduled and documented.  Maintenance and engineering follow established codes, standards and company guidelines.\n\nHot Work and Control of Abnormal Activities:\nControl of hot work and abnormal situations is conducted to ensure that work does not contribute to or cause hazardous results.  All aspects of hot work and abnormal situations are controlled.\n\nManagement of Change:\nThe proper management of change generates appropriate assessment of possible impacts on the level of safety and health on an area.  All impacted documents and procedures are altered as required.  Appropriate personnel are informed regarding changes before they operate the new system.\n\nIncident Investigations:\nIncidents, injuries and near-miss situations are investigated.  Root causes are identified and documented.  Changes in the system are made to prevent recurrence.  Incident reports are readily available to assist other areas in preventing similar occurrences.  \n\nCompliance Audits:\nA site-wide compliance audit is conducted every three years of the PSM-RMP program.  Deficiencies are documented and corrected in a timely manner.  Open action items are tracked through completion.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Programs \n\nAt the Baytown Industrial Park, accident prevention programs are required in each process.

Appropriate personal protection equipment is readily available.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Lanxess Baytown plant has an exceptional record of accident prevention and release containment.  There have been no RMP-defined accidents with either onsite or offsite injury or damage in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nLanxess Baytown participates and is covered by the Bayer Baytown Industrial Park emergency response system. Bayer Baytown maintains a trained emergency response team on site at all times.  Each shift has an emergency response team with up-to-date training.  There are emergency medical technicians on each shift and an ambulance and fire truck staged for their immediate use.  An auxiliary trailer has additional equipment (air bottles, escape equipment, etc.) for immediate access during emergencies.\n\nThe emergency team includes members who have completed requirements for hazard materials (HazMat) response. Equipment for emergency HazMat use has been prepared for this facility.  \n\nThere is a designated organization that responds during daytime emergencies and off-shift emergencies.  The Incident Command Center (ICC) has equipment (maps, warning systems, P&ID drawings, MSDS, etc.) and supplies to direct the response.  The ICC is equipped with an emergency response modeling system to estimate the potential effects of a release on other areas of the facility or the community.  The ICC maintains lists of personnel to notify during an emergency.
