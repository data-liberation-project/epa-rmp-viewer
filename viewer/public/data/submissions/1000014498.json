Lesaffre underlines its commitment to the environment, focusing on the limitation of nuisance and the prevention of ecological risks. This policy has made it possible for the Group to acquire a level of expertise recognized internationally. It has guided research and targeted investments, reinforcing its will to improve the quality of life for everyone: employees, clients, consumers and area around its production sites.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: The Lesaffre Yeast Corporation facility in Headland, Alabama manufactures yeast for sale to the baking and brewing industries and retail consumers. The yeast manufacturing process utilizes aqua ammonia, an RMP-regulated substance. The approximately 30% aqua ammonia solution is used as a nutrient in the yeast manufacturing process. \n\nCHEMICAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  The facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing management, training, operating procedures and maintenance systems in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for aqua ammonia as part of the RMP requirements.  The facility has implemented a Program 2 Prevention Program for aqua ammonia.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental releases from the aqua ammonia process at the facility. The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, process hazard reviews, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP revisions and updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.  \n  \nFIV"
