Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe City of Jackson Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The WWTP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to its facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe City of Jackson WWTP Chlorination/Dechlorination Station has been installed to disinfect treated wastewater.  The station includes treatment plan offices, a chlorination/dechlorination room, a chemical storage area, instrument rooms and additional miscellaneous treatment basins.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are the regulated substances.  The amount of chlorine connected to the manifold system are two one-ton cylinders with one empty or reserve cylinder.  The amount of sulfur dioxide connected to the manifold system is 1 one-ton cylinder.  There are a maximum of 3 one-ton cylinders of chlorine and 2 one-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide in the area.\n\n3.  Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chemical release scenarios, identified as ?worst case release? and alternative scenario?.   Scenarios were conducted for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that ?the owner or operator shall assume the?maximum quantity in the largest vessel?is released as gas over 10 minutes,? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario?.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determin"
