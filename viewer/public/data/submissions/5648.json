This shall be achieved through the application of proper safeguards to processes, equipment, methods and procedures, and by providing employees with the training necessary to perform their jobs safely.\n\nOSRAM Sylvania takes safety very seriously.  Our top priority is the well-being of our employees, our neighbors and the community.  We started practicing incident prevention long before the RMP regulations came into effect.  We use a variety of safety equipment and procedures to prevent releases.  As part of our prevention program, we conduct Process Hazard Reviews to ensure our operations are designed to minimize health, safety and environmental impacts.  Other important aspects of our prevention program include various chemical storage containment structures, operating procedures, training, maintenance and inspections, incident investigation, and compliance audits.\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nOSRAM Sylvania is located on 12 acres of land on Broad Street in Central Falls.  We have been in the community for almost 90 years and currently employ over 500 full-time employees.\n\nThe 600,000 square foot facility houses both a lime glass furnace and a borosilicate glass furnace.  This gives the plant the capacity to produce lime glass for incandescent light bulbs and fluorescent glass tubing, as well as borosilicate glass for high intensity discharge lamps.  The Plant also produces such non-lighting accessories as glass domes for anniversary clocks, chimneys for oil lamps, giftware, glass shades, floral vases, and candle lamps.  \n\nThe Central Falls facility is one of the most diverse glass plants in the world and also one of the few remaining manufacturers in the U.S. that still design and install their own proprietary manufacturing eq"

Products from the Central Falls plant are shipped to broad-ranging markets all over the world with customers primarily in the lighting, floral, and giftware industries.  Currently, 70% hydrofluoric acid is the only substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68).\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by the regulations, the worst case release scenario involves the release of the largest quantity of hydrofluoric acid contained in a single vessel.  Dispersion modeling of the vapors released from the liquid pool was conducted using the WAKE computer model to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.  Based on this analysis, it is anticipated that such a release would result in potential off-site consequences.   \n\nIn the alternative release scenario, the tank's contents are released within the containment berm surrounding the vessel.  Modeling was again conducted using the WAKE computer model and the meteorological conditions allowed under EPA's Off Site Consequence Analysis Guidance for alternative release scenarios.  Based on this analysis, it is anticipated that such a release would result in potential off-site consequences.   \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of hydrofluoric acid from the facility in the past five years that resulted in any off-site consequences.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nOSRAM believes in being well prepared for emergencies.  Over the years, we have established a strong and proven Emergency Response Program at our facility.  Our emergency response program includes:\n\n7 A fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team that includes certified Hazardous Materials Technicians.\n7 Coordination and training with local emergency responders, including the Central Falls Fire Department.\n7 Active participation on the District 4 Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n7 A comprehensive emergency response plan for all chemical and fire emergencies including coordination with professi"
