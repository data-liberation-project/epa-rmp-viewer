THE FACILITY POLICY: The owners, managers, and employees of Trenton Cooperative Equity Exchange are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the materials.\n               Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire                               Department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for Response                 to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment?\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION: The primary activity at the facility as the storage for sale to farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 78000 pounds in the facility?s storage tank.\n3.    THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  The facility complies with the            rules and Regulations relating to the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solution, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29CFR 1910.111  regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n4.    THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on sit nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n5.
