      "SummaryText": "\nEmployees at Craig Supply Co are encouraged to use utmost care in handling anhydrous ammonia and other chemicals.  Safety equipment is provided for all employees and they are encouraged daily to use it.   Valves, hoses, and all other handling equipment are to be inspected daily.  Management is to be contacted immediately if there is a problem with any equipment.  Safety meetings are held to review safety procedures and employees are expected to follow them.  No one is permitted to use transfering equipment unless they are properly trained and wear safety equipment.\n\nIf there is an accidental release of a reportable quantity, employees are to contact management immediately so that proper authorities and response personel can be contacted.  If there is a major release, Craig Supply Co employees will not respond, because we do not have the proper personal protective equipment to handle a major release.  Holt County LEPC has training sessions so that personel responding to such an incident are properly trained on how to handle such a situation.\n\nCraig Supply Co is a retail business for agricultural products.  We sell chemicals, seed, lipuid and dry fertilizer, and anhdrous ammonia for a nitragin source for corn production.  We also provide custom application of fertilizer and chemicals.\n\nIn our worst case scenario we have described what would take place if one of our two 30,000 gallon storage tanks would rupture and all of its contents would be released in ten minutes.  Our tanks are never to be filled over 80%, so there would not be more than 115,000 pounds of material released.  There would be an offsite impact of about 1.59 miles in a radius of our plant.  Approximately 324 people would need to be evacuated from this 1.59 mile radius.  This is less than our original RMP because we have moved our plant out of the city limits.\n\nIn our alternative scenario we have described what would be a more realistic situation that would happen if a hose would rupture.  Excess flow"

      "SummaryText": " devices are in place, so if this takes place they will automaticly shut off anf stop the flow.  If this would take place, considering the size hose we use and the pressure in the tank, no more than 1800 pounds of product would be released.  There would be an offsite impact of approximately .47 mile in radius of our plant.  Approximately 155 people would need to be evacuated from this .47 mile radius.  \n\nWe purchased the anhrdrous ammonia plant in September of 1995.  Since that time there has not been an accidental release or reportable accident to date.\n\nPreventive maintenance is a continual process.  Hoses and valves are checked daily for wear and replaced as needed.  All hoses have the date stamped on them when they are to be taken out of service.  Lines are also checked for leaks or possible failures.\n\nIn the future we will continue to stress training and use of safety measures."
