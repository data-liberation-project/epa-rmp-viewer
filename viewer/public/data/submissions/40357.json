All releases are assumed to take place at ground level for the worst-case and alternate case scenarios.\n\n\n\nAt JCI-Greenfield, the worst-case scenario is identified to be the release of the largest tank of TDI.

All chemical storage tanks are located indoors, above ground with secondary containment.  Tanks critical to the process have level sensors to prevent any tank from being overfilled.  Fill duration is also monitored during the transfer of TDI to the process lines and if not satisfied within a set time period, auto filling ceases and an alarm is activated.  Chemical wet systems are equipped with high and low-pressure switches to shut down in the event of a line rupture.  Critical valves are monitored electronically as to open/closed positioning.\n\n\n\nJCI-Greenfield has a preventative maintenance software program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant's day to day operations.

In the event of a release, the HazMat Team will respond using appropriate actions, as described in the Environmental Spill Contingency Plan, in association with the local fire department and Clean Harbors Environmental Services Companies.\n\n\n\nJCI-Greenfield has established a spill response team (HazMat Team) and has assigned specific duties and responsibilities to specific individuals, like the spill Incident Commander, who have been selected and trained to respond to in-house chemical releases.  If necessary, the appropriate outside facilities, such as the hospital or nearby residences and businesses, will be notified.  Employees are and will be trained in the safe handling and management of hazardous materials, respiratory protection, confined space entry, transportation of dangerous goods, and in the emergency response procedures to be taken in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nAll spills that take place at the Greenfield facility must be documented and reported to the appropriate personnel.  The reporting allows the number and type of spills that occur to be tracked.  This in turn allows measures to be implemented to prevent similar spills from occurring in the future.  Spills exceeding the reportable quantity must be reported to certain regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nIf a release of 10 gallons or more of TDI has occurred, JCI informs Bayer Corporation, the supplier of TDI, of the accidental release and inquires about assistance and advice.\n\n\n\n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nJCI-Greenfield is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of its operation, including safety.  As such, JCI-Greenfield strives to take a proactive approach to ensure employee safety, health and wellness and to protect the environment.\n\n\n\nJCI-Greenfield conducts "

These inspections and audits may be conducted by internal personnel from various levels of the organization (line employee to plant manager), by JCI personnel from other locations, or by outside consultants.  Results of the inspections and audits are documented and communicated, and action plans are developed to correct noted deficiencies.\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was recently performed at the Greenfield facility.  Recommendations from that PHA are being implemented which will improve the safety of the TDI process, as well as reduce the likelihood and magnitude of any TDI spill.\n\n\n\n"
