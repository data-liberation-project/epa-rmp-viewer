      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nAES Puerto Rico is a cogeneration power plant under construction in the town of Guayama, PR.  The plant will supply approximately 454 MWs of electricity to the local utility, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and also provide pressurized steam to a neighboring petrochemical facility owned by Phillips Puerto Rico Core, Inc (Phillips).  Commercial Operation is currently scheduled for mid August 2002.\n\nThe facility is located on an 85-acre tract of land owned by AES Puerto Rico.  The facility also occupies associated rights of ways for transmission lines, conveyors, make-up water supply lines, process steam piping and roads.  To the south of the facility is an area of wetlands, the Las Mareas Harbor and the Caribbean Sea.  To the east is the Phillips petrochemical facility.  To the north and northeast are a vacant lot, State Road #3, Baxter Pharmaceuticals and Chemsource.  Directly west is a vacant lot with wetlands.\n\nThe facility consists of two boiler and steam turbine units, a wet cooling tower, water treatment, coal, limestone and ash handling systems.  The boilers are coal fired Circulating Fluidized Bed boilers with NOx, SOx and particulate matter air emissions control equipment.  Coal will be delivered by ocean vessel to a new docking facility at the Las Mareas Harbor.  Limestone will also be delivered by ocean vessel or by over the road truck.  All other plant consumables such as #2 fuel oil, propane, chlorine, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide and urea will be delivered by truck.\n\nIt is the desire of the management of the AES Puerto Rico project to build and operate the plant in compliance with all applicable environmental and safety regulations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being submitted as part of the facilities preparations for commissioning and start-up activities that will include the introduction, use and storage of up to 6,600 pounds of chlorine.  #2 fuel oil and propane will also be stored on site above threshold quantit"

This manual contains the procedures and plans currently in use by the construction workforce.  This manual satisfies the requirements for the implementation of an RMP.  Prior to commercial operation and turnover of the facility, AES Puerto Rico will implement the written programs necessary to provide a continued compliance with the RMP regulations.\n\nThe facilities chemical accident prevention plan is focused on training and preventive maintenance.  The initial operations team has been indoctrinated on corporate culture and the required OSHA training.  The contractor constructing the plant provided operator training on overall plant knowledge.  In addition certain equipment vendors provided system specific training.  For future operator "

      "SummaryText": "training, the facility people are preparing on a qualifications programs that will include certification of new employees prior to assignment to operating areas. \n\nPreventive and corrective maintenance will be scheduled, tracked and implemented through the use of a maintenance management software program.  The initial schedules for preventive maintenance are being developed according to manufacturer recommendations, American Petroleum Institute guidelines and good engineering practice.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe chlorine storage capacity is based on a maximum of three 2,000-pound cylinders and four 150-pound cylinders of chlorine gas for a total storage capacity of 6,600-pounds.  The worst case and alternate release scenarios are based on the plan to valve in and use only one cylinder at a time for each of the 2,000 and 150 pound cylinders.  Also the swapping out of empty and full cylinders will be done only one at a time.  EPA?s RMP Comp modeling software was used to determine the distance to endpoint for both scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario has the potential to affect people offsite to within a 3-mile radius of the chlorine storage are.  Located within this area is the municipality of Guayama.  The affected areas are the neighborhoods of Puente Jobos, Pozuelo and the Guayama Urban Zone.  Besides the industrial facilities neighboring the AES Puerto Rico facility, numerous residences, four schools, a hospital and the Guayama Correctional Facility could be impacted. \n\nThe alternative release scenario has the potential to affect an area within a radius of up to 0.2-miles from the release point.  This scenario would only affect people at the AES Puerto Rico, Phillips and Chemsource facilities.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAs a new facility there have been no accidents involving the chlorine systems at AES Puerto Rico."
