The same properties that make these materials valuable as blowing agents in our manufacturing processes also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling them. These precautions are in place to prevent the unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the health of our employees, and to reduce the threat to members of the nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle isobutane, isopentane and ethane. This combined with the safety devices inherent in the design, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our employees helps insure the safety of our employees and of the surrounding community. Our emergency response program is meant to comply with the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Law (Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Act). FP International's response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\n2) Stationary source and regulated substance handled\n\nA) At our Hopkinsville facility, FP International uses polyethylene and polystyrene in manufacturing our products. In the processes to make foamed polyethylene or foamed polystyrene, isobutane, isopentane and/or ethane blowing agents are injected into the polymer melt during the extrusion processes. Two 14,193-gallon above-ground storage tanks are used to separately store isobutane and isopentane and two 5,000-gallon storage trailers are used to store ethane. \n\nB) The regulated substances handled at this facility are isobutane, isopentane and ethane.\n\nC) The maximum amount of these materials stored at this facility is 150,000 pounds. \n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "te release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario\n\n(RMP Comp used for modeling.)\n\nA) Worst Case Scenario:\nA failure of the 14,193-gallon above-ground isobutane storage tank when filled to its operating limit would release 56,520 pounds of isobutane. Per NFPA policy we limit the maximum filling capacity of each tank to 85% at 60 degrees F. In this scenario it is assumed that the entire contents would be released as vapor which would find an ignition source and result in a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the end point of 1 psi for the worst case scenario would be 0.3 miles.\n\nB) Alternative Scenario: \nA pull away causing failure of a 25' length hose on the 14,193-gallon above ground isobutane storage tank would release 1,410 pounds of isobutane. The manually operated shut off valve will stop the flow of isobutane. Although it is unlikely, if the vapor reached an ignition source it would result in a vapor cloud fire.  The estimated distance required for the vapor to disperse below the lower flammability limit would be < 0.1 miles.\n\n\n4) General accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThis manufacturing facility complies with the EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and with all applicable State Codes and Regulations. This facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58 and NFPA -30.  As part of our Corporate Injury Illness and Prevention Plan all employees receive training covering the following aspects of health and safety; safety philosophy, general safety rules, reporting safety hazards, emergency procedures and hazardous communications. In addition to the training received upon employment, further training is given if any employee is exposed to a hazard previously unrecognized, or if any employee is reassigned to a job which exposes them to new hazards. Our Corporate Hazard Communication Plan, which is located in our safety manual, contains safe work practice"
