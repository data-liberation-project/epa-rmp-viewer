This plant utilizes holding ponds, digester, and a clarifier in cleaning wastewater for ultimate discharge into the Yazoo River.  The plant currently has an emergency repsonse plan prepared by Mr. Terry Ricks and employees receive periodic safety training and procedures for responding to an emergency release.  At any one time there can be as many as six - 2,000 lb. steel cylinders containing chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment pocess to purify the effluent before discharge.  Chlorine in the cylinder is compressed to a liquid state and when discharged through a regulator into the effluent stream becomes gas and is absorbed into the water sterilization.  The CAS# for chlorine is 7782-50-6.  The regulated level for chlorine Is 2,500 lbs.; therefore this facility must have a risk management plan.   In the worse case release scenario chlorine, which is heavier than air could have a harmful affect on residents.  Since this plant functions on a twenty-four hour basis the worse case scenario is considered to be contact with two tanks releasing a total of 4,000 lbs. of chlorine instantaneously.  In this case, an immediate evacuation downwind would be required, this procedure is addressed in the emergency response plan.  The facility is surrounded by a six-foot high levy to protect against flooding.  This levy would act to contain the chlorine in the facility unless a significant wind wa"

Terrain in the area is extremely flat, therefore any chlorine release would tend to spread and reduce the thickness of the layer.  There are no ravines or pockets in the area where chlorine gas may concentrate.\n\nThis facility implements an accident release prevention program.  This program includes safety training and operating procedures to respond to any release.  Handling cylinders so that no full cylinder will be moved over another full cylinder, therefore greatly minimizing the worse case scenario of two cylinders impacting with both rupturing.  Also the lift height for chlorine filled clinders is reduced to less than a foot, further minimizing the chance of a release.  The alternate release scenario of a minor release (1-2 lbs.), when changing valves on cylinders, can be controlled by using a ventilation system and automatic shut off valves will eliminate down stream releases from system leaks.\n\nThe five year accident history shows no releases occurred during this period.\n\nThe emergency response program utilizes the plan Re-Act Team working with the Fire Department and the City Emergency Management Coordinator to establish a command post to treat a major incident.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety consist of the following:  Frequent replacement of the gas supply lines to the effluent, the more logical and safe procedure for handling chlorine filled cylinders and the availability of SCBA should the operator be required to close a cylinder valve in an alternative release scenario."
