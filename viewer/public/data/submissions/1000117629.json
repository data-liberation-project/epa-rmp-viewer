Release prevention and risk management procedures that are consistently applied at the facility are discussed in the RMP resubmittal documentation. \nShield\u0092s Management Team has a demonstrated commitment to maintaining compliance with both OSHA PSM and EPA RMP Programs, which includes the assurance that personnel are trained and capable of following its SOPs in completing their duties onsite.  The General Manager creates and certifies a list of the trained and certified personnel that are knowledgeable and fully capable of carrying out the duties and responsibilities specified in Shield\u0092s SOPs.  This list is maintained and updated as needed when personnel are added or removed during the year and recertified and revised at least annually. SOPs are also updated when required by management of changes during the year, and at least annually reviewed and revised as necessary to retain their currency to reflect up-to-date operations and safety as they pertain to plant processes for both manufacturing and maintenance.  \nIn the event of an accidental release, Shield has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which includes coordination with local emergency responders from the Dudley and Webster Fire Departments. Shield personnel are trained to perform emergency shut-down procedures to stop or control a release, if it is safe to do so.

(Shield) is a contract manufacturer and packager of consumer and commercial products. Shield manufacturing operations have been located at its 50 Oxford Avenue facility in Dudley, Massachusetts facility, since 1982. A Site Location Map is included in the RMP.  The facility is engaged in the business of compounding, blending, and packaging aerosol and liquid consumer products for, household and automotive/industrial applications. Approximately 45 full-time employees work at the Facility. Emergency contact information for this Facility is included in the Emergency Action Plan. All products made by Shield are made for its unaffiliated commercial customers. Shield does not sell or market anything it produces directly to retailers or public consumers.  \nShield blends ingredients to customer specifications, and packages the mixtures in consumer quantity packages \u0096 both aerosol (spray products) and non-aerosol products. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR \u00a768) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR \u00a71910.119) apply to batch processing at the facility including the filling and warehousing of the finished aerosol products (boxed and palletized). Shield currently has four aerosol propellants that are held in quantities greater than 10,000 pounds, in four above ground storage tanks (AST). The quantities exceed the EPA RMP and OSHA PSM threshold quantities. Propellants are stored as liquefied gas under pressure in designated tanks that were made and are maintained by Shield specifically for th"

The processes regulated under the Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management programs include the storage of those propellants, the \u0093charging\u0094 of aerosol cans with propellant, and the temporary storage of filled aerosol cans.\nThe propellants are delivered to the Facility by carefully selected vendors with nationally recognized safety programs. The tanker truck is off-loaded by trained personnel to the designated tank. The Tank numbers, overall tank sizes and contents of the four RMP above ground storage tanks are as follows:\n\u0095\tTank LPG#17- 30,000-gallon total volume\n\u0095\tTank LPG#18- 30,000-gallon total volume\n\u0095\tTank LPG#16- 6,000-gallon total volume\n\u0095\tTank LPG#15- 6,000-gallon total volume\n\n3.\tShield\u0092s accidental release prevention program and Program 3 prevention elements \nShield Packaging Company Inc.

Based on this business model, the facility carries very little additional inventory of raw materials, including propellants, above the needs to meet near-term customer order-based batch operations.  As that relates to the Aerosol propellants, by policy, training and oversite, all four (4) of propellant storage tanks, which are equipped with specially designed pressure relief valves, are never filled beyond the 80% of capacity level. When comparing a tank's \"total volume\" to its \"fill capacity,\" the key difference is the safety factor that Shield (and the entire aerosol packaging industry) applies. Meaning that the \"fill capacity\" limit (? 80%) used by Shield is always less than the total tank volume. A portion of the tank is intentionally left empty to account for potential expansion or other safety concerns, like temperature fluctuations. The facility also holds very little inventory of finished goods as we strive to make and ship to meet customer needs with the least amount of holding finished products in storage prior to shipping.  Since Shield\u0092s batch operations consists of only one process train, operated in a batch mode, every element of Shield\u0092s prevention program, as described and managed through our RMP Program Procedures, apply to our RMP covered process and RMP regulated substances. \n4.\tShield\u0092s Five-year accident history \nShield has had no reportable releases of RMP regulated chemicals at the facility over the past 5 years. \n5.\tShield\u0092s Emergency Response Program\nIn the event of an accid"

      "SummaryText": "ental release, Shield has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which includes coordination with local emergency responders from the Dudley and Webster Fire Departments. Shield personnel are trained to perform emergency shut-down procedures to stop or control a release, if it is safe to do so. These procedures include roles and responsibilities, emergency procedures, facility emergency equipment, communications in the event of an emergency as well as emergency shutdown of RMP governed equipment and processes.  The EAP includes conducting emergency drills for both onsite and off-site responders at least annually to ensure that our employees and local responders are familiar with Shield\u0092s EAP and how to respond in case of emergencies and potential fires.\n6.\tShield\u0092s planned changes to improve safety\nThe most recent process hazard analysis (PHA), conducted in January of 2024, was a Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP).  Through this very thorough structured systematic review of its operations and risks, the Shield HAZOP Team identified recommendations and findings to improve process safety, and the PHA team categorized corrective operational and mechanical integrity issues as low, medium, or high priority. High priority improvements will be performed before lower priority issues.  Shield uses a system to track all recommendations and findings from our PHAs and audits to closure and completion.\nShield\u0092s Management Team has a demonstrated commitment to maintaining compliance with both OSHA PSM and EPA RMP Programs which includes the assurance that personnel are trained and capable of following its SOPs in completing their duties onsite.  The General Manager creates and certifies a list of the trained and certified personnel that are knowledgeable and fully capable of carrying out the duties and responsibilities specified in Shield\u0092s SOPs.  This list is maintained and updated as needed when personnel are added or removed during the year and recertified and revised at"

      "SummaryText": "least annually. SOPs are also updated when required by management of changes during the year, and at least annually reviewed and revised as necessary to retain their currency to reflect up-to-date operations and safety as they pertain to plant processes for both manufacturing and maintenance.  \nThis RMP Resubmission provides the most recent \"review or revision\" of Shield\u0092s Program 3 prevention program elements, as required by 40 CFR \u00a7 68.190(b).  As Shield resubmits this RMP (based on the 5-year resubmission requirement), we are certifying that we have fully updated all nine sections of our RMP program based on our recently conducted RMP Program audit and Process Hazard Analysis (HAZOP) results and our ongoing continuous improvement commitment to process safety management and risk management programs.  Shield continues to integrate our RMP program and procedures to fully support our commitment to our continued safe operations of the Shield Packaging facility. \n\nNOTE:  When completing this RMP Re-submittal Shield adjusted our regulated substances list in Section 1.17.c. as follows:\n\nAdded butane (CAS # 106-97-8) as a portion of the AB-70 mixture.\n\nThere was no area to include notes or footnotes in that section of the RMP Re-submittal, so we are choosing to include this note and information here."
