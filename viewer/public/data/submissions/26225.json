      "SummaryText": "3387 LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Ferro Corporation, Baton Rouge Site (Ferro) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of  processes.  The company's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances and should, in spite of all precautions, a  release does occur, respond to control and contain the release with the plant's trained personnel.\n\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFerro manufactures, processes and stores specialty chemicals in Zachary, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana.  The facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded threshold quantities.  Based on process knowledge, Ferro identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The facility uses six regulated substances in five separate processes.  The chemicals and largest quantity on site (either as largest quantity in a single process or total quantity of mixtures) are: acetaldehyde (37,000 lbs); ethyl chloride (74,000 lbs); formaldehyde (120,000 lbs); methyl chloride (220,000 lbs); 2-methylpropene(40,000 lbs); and phosphorus tricloride (88,000 lbs).\n\nThe Baton Rouge Site is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard  and is classified under a listed SIC Code (2869) with, the five processes identified being classified as Program 3 processes under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nFlammable Substances:      The endpoint for the worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 pound per square inch (psi) over pressure (i.e., 15.7 psia) for vapor cloud explosions.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables as"

The greatest distance to the 1 psi over pressure endpoint for the worst-case release of 2-methylpropene was determined to be  0.27 miles based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) April 1999; Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\nToxic Substances:       Each of the three regulated toxic substances at the Baton Rouge Site was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to endpoint.  Based on the USEPA Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, a worst-case release of methyl chloride could result in a distance to the toxic endpoint of 2.7 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence line.  Conditions considered for alternative release scenarios are: a  release rate dependent upon scenario; use of typical meteorological conditions at the site; the actual release height; and consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\nFlammable Substances:     A single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP Program. The hypothetical release scenario  identified for 2-methylpropene was failure of a loading line resulting in release of the entire contents of a tank trailer without mitiagtion and with the material vaporizing and igniting in a vapor cloud explosion.   The distance to the 1 psi over pressure endpoint for the alternative-case release of 2-methylpropene, using the USEPA Guidance, was 0.13 miles.\n\nToxic Substances:    One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for the regulated toxic substances at Ferro to determine the distance to an endpoint for each.   B"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Baton Rouge Site primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.   To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Ferro periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  \n\nOperating Procedures:    The Baton Rouge Site maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by rev"

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.   In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\nContractors:    Ferro uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Baton Rouge Site evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs):   Ferro conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information for all covered processes.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review "

Basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.   Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).   Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Ferro incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nHot Work Permits and Other Safe Work Practices:    Ferro has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

Training of  personnel in safety procedures helps ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change:     The Baton Rouge Site has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system addresses changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes to assure that these changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  \n\nIncident Investigation:    Ferro promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or similar incidents.  \n\nCompliance Audits:     To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Ferro periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
