KFDC's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EH&S Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nKFDC produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.     \n\n\n\nThe ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at KFDC in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity. The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the protective performance standards adopted by KFDC.

Part of this program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n- A blast-resistant building to house the control room, maintenance personnel, and administrative offices.  The building may also be used by KFDC as an emergency shelter as needed.\n\n- Minimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\n\n- Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\n\n- Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\n\n- Locating emergency shutdown buttons at the loading areas that can be activated in case of an ammonia release.\n\n- Reducing the risk of overfilling by having level alarms on storage tanks and bullets.\n\n- Providing an interlock system, which will shutdown ammonia loading pumps upon high pressure during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia due to overpressurization.\n\n- DCS/SIS with Abandon Loop Sequence to safely shut down the plant in an upset situation.\n\n- A neutralizer deluge system to help prevent releases from the UAN plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Five-Year Accident History\n\n    \n\n    No incident resulting in onsite in"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be, the Kansas Highway Patrol, the Western Plains Medical Complex, Southern Star, and Victory Electric.  The KFDC Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.
