IVOL completed a large-scale construction revamp of the asset and began production 2018. The site has a long-standing pledge to operate in a manner that is safe for workers, the public and the environment. IVOL has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at the Westlake facility. This responsibility will continue to be exhibited by putting resources into assets for accident prevention. Example of this includes training the workforce and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to execute sensible controls to forestall predictable releases of hazardous substances. Nonetheless, if a release occurs, our trained workforce will respond to, control and contain the release.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nIVOL is situated at 4300 Hwy 108, Westlake, Louisiana 70669. The site makes ethylene as a primary product and several other byproducts. The site contains 1 toxic regulated chemical and 22 regulated flammable chemicals. The toxic chemical is anhydrous ammonia. The flammable chemicals are Acetylene, 1,3-Butadiene, Butane, 1-Butene, Butene, 2-Butene-cis, 2-Butene-trans, Ethane, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isopentane, Methane, 1,3-Pentadiene, Pentane, 1-Pentene, 2-Pentene, (E)-, Propadiene, Propane, Propylene, Propyne, and Vinyl Acetylene.\nNot all of these chemicals are handled individually at concentrations above their threshold quantity.

Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated as a part of the management of change process.\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nIVOL performs pre-startup safety reviews when an addition or a modification to the facility is made and the MOC evaluation designates a PSSR is required.  The pre-startup safety review confirms, prior to the introduction of chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\nCompliance Audits\nIVOL performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its Process Safety Management Program.  A team comprised of employees from the Corporate PSM department and other Indorama facilities, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques and process safety experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed, and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\nIncident Investigation\nIVOL promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards thes"
