The intent of this plan is to facilitate the prompt evacuation of employees when necessary and to account for all personnel.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is properly functioning, Energy Transfer periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

Equipment examples include vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, and relief and vent systems with associated emergency shutdown systems and controls (i.e., monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks).\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) a review of the process hazards, and (3) the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to ensure that the employees can perform the job tasks in a safe and satisfactory manner.  Process equipment inspection and testing follows recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Equipment deficiencies that are outside of acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to ensure safe operation.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change \r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer has a comprehensive system to manage and document changes to all covered processes. A systematic approach is followed to control and manage facility changes in order to minimize the possibility that such changes will have an adverse impact on personnel safety, equipment, or the environment.  Employees involved in process operations and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks might be affected by process changes are informed of and trained in the change prior to process start-up.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss"

Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  Energy Transfer provides Hot Work Permit training to all plant employees. Copies of issued work permits are maintained in Operations and Maintenance for a period of 1 year following completion of work.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovations, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job, (2) follow the safety rules of the location including the safe work practices, (3) advise the plant of any unique hazards presented by the contractor, and (4) notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in the process areas.  \r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

This technique provides a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design. Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  Energy Transfer assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.   The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Dubberly Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.

      "SummaryText": "DUBBERLY GAS PLANT RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  Energy Transfer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOUCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer operates the Dubberly Gas Plant located in Webster Parish, Louisiana.  This facility is a natural gas processing plant which uses mechanical refrigeration to remove liquids from the gas stream.  Glycol dehydration is used to remove water from the stream.  Mixed liquids from the refrigeration plant are stored in atmospheric tanks prior to being shipped off-site in tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, the Dubberly Gas Plant is a Program 3 process.  Inlet gas is compressed from 600 psig to 950 psig using 3 inlet compressors.  The gas will be treated by an amine unit to remove CO2 and then dehydrated using a combination of a TEG and molecular sieve units.  It will then be turbo expanded to reduce the pressure from 950 psig to 285 psig.  This expansion will allow non-methane hydrocarbons to condense out.  The liquids will exit the plant via pipeline.  The residue methane gas will be compressed to 1000 psig utilizing (3) residue compressors and shipped via pipeline.   \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThis facility has not had any accidental releases.\r\n\r\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\r\n\r\nThe Dubberly Gas Plant has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRA"
