      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Farmers Supply are committed to prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:\n\n7 The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n7 Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. \n\n7 The maximum quantity stored on site would be 131,250 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n7 The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 131,250 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The worst case release would result in material leaving facility\u0012s property. \n \n7 The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose which might result in a release of 11,908 pounds.  The alternative case release would result in material leaving facility\u0012s property. \n.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n \n* have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;"
