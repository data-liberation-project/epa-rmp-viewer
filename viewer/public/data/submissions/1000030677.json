Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.   We are also coordinated with the City of Erlanger Fire Department and the Kenton County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility is primarily used for warehouse storage and distribution of ice cream products and for the production of ice.  The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration systems is approximately 24,200 pounds.  Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n3.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies so that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses are What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are reevaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nIt is acknowledged that a PHA for this facility is overdue due to administrative oversight. United Dairy Farmers views the oversight seriously as is evidenced by the timely completion at all of the other covered facilities and a PHA for this facility will be conducted no later than (NLT) sixty (60) days from the date of this submission.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, United Dairy Farmers, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc.  has a comprehensive training program"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at United Dairy Farmers, Inc. to manage changes in ammonia systems technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia systems modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-start up safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system, or any of its components, are opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
