There have been no such accidents to report since the aqueous ammonia treatment systems were installed at new plant site in January 2003.  Should an accident occur, this RMP must be updated within 6 months of the incident. \n\nF.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility:\n\n1. First call 911 on an internal/land line phone for the Victorville Fire Department and police department.  The Victorville Fire Department can also be reached at (760) 955-5227 and the Victorville Police Department at (760) 241-2911. \n\n2. Immediately contact either the Plant Engineer (Tony Penna), Operations Manager (Andy Stephens), Maintenance Manager (Ed Lesh), or General Manager (Dave Boward).\n\n3. Call the Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES) Warning Center 1-800-852-7550.\n\n4. If additional help is required for an aqueous ammonia spill or leak, the facility can call Asbury Environmental Services (800) 590-4229.\n\n5. If an aqueous ammonia release exceeds 1000 pounds or 135 gallons, call the National Response Center 1-800-424-8802 [24 hours, 7 days].\n\n6. If serious injuries or harmful exposures to workers occur, call the nearest Cal-OSHA Office at (909) 383-4321.\n\n7. If an employee ingests aqueous ammonia, the Poison Control Center can be reached 24 hours per day at 1-800-342-9293.\n\n8. Notify the local CalARP regulatory agency: Victorville Fire Department, Hazardous Materials Division at (760) 955-5229.\n\n9. Call for assistance with chemical cleanup.

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year in conjunction with the Emergency Business Plan for the Victorville Fire Department.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nThe High Desert Power Plant has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Victorville Fire Department.  In the case of an aqueous ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of the High Desert Power Plant to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).  The High Desert Power Plant also plans to contract with a private company to respond to any hazardous materials spills.\n\nB.STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe High Desert Power Plant is located at 19000 Perimeter Road in Victorville, California.  The facility is situated northwest of Interstate 15 off the D Street exit.  The immediate area is primarily industrial and rural.  The location for storing aqueous ammonia is in the southerly side of the property.  Ammonia sensors provide an alarm status to the control room which is manned 24 hours per day.  The High Desert Power Plant is a 750 MW unit that will be placed in commercial operation in May 2003.  The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system scheduled completion date is in January 2003.  The facility uses 25% aqueous ammonia to catalytically reduce boiler flue gas nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to elemental nitrogen and uses 19% aqueous ammonia to control the pH level of the condensate.\n\n25% aqueous ammonia is used as a catalyst in the SCR system to assist in controlling the NOx emissions from the stack.

Much of the safety of the process is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the process.  For example, the High Desert Power Plant operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The CalARP Program included detailed hazard review to identify potential release scenarios, an analysis of the potential consequences associated with select release scenarios and a detailed seismic inspection of the aqueous ammonia process equipment.  In addition to the technical studies, the CalARP Program incorporated preventive programs such as detailed operating and maintenance procedures, incident investigation, training, auditing, and emergency response activities.  Finally, the aqueous ammonia processes are inspected by operators every two hours.\n25% Aqueous Ammonia\n\nThe High Desert Power Plant maintains tight control of its aqueous ammonia system through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of aqueous ammonia, there are three mechanisms at the facility to minimize the impact:  1) a containment berm surrounding the aqueous ammonia tank sized to hold the entire contents of the tank, 2) an underground storage tank to contain any spills during the unloading process, and 3) both the storage tank and the underground containment tank are double-walled.  There are level controls on the storage tank to alert the operator to extreme"

      "SummaryText": "NOTE:  An original RMP submission was previously provided to all the relevant agencies.  In accordance with the revised requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule under Clean Air Act section 112(r), this RMP for the High Desert Power Project (HDPP) has been revised to include the following :\n\n\u00bf Included requirement to add information on reportable chemical accidents to the RMP within six months of the date of the accident;\n\u00bf Incorporated requirement to report changes to emergency contact information within one month;\n\u00bf Removal of the offsite consequence analysis (OCA) description from the RMP executive summary;\n\u00bf Added e-mail address for the emergency contact;\n\u00bf Included the purpose and type of any submission that revises or otherwise affects previously filed RMPs; and\n\u00bf Included the name, address, and telephone number of the contractor who prepared the RMP.\n\n\nA.ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nPOLICIES\n\nThe High Desert Power Plant employees conduct ongoing inspections, testing, and replacement of the critical items in the aqueous ammonia systems.  The aqueous ammonia systems are monitored during (at least) daily rounds by a High Desert Power Plant employee.  Typically, the High Desert Power Plant operators perform cursory facility inspections twice per shift, or six times per day.  Once identified, the High Desert Power Plant will fix or outsource any system deviation that is noted.  In any case, a record of the maintenance or work performed on the system is maintained by the Plant Supervisor.\n\nThe High Desert Power Plant has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Response Program section of the CalARP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provi"
