They involve \"what if\" scenarios where employee teams investigate every possible scenario of a new project and resolve it as part of the design phase of the project.\n\n*Hazard reviews are also conducted at the terminal.\n\n*Emergency response, including employee responders, as well as off-site responders like LEPC, State Police and HAZMAT, add another layer of protection to the community.\n\n*We work closely with the police and fire departments, and we conduct routine drills.\n\n*In the event of an emergency, we are prepared to respond.\n\nHAT has not had any accidental releases, as defined by the Risk Management Program regulations, for the last 5 years.  The releases that HAT has had in the past 5 years are typically very small releases in nature to the air and do not meet the criteria that is stipulated in the regulations.\n\nHAT has an extensive emergency response program both within the facility and within the community.  Within the facility there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control, and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with.  The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance.

The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that each person is required to have depending on their responsibilities.  Furthermore, the plan commits the management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nAlthough HAT's ERP is specifically written for the HAT facility, the plan is also part of the countywide emergency response plan organized with the local LEPC.  All these plans are reviewed with representatives of the LEPC, State Police, Sheriff's Department, Fire Departments, regulatory agencies and industry.\n\nHAT is striving on a daily basis to make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  HAT literally has safety and/or environmental training going on almost daily.  Every employee and contractor will attend numerous safety and/or environmental training meetings annually.  HAT and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety and the environment and our success is accomplished by research, innovation and the use of good common sense."
