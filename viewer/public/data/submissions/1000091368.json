The storage and handling system consists of (2) 18,000 and (1) 30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized  facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 673,919 pounds; this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of Title 9 Illinois Administrative Code Part 215: Anhydrous Ammonia, Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities, based upon the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA'S) \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" (6th Edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\", and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
