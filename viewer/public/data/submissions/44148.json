The manufacturing processes include the full spectrum from raw ingredients handling and processing to the shipping of finished products ready for the consumer.  Processing that is done at this facility includes milk receiving, milk pasteurization and evaporation, chocolate processing, chocolate products moulding, packaging, storage, and rail/truck shipping.  The regulated substance for this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for cooling of fluid in a separate utility building for the purpose of providing cooling capabilities to various stages of the manufacturing operation.  The anhydrous ammonia process has a total system capacity of approximately 22,200 pounds.\n\nThe Hershey Company training programs go beyond standard mandated training.  Training programs currently being conducted range from general safety and environmental awareness for all employees to comprehensive, program specific training sessions for target groups based on job requirements.  Training, which is conducted in classrooms and on-the-job is documented and employees are often evaluated through a competency testing program.  Written programs have been implemented which include specific action to be taken by facility employees as well as emergency response personnel in the event of an emergency or accident in the facility.  Written operating procedures for operating and maintenance personnel have been implemented for anhydrous ammonia systems inspection and maintenance.  In addition, adherence to formal preventive maintenance programs and testing parameters for anhydrous ammonia systems is monitored and documented.  A Chemical Review Committee reviews and approves all new chemicals prior to introduction at the facility.  The committee provides recommendations on training, safety and equipment needed for safe chemical storage, handling"
