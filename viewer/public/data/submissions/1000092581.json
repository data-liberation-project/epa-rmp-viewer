      "SummaryText": "m distances are used to determine the radii for circles around the covered processes. Residential populations within these circles are required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this RMP submittal. These estimates were acquired from the EPA Marplot software. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to an individual release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not taken into account. Generally, the Sparks Plant components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance with regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nThe plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide program documentation includes the following PSM elements: process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; mechanical integrity; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; and emergency planning and response. Throughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, toxic gas sensors, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards. Infrastructure security improvements at designated areas in the plant have been implemented that provide layers of protection against deliberate man-made incidents in accordance with applicable elements of U.S. Department of Homeland Security's CFATS Risk Based Performance Standards."

To ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint. The alternative release scenario is a release that is considered more reasonable or more likely. These maximu"

Compliance with all expectations set forth in the EHSS Charter will help develop the EHSS culture and ensure Carus operates with the highest standards of safely and environmental awareness. These expectations are a key part of job performance assessments. Thatcher Group will not tolerate failure to live up to the expectations outlined in this charter; as such failure could negatively impact the health and safety of our employees, our community, and the environment. In addition to EPA's RMP rule, the Sparks plant complies with State and Federal OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's State and Federal Hazardous Waste Generator, DHS's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard and DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nIn this RMP submission, there is one Worst-case toxic release scenario and one Alternative Case toxic release scenario evaluated at the Sparks plant for each of the two toxic gases; chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Section 2 of this RMP submittal contains additional details regarding the Worst-case release scenario while Section 3 contains additional details for the Alternative Case release scenario. The Hazard Prediction and Analysis Capability (HPAC) model was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). These HPAC models has been approved by the Chlorine Institute and is published in their Pamphlet 74 Edition 6 and was used to develop the worst-case and alternative scenarios for all chlorine releases and to determine the greatest distances to the chlorine toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.\r\n\r\nFor chlorine, the Worst-case toxic release scenario has been determined to be the largest container which results in the longest release distance, which is a 1-ton cylinder, known as a tonner, releasing 2,000 pounds with a maximum distance to a 3 ppm end point of 0.14 mile.
