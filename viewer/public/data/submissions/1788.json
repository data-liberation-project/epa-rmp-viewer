Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at American Fertilizer Company, Inc. in Pueblo are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Pueblo County Rural Fire Department,\nwhich provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 10,000-gallon tank and in two 5,000-gallon interconnected tanks  at our\nfacility in Pueblo (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 17,000 gallons (87,482 pounds) at the\nmaximum fill capacity of 85 %.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the largest \n anhydrous ammonia storage tank (43,741 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum distance\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 3.2 miles (Figure 2).  The"

The\nscenario involves the release of 7616.42  pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 25.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAmerican Fertilizer Co. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\nhazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nAmerican Fertilizer Co. maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our\ncovered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nAmerican Fertilizer Co. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\nwho are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\nprocesses.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAmerican Fertilizer Co. conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\nproper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at American Fertilizer Co. to manage changes in process chemicals,\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nAmerican Fertilizer Co. routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\nequipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nAmerican Fertilizer Co. conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the\nplan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance\nissue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAmerican Fertilizer Co. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is\na team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning\naccident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access\nto all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly\ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5.
