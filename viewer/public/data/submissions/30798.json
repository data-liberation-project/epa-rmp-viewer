      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\nThe Cardinal Plant is a coal-fired electric utility.  The plant is operated by American Electric Power and is located in Brilliant, Ohio.  The plant operates under a Title V operating permit issued by the Ohio EPA in 2002.  Two chlorine processes are the only processes utilizing a regulated chemical above the RMP threshold quantity at the facility.  Both process are used for chlorination of the circulating water systems with one process being located at Unit 1-2 and the other process being located in a separate area for Unit 3.\n\nTo prevent an accidental release of chlorine, the plant uses a safety system that incorporates employee training, system reviews and inspections, as well as a facility wide emergency response plan.  This system has produced a process that operates in a safe and efficient manner with no accidents over the past five years.  Evaluation of potential safety improvement is an ongoing process and safety improvements are made as necessary.\n\nThe plan addresses the procedures to be used in the event of an accidental spill.  The plant has a trained HAZMAT team that can respond to a spill 24 hours a day.  The plan also includes phone numbers for contacting outside resources to help contain a spill if necessary.  Employees are provided annual refresher training that reviews emergency action plans, spill prevention and response, as well as emergency contacts.  Employees who work with the chlorine systems are provided more in depth training.  Any changes to the system will be investigated through a Process Hazard Analysis prior to being made to ensure the changes do not impact the safety of the system.\n\nThe plan will be managed by the Safety & Health Supervisor and Plant Environmental Coordinator and is overseen by the Plant Manager.  The plan will be periodically reviewed to ensure all sections are current."
