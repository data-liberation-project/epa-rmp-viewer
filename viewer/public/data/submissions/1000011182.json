The Facility Policy.\nThe owners, management, and employees of AG Grain, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 55000 gallons in our two storage tanks.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is 21miles.\nb.  The alternative release scenario would be a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .1 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History.\na.  There have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property dmage at the facility; nor\nto our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place"

The emergency response program.\nThe facility has:\na.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n \n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
