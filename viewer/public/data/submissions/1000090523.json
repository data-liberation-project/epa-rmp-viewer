We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n* An overview of our emergency response program\r\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Oneonta Terminal located in Otsego County, New York is owned by Enterprise Terminals and Storage, LLC and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\r\n\r\nThe Oneonta Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane.  The propane is received from an underground propane pipeline and is stored in an above ground storage tank.  The stored propane is transferred from the storage bullet tank into highway transport trucks for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the truck filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection.\r\n\r\nThe Oneonta Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded"

We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Oneonta Terminal.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Oneonta Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Natural Gasoline Degassing Unit.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe O"

      "SummaryText": "emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Oneonta Terminal is coordinated with the Otsego County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Oneonta Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Oneonta Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Oneonta Terminal.\r\n\r\n* Foamglas fireproof insulation will be installed on the mercaptan tank."
