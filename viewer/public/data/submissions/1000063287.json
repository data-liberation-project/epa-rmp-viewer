There have been no accidents that meet the reporting requirements for this resubmittal. This has been determined based upon the results of interviews with Suncor employees and a review of safety and environmental records covering the five year period prior to the submission date of the RMP.\u000b \u000b\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\u000b \u000b\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental release prevention program elements in place at the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery and describes the systems that have been implemented to help prevent accidents.\u000b \u000b\r\n\r\nManagement Commitment\u000b \u000b\r\n\r\nSEUSA's Commerce City Refinery management recognizes the value of active, widespread employee participation in the effective application of process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention for the risk management program (RMP).\u000b \u000b\r\n\r\nEffective process safety management depends upon the knowledge and contribution of eve"

Refinery employees have been and will continue to be involved with implementing process safety management and accidental release prevention.\u000b \u000b\r\n\r\nThe refinery management team members understand their role, which includes the commitment of resources to implement site PSM and RMP policies and procedures and to sustain and continually improve safety.\u000b \u000b\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\u000b \u000b\r\n\r\nThere is a written employee participation plan that describes how employees participate in the development and implementation of PSM and the RMP accidental release prevention program. It also describes how employees have access to the information they need to do their jobs safely. Employees participate in updating and compiling procedures, conducting inspections and tests on equipment, participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams, and playing active roles in management of change, pre-start-up-safety reviews, contractor evaluations, compliance audits, incident investigations, and sequential safety meetings. This intensive and wide spread involvement by all employees is considered essential to the effectiveness and sustainability of the accident prevention program.\r\n \u000b \r\nThe refinery supports Joint Health and Safety and Process Safety Employee Committees to involve employees at all levels of the organization in addressing both personnel safety and process safety issues. As a result of the utilization of these committees, employee consultation is integrated into the development and implementation of all elements of PSM and the accident prevention program requirements of RMP.\r\n \r\nProcess Safety Information\u000b \u000b\r\n\r\nAs part of compliance with PSM and RMP, the refinery maintains current information about the chemicals, technology, and equipment associated with the process. Safety Data Sheets are available to provide specific information about exposure hazards and emergency response/treatment considerations."

The technology information includes the process chemistry, intended inventories, safe upper and lower limits for such items as temperatures, pressures, flows or compositions, and the consequences of deviation from the limits. The refinery maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, procedures, and protective instrument systems, such as automated shutdown systems.\u000b \u000b\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and design codes and standards. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to help ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\u00a0\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe process hazards analysis is a systematic approach to help ensure that hazards associated with the various production units in the process are identified, evaluated, and controlled.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \r\n\u000b\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\u000b\r\nFor each production unit, the SEUSA Commerce City Refinery has implemented and maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are routinely reviewed through usage or training, and there is a separate process to review and annually certify that the procedures are current and accurate. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the control rooms and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\u000b\r\nTraining for Operators\r\n\u000b\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, there is a formal training program in place.

This includes classification, investigation and mitigation of risks and hazards identified by the investigation. The refinery employs an incident coordinator to oversee the incident management program and all incidents are reviewed by management. This includes reviewing incidents that may need to be investigated to comply with the requirements of PSM and RMP. This helps ensure that all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury are promptly investigated. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. Investigations are conducted by a team of management, represented and contract employees (if a contractor was involved). The team produces a written report that includes finding, recommendations and learnings that are reviewed with management. Corrective actions are entered into the management system and tracked until completion. Investigation reports are available to all refinery employees.
