The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response,and Compliance Audits. Equipment associated with this covered process includes three 30,000-gallon stationary storage tanks, ancillary pumps, piping, and valves. From the stationary storage tanks, the anhydrous ammonia is either transferred to the 10-34-0 fertilizer manufacturing process, or to nurse tanks. The Huntington Facility is responsible for the transfer of anhydrous ammonia and for the operations of the stationary pipe reactor in accordance with the PSM/RMPr.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia may be transported to the Facility by a 9,000-gallon commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck (Vendor) Operator will transfer the anhydrous ammonia from its tanker truck to the storage tanks. The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation. At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify\n\nthat it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its vendor for review and a copy of its PSM/RMPr Document upon request.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Helena Chemical Company (Helena) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations in Huntington, IN.  At this Facility, Helena engages in the formulation, distribution and sale (wholesale)of chemicals to other Helena Wholesale and Retail Operations to support local agricultural operations.  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Huntington Facility located approximately 1.75 miles east-northeast of Huntington at 104 Beaty Drive, Huntington, IN 46750.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Huntington Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Huntington Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena recently acquired this property to construct a new wholesale Facility.  Based on certain operations that are planned to be conducted, Helena will operate this Facility as an RMP Program 3.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 RMP Facility have been completed.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Huntington, IN Facility operates agricultural chemical manufacturing and distribution equipment at its Wholesale Facility and transfers agriculture chemical products to other Helena Wholesale and Retail operations.  The Huntington Facility intends to operate the following three covered processes:    \n\n\n\nCovered Process 1: Railcar Storage.  This process is prospective in t"

      "SummaryText": "hat the facility does not plan to bring railcars of anhydrous ammonia onto the facility when it begins operations; however, this process may be performed in the future based on the demand for 10-34-0 fertilizer.  If this process is performed, anhydrous ammonia will be stored in up to three 34,000-gallon railcars that are disconnected from their primary means of locomotion at the facility for brief periods of time.  Anhydrous ammonia that is stored in the railcars will be transferred to the 10-34-0 manufacturing process.  The railcars are owned by the anhydrous ammonia vendors or the railroad and are maintained at an off-site location. However, if or when a railcar with anhydrous ammonia is parked on the Facility rail spur, trained HCC personnel (Process Operators) will be responsible for receiving and inspecting the railcar in accordance with the PSM/RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nCovered Process 2:  10-34-0 Reacting.  The facility will manufacture liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer (i.e. 10-34-0 Fertilizer) using a Stationary Pipe Reactor (SPR).  The ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer is manufactured by blending anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid in the SPR.  The resulting ammonium polyphosphate solution is blended with water and discharged to a \"wet well\" and through a cooling process.  The anhydrous ammonia may be stored in either: stationary storage tank(s); commercial truck(s); or railcar(s). Trained Process Operators operate and maintain the SPR in accordance with the PSM/RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nCovered Process 3: Storage and Handling.  Anhydrous ammonia is primarily off-loaded from 9,000-gallon commercial tanker trucks and into a 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The Facility currently has only one 30,000-gallon storage tank but plans to construct up to two more 30,000-gallon storage tanks at a future date.  The transfer operations from the tanker truck to the storage tank(s) is conducted by the commercial truck operator "

      "SummaryText": "(Contractor/Vendor).  Once in the storage tank, Operations personnel manage the anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia is then transferred to either the 10-34-0 Reacting process or to nurse tanks.  (This Facility does not own or operate nurse tanks.  However, other Helena Chemical Company retail operations that are located close to Huntington, IN transport their nurse tanks to the Huntington, IN Facility, fill the nurse tanks, and sell the anhydrous ammonia in the nurse tank to the end user [e.g. Farmer].)  The transfer of anhydrous ammonia to the 10-34-0 manufacturing process will be conducted by Facility Process Operators.  The transfer of anhydrous ammonia to nurse tanks will be conducted by Facility Process Operators or Process Operators from other Helena Facilities that own and operate the nurse tanks.  The storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia will be conducted in accordance with the PSM/RMPr accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for each covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  For covered processes 1 and 2, the largest vessel would be a 34,000-gallon railcar.  For Process 3, the largest vessel would be a 30,000-gallon storage tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes that a vapor valve is not fully closed after a transfer process.  The alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for Covered Processes 2 and 3 assumes a rupture of a 3-inch transfer line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of these types"
