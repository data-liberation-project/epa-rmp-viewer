      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nWastewater Treatment Plant\nAlbertville, AL  35950\n\n\nDear Sir: \n\nWe are a small wastewater treatment plant in north Alabama.  We use chlorine for disinfecting of the effluent and sulfur dioxide to remove the chlorine.  We have reduced our inventory of sulfur dioxide below the reportable threshold amount.  Our inventory of chorine is 6000 lbs., 4000 lbs. on line, 2000 lbs. on stand-by, and 0 lbs. in inventory.\n    We have had a written Emergency Response Program since 1997.  Our ERP is part of Marshall County LEPC.  We also have a Standard Operating Procedure written for all personnel.  Our SOP contains a section on chemical safety and actions to take if an accident occurs.\n    The treatment facility has several aids in assisting if a gas leak ever happens.  We have auto shut off on the chlorine feed system.  If a pipe bursts or has a small leak, we have chlorine gas detection sensors.  On the sensors, we have local and remote alarms.  Installed at our office is an outside audible alarm that we manually turn on if we need to notify surrounding people.  We also have windsocks to direct the Emergency Response people upwind if a problem occurs.  Albertville Fire Department is our Emergency Response Team.  The ERT are hazardous emergency trained and equipped.  \n    \nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n    A total release of 2000 lbs. of chlorine gas in 10min. Would have an offsite impact of 0.9 miles (RMP*Comp).  The 1990 U.S. Census Bureau estimated our population is 1500 people.  Because our storage and delivery system are inside a building, the leak detection sensors are in this building, and the plant is manned 24 hours a day 7 days a week the offsite impact would be less.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO\n    A release of 200 lbs. of chlorine gas in 10min. Because of pipe leak would have an offsite impact of 0.2 miles.  The 1990 U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population to be 70 people.  As for the same reasons as stated in the worst case scenario plus auto shut off of the feed system"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 45289,
      "SummaryText": " because of loss of vacuum the offsite impact would be less.\n\n    As far as the five-year accident history, we have not had any accidental releases of chlorine gas in eleven (17) years of kept records.  In lieu of the RMP and our \"in house\" safety regulations we will strive to remain accident free.  \n    If an accident occurs the emergency response would be, call 911 to notify the fire department that we have a chlorine emergency.  We have trained with the fire department on the worst case and alternative case scenarios.  We would assist the fire department by notifying the LEPC, shut off power as needed, and assist in any other non-hazardous operations as needed.  They would enter buildings, notify public, and handle evacuations.\nWe feel that our completion of the Risk Management Plan has enhanced our knowledge of safe chemical handling practices, which will help ensure the safety of the public and personnel.\n\nCharles Rogers\nPlant Manager\nMunicipal Utilities Board\nP.O. Box 130\nAlbertville, AL  35950"
