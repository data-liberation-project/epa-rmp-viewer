Lange,  Agronomy Branch Manager\n\n       RISK  MANAGEMENT  PLAN -  EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY-\n\n   1.     The   NH3  (Anhydrous Ammonia)   Facility  Policy;\n\n       - The owners,  management, operators and employees of LaSalle Farmers Grain Company (LSFG)\nare committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental\nrelease should occur,  the facility is prepared to work with Madelia Vol. Fire Dept. and /or other authorities\nto mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to  people and the environment.\n\n\n   2.    Facility Information;\n\n       -The Primary activity at the facility is the storage , transfer and Application  of fertilizers (specifically\nof concern ...Anhydrous Ammonial)  for sale to  farmers.\n\n       -Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored , applied or distributed for / as a Crop Production Nutrient.\n\n       -the maximum quantity stored could be as high as 126,000 # in our single 30000 gal storage\n tank, and 90000# in our Twenty-Six 1000 gal , and 24360# in our Four 1450 gal Nurse Tanks.\n\n       -The maximum quantity handled would be the loading of 1450 gal Nurse Tank holding 6090# or the\nunloading of a 9500 gal transport holding 26000#.\n\n  3.   The Worst-Case Release scenerio and the Alternative Release scenerio.\n\n        a.  The  WORST-CASE release scenerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.   The  maximum quantity released would be 126000#, which represents the Total volume of the storage tank at 85  percent of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is  .89 miles ..\n\n        b.  The ALTERNATIVE release scenerio based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely\npotential incident) is a release from a rupture in a 2\" transfer "
