Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Helena Chemical Company in Osmond are strongly committed to employee, public, and\r\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\r\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\r\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\r\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\r\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Osmond Fire Department, which\r\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in 18,000- and 12,000-gallon tanks at our facility in Osmond (Figure 1).  The\r\nmaximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWe utilized RMP Calc for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\r\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the 18,000\r\ngallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank (80,000 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.\r\nAt Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance\r\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 1.5 miles (Figure 2).

The\r\nscenario involves the release of 12,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 2\r\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\r\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.7 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.7-mile radius of the\r\nfacility is 600.\r\n\r\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\r\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nHelena Chemical Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\r\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\r\n(Appendix D).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\r\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nHelena Chemical Company maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within\r\nour covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation;\r\nthe information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\r\n(Appendix B).\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nHelena Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\r\nwho are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nHelena Chemical Company conducts"

Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\r\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\r\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\r\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Helena Chemical Company to manage changes in process\r\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\r\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\r\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nHelena Chemical Company routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes\r\nand modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\r\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\r\nto placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nHelena Chemical Company conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the\r\nplan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.
