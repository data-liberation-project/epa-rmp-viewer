The liquefied propane is offloaded from tractor trailers [one (1) off-load station located on-site approximately 175 feet from the vessel] and stored in the above pressurized vessel for eventual delivery into a 12 inch underground pipeline through use of a fixed piping system, one (1) pump (300 horsepower, single flow, double seal), and associated appurtenances. The system is designed to minimally meet the requirements of NFPA #58 (2014) for siting and safety/control functions.",

(Sunoco Logistics) Delmont Terminal in Delmont, Pennsylvania, we are committed to providing a safe work environment for employees and to being a responsible corporate citizen. We believe that excellent performance in the areas of health, environment, safety and security goes hand-in-hand with operational excellence and financial success. In fulfilling this commitment, we will comply with regulatory requirements and provide and maintain a safe working environment using acceptable and proven business practices. All Sunoco Logistics employees will strive to identify and eliminate hazards which could result in injury and illness, damage to the environment, property damage, and security losses.\n\n\n\nThe Delmont Terminal is operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which we operate. We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This summary provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed and implemented.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Delmont Terminal is an onshore, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, No. 2 fuel oil, propane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated"

The following accident prevention programs are in place at the Delmont Terminal:\n\n\n\n1) Employee Participation\n\n2) Process Safety Information\n\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\n4) Standard Operating Procedures\n\n5) EHS Operator Training\n\n6) Contractors\n\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n\n9) Work Permits\n\n10) Management of Change\n\n11) EHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation\n\n12) Emergency Response\n\n13) Compliance Audits\n\n14) Trade Secrets\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nOffsite consequence analysis was performed to estimate the potential for an unexpected release of Propane that could affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative case release scenarios. Sunoco Logistics has submitted these release scenarios to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Delmont Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The terminal keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. This is a \"new\" propane blending process; consequently, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nResponse actions are coordinated with the Slickville Volunteer Fire Department and Westmoreland County LEPC (Westmoreland Department of Public Safety). A Facility Response Plan (FRP) is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\n\n\nThe Delmont Terminal maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and SARA"
