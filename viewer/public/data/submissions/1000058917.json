The health and safety program includes chemical hazards.  This program is a top priority for Prairie State.  Success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all.\n\n\n\nPrairie State provides information to employees about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal communication channels such as supervisor-employee meetings, bulletin board postings, memos or other written communications. It is the responsibility of all employees to develop proper safety work attitudes and adhere to all safety rules, be aware of potential worksite hazards, and to be informed and trained about safety issues.\n\n\n\nPrairie State employees receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers potential safety and health hazards, safe work place practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards. These are provided to increase awareness and allow employees to function within a safe working environment.  Employees shall not perform work where known chemical hazards exist unless they have received training to safely perform those job functions.\n\n\n\nA safety committee composed of hourly employees, supervisors, managers and other representatives from throughout the organization will be established to help monitor the Company's safety program, to address accident preventability, and to facilitate effective communications between employees and management about workplace safety and health issues.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPrairie State Generating Station maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the selective catalytic reduction air pollution con"

Personnel receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia systems are visually inspected on a daily basis.  Standard operating procedures for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the ammonia storage system are in place. The procedures are written and posted in appropriate areas.  Personnel are trained annually on safety concerns, general operation procedures and emergency procedures. \n\n\n\nAmmonia sensors and alarms are in place to detect an anhydrous ammonia release.  A water deluge control system serves as the primary means of mitigating an airborne anhydrous ammonia release around the storage tanks. \n\n\n\nPrairie State performed process hazard assessments using a 'What If' type analysis for the anhydrous ammonia system.  This analysis utilizes a brainstorming approach, in which a team of people familiar with the process asks questions about possible undesirable events.  The What If analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and recommendations for risk reduction.  Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no ammonia releases during the past five years that are reportable under the Five-year Accident History. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nPrairie State's emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia involves trained employees on-site and public responders dispatched by 911 and Prairie State.  For minor events, trained Prairie State personnel will perform repairs and administer first aid.  For larger events, Prairie State will contact 911, profess"
