Our paper mill in North Charleston manufactures unbleached paper used to make decorative laminates for surfaces like kitchen countertops and office furniture.  Our high-strength paperboard is also used in the manufacture of a variety of familiar food containers and drink cartons.  In addition, MeadWestvaco's lumber mill produces framing lumber and construction timbers.\nEfficient use of all resources is a trademark of MeadWestvaco operations.  Natural by-products of the papermaking process are the raw materials for specialty chemical products manufactured by MeadWestvaco at its North Charleston Specialty Chemical Division facilities. These specialty chemical products are used in the manufacture of a variety of goods like rubber and plastics, soaps, asphalt, textile dyes and printing inks.\nMeadWestvaco emphasizes product and service differentiation.  As part of the company?s strategy, we are also unequivocally committed to total compliance with environmental, safety and health regulations.\nMeadWestvaco and Chlorine\nMeadWestvaco uses chlorine in 90-ton rail cars to treat water before it is used in the papermaking process.  Prior to use, the chlorine rail cars are staged on a separate track referred to as the Haz-Mat track.\n\nAt low concentrations chlorine is commonly used to make solvents, disinfectants and chlorine bleach cleaners.\nExposure to chlorine can cause irritation of the eyes, nose and throat.  Exposure to extremely high levels can damage the lungs and cause a buildup of fluid which can be life-threatening.\nProtection of the health and safety of our employees and residents of our communities is our highest priority.  When we handle chlorine, we make every effort to safeguard people and the environment.  Multiple safeguards are in place to ensure that we handle chlorine safe"
