These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  In addition, the plant manager maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Site has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Site uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Noble Energy, Inc. Zif Gas Plant (Site) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of its processes.  The Site's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, Site personnel are trained to respond, control, and contain the release.\n\nIn addition, the facility has conducted informational safety meetings for members of the general public located within a one-mile radius of the plant and a half-mile radius of the Department of Transportation (DOT) pipeline and public responders from the surrounding area.  The safety program implemented by the facility also included a mass mailing of safety information brochures to the surrounding community.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Site is located approximately seven miles south of Clay City in Wayne County, Illinois.  The plant operates a variety of processes to refine field gas into various natural gas products.  The regulated substances handled at the facility include natural gas liquids such as propane, butane, pentane, and hexanes; condensate from natural gas; hydrogen sulfide; sulfur dioxide; ethyl mercaptan; carbon dioxide; diethanolamine; and lubricating oils.\n\nAPPLICABILITY\n\nBased on the definitions provided in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 68 (40 CFR 68), the Site operates one process that consists of the entire plant piping network, process vessels, and product storage.  \n\nBased on volume estimates and substance concentrations, the following substances exceed the reporting threshold as defined in 40 CFR 68.130:  Propane and the BG Mix (which consists of Butane, Iso-Butane, Pentane, Iso-Pen"

Based on guidance from EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (March 2009), Butane was chosen as the representative flammable substance from the BG Mix since it was the predominant regulated flammable component of the mixture.  As such, the flammable substances included in this Risk Management Program (RMP) are Propane and Butane.  Toxic substances handled at the Site do not exceed reporting thresholds and are therefore not included in this RMP.\n\nThe Site is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, the Site is considered part of Program 3 under 40 CFR 68.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nSince processes at the Site that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the Site OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Site encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Site and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Site has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to review plant operating procedures and participate in the evaluation of process safety hazards associated with the operation of the gas plant.

During these training sessions, employee feedback will be obtained as to the evaluation and prevention of process safety hazards. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe plant manager maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the plant processes.  These technical documents address chemical properties and associated hazards; limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories; equipment design; and basis process flow configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan is in place that addresses employee participation, and process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  The gas plant is equipped to ensure that the production and refining process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe plant manager also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction; design pressure and temperature ratings; and electrical ratings of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised."

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Site primarily uses a What If/Checklist methodology to perform these evaluations.  The What If/Checklist analysis is recognized as a systematic hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant manager periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. \n\nThese periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the  process is no longer operating.
