THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE WOULD BE 4420 POUNDS IN A 1,000 GALLON NURSE TANK. *NOTE: MAXIMUM QUANTITY ALLOWED TO BE STORED IS 85% OF NURSE TANK SIZE. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PRODUCT ON SITE WOULD BE 53,000 POUNDS IN TWELVE 1,000 GALLON NURSE TANKS.\n\nIII. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n   A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A NURSE TANK OVER A 10 MINUTE TIME SPAN. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 4,420 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE TOXIC ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.31 MILES. \n\n   B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DIST"
