      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy in place at are facility is:  The facility complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Ken Nading who is employed by West Bend Elevator.  Ken will then decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.  Ayrshire is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  This would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 3.6 miles.  There is an estimated 349 individuals within this radius.  Residences, recreation areas and major commercial, office, or industrial areas are also within the radius.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia plants is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with regulations and state law.  We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Ayrshire Fire Dept and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Palo Alto County Disaster Coordinator and Ayrshire Fire Dept Chief and members.  The Ayrshire Fire Dept has inspected our NH3 facility.  We have no plans at this time to improve or change our plans.  We review our plans annually or sooner if necessary."
