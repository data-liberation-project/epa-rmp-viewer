The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Akron Services, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 56000 pounds in one storage tank, however the worst case scenario reflects the loss of the storage tank and two nurse tanks simultaneously.                                                                                                                                                                   3. The worst-case scenario would be the relese of the entire contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 52,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.\n\n4.  The accidental release priogram: The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Containers, and Storage Facilities.  These relations administereesd by the IL Dept of Ag. are consistant with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The five-year Accident History:  To our knowledge, there have been no accidental releases of ammonia for the covered processes in the past five years which have caused on or off-site death, injury, evacuation, property or environmental"

The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency action is highly dependent on the local fire department for response and coordination.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic avalutions are performed to assess  the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  At this time, no additional specific safety recommendations are necessary."
