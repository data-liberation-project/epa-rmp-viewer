This regulation is published in 40 CFR Part 68. We have assessed and continue to assess how accidental releases may occur, and how the public and the environment might be impacted. After reading this program, you may consider making recommendations for improvements to the Health, Safety, and Environmental Manager.\nIndChem, Inc. is a distributor of industrial chemicals. We store three substances that are regulated by the above Act at or above threshold quantities; chlorine, hydrofluoric acid, and sulfur dioxide. Chlorine is a pungent  greenish yellow gas or amber color in liquid form. The material is irritating to the skin and eyes, and is a toxic inhalation hazard. Chlorine is heavier than air and tends to settle in low areas. Chlorine is not flammable, but may support combustion. Hydrofluoric acid is a colorless corrosive liquid. It is a skin, eye, and inhalation hazard. The material is not flammable. Sulfur dioxide is a colorless gas or liquid. It is a skin, eye, and inhalation hazard. The material has a pungent odor. \nWORST-CASE CHLORINE SCENARIO, ERPG 2_ Based on modeling, a complete failure and release of our largest container (2000 pounds) may impact the surrounding area within 1.3 miles.\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE CHLORINE SCENARIO, ERPG 2_ Based on modeling, the most probable release of 10 pounds of chlorine may impact the surrounding area within 0.1 miles.\nWORST-CASE HYDROFLUORIC ACID SCENARIO, ERPG 2_ Based on modeling, the complete failure of our largest container (500 pounds) may impact the surrounding area within 0.3 miles.\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE HYDROFLUORIC ACID SCENARIO, ERPG 2_ Based on modeling, the most probable release of 100 pounds of material may impact the surrounding area within less "

The plant alarm is sounded; 2. Facility Emergency Coordinator is called to assess the release; 3. Fire department HazMat Team is called if needed and facility is evacuated; 4. Richmond County Emergency Management Agency is notified; 5. Release is controlled by the fire department, or plant personnel. We have had no reportable releases in the last five years."
