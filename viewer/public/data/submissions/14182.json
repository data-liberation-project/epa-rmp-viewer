This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our processes.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEquistar's primary activities encompass ethylene oxide and ethylene oxide derivatives manufacturing and polymer and resins manufacturing.  We manufacture or utilize 6 regulated substances at Equistar; ethylene oxide, anhydrous ammonia, propylene, ethylene, propane, and butene.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA using tables and equations has been employed to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class, involves a catastrophic release from the ammonia storage in the amines refining and manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of 430,000 pounds of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 7.3 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 0.14 mg/l.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substan"

The scenario involves the release of 305,000 pounds of propylene.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.5 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release from ethylene oxide storage in the ethylene oxide manufacturing process.  The release is assumed to result from a broken line in the storage area.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 290,000 pounds of ethylene oxide in 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 3.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.09 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from propylene storage in the polypropylene manufacturing process.  The release is assumed to result from a broken line in the storage area.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 50,000 pounds of propylene in 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\n\n\n\n\n4.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis, but at a minimum every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nEquistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed .\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEquistar carries out documented maintenance checks to ensure process equipment is functioning properly.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEquistar conducts audits on a regular basis to verify the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rules are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEquistar investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a catastrophic release of a hazardous material.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.  Investigation reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEquistar believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to"

      "SummaryText": "dings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  A hydrocarbon detection system is planned for installation in and around selected process areas to provide early warning for gas leaks.  This system will allow the facility to promptly detect and respond to gas leaks before they become serious.  Over-blast protection is planned for the Polypropylene Control Room to protect personnel and control equipment in the event of an explosion.  This will provide personnel the opportunity to maintain control of the process in the event of emergency."
