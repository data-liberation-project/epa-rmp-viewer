All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The WSP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the Hays water softening plant facility and to the emergency response services available in the water division, public works,city and community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB). The Water Softening Plant Chlorination Station has been installed to disinfect the water flow into the City of Hays water distribution system. The chlorination system is located on the southeast corner of the main building at 1000 Vine Street Hays, KS The station includes a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment, and an instrument room, which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels, additional safety equipment and a digital atmosphere reading of chlorine in parts per million, that can be read outside the chlorine storage room and in the lab. The amount of chlorine handled is 3 one-ton containers and 25 one hundred fifty pound containers. The chlorine station is checked every two hours by plant operator in a 24 hour day seven days a week and will respond to any trouble alarms which may occur in a matter of minutes.\n\nC). The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\". The first scenario is identified by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".\nEPA's RMP*Comp?"

This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\n\nD). The general DWS accident release prevention program is based on the following key elements: \nHigh level of training of the water division staff .  \nPreventive maintenance program.\nUse of state-of the-art process and safety equipment. \nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of water division staff.\nPerformance of a  hazard review of equipment and procedures and an emergency response plan that is in effect. \n\nE).  This facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated (reviewed) by the City of Hays Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC). This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations. Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed periodically. \nChemical-specific prevention steps include the availability of self contained-breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and presence of chlorine detectors. \n\nF). The water division has updated some of its safety equipment and has reviewed all its programs related to safety. With "
