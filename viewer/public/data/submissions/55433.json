Facility in Archbold, Ohio is a Pizza Manufacturing Facility. The facility incorporates two ammonia refrigeration systems which is a standard Compression and Evaporation Style System, specifics are available through the office of the Safety Manager.\n\nRelease scenarios, both worst case and alternate release, have been developed and specifics are located within other areas of this RMP submittal.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nFrozen Specialties, Inc. had no reportable release within the five years. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify the onsite Engineer and Emergency Response Facilitator. The facilitator takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device. If the facilitator determines that the ammonia level is above 50 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\n\nThe engineer determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed. If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted. The engineers then take appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\n\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral changes have been implemented to improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration systems. The safety relief system and ammonia detection systems have been upgraded. The safety relief system has been upgraded to include ammonia detection in the safety relief header systems.\n\nA construction expansion project at the facility has been completed.
