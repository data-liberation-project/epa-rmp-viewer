      "SummaryText": "Revision 11 Executive Summary\n\n\n\nSacramento Regional CSD (Regional San), has instituted a Risk Management Program (RMP) for\n\nthe Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (SRWTP), as required by Federal Accidental\n\nRelease Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68. The RMP identifies the\n\nequipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with any Regulated\n\nSubstance (RS) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities. The program\n\ndescribes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on\n\nemployees. The program also describes offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the\n\nresults of an offsite consequences analysis, defines a prevention program, emergency response\n\nprogram, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of RS accidental\n\nreleases, and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for auditing of program elements and\n\nimplementation of mitigation measures. The previous RMP 5 year update was filed in April 2014\n\nwith an update submitted in October of 2015 as required by ARP regulations. The program was\n\nedited in June 2017 with the removal and decommissioning of the Sulfur Dioxide covered process.\n\nAn update was submitted in September 2017 to reflect the correction to EPA database deregistration \n\nof all three covered processes when deregistration was requested for the SO2 process. This update is \n\nto reflect the 5 year PHA Study which was completed in December 2018. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe SRWTP treats wastewater collected from the City and County of Sacramento, from the Cities of\n\nFolsom, West Sacramento (Yolo County), Elk Grove, Rancho Cordova, and Citrus Heights. It is\n\nlocated at 8521 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA on 900 acres of a 3,400-acre site between\n\nInterstate 5 and Franklin Blvd., south of Meadowview Rd. The remaining 2,500 acres serve as a\n\nbuffer between the Plant and nearb"

The Plant treats\n\nan average of 145 million gallons (mgd) of wastewater per day. Effective May of 2017, SRWTP transitioned from gaseous sulfur dioxide to liquid sodium bisulfite for de-chlorination. This reduced the SO2 inventory to less than 300 pounds residual in the sulfur dioxide vacuum gas lines (SOV) which will be cleaned and sealed via the SOV Decommissioning Procedure. Effective December 2017, SRWTP transitioned gaseous chlorine to liquid sodium hypochlorite for disinfection. This reduced chlorine inventory to zero pounds and chlorine equipment will be decommissioned via the Chlorine Decommissioning Project. The Plant continues to have methane in quantities greater than the Federal and State threshold quantities.  \n\nSolids removed in the wastewater treatment process are introduced into the anaerobic digesters at\n\nthe Plant. Gas consisting of approximately two-thirds methane is produced in the digesters through\n\nanaerobic digestion. The digester gas is scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide and other\n\ncontaminants, stored in low pressure gas holders, and piped to a cogeneration plant where it is used\n\nto generate electricity and steam. Digester gas that cannot be used by the cogeneration plant is\n\nflared or optionally used as a fuel source for on site boilers. Most methane is consumed shortly after\n\nit is collected; however, the entire potential stored inventory of digester gas in the plant must be\n\nconsidered for the purpose of comparison with the Federal threshold quantity\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSRWTP stores and handles methane in a manner that minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.\n\nTo accomplish this goal, the SRWTP has safety information on methane, the process, and RS eq"

A Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS), an electronic data management system (filenet), and an interim RMP/PSM excel database are used as management tools for the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nMany steps to prevent releases of methane have been identified and implemented since the original\n\nRMP submittal. These include, among other things, use of a Plant Emergency Trip System (PET) to effectively isolate the system during an emergency which limits the amount of RS that may be released from the gas management area. There are also redundant processes and isolation points in the gas management system, and numerous facility-specific operational procedures for the digester gas systems.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving methane at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe SRWTP's Emergency Response Programs applicable to methane have been\n\ncoordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, the local agency\n\nresponsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.\n\nFurthermore, the Gas Management emergency response program was revised in 2012-13 in close\n\ncoordination with Cosumnes Fire and Sacramento City Fire Hazmat Departments. SRWTP recently (June 2018) revalidated an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios and work is in coordination with Cosumnes Fire and Sacramento City Fire to revalidate Gas Management emergency response procedures. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs that have been implemented by the SRWTP are\n\ncategorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, traini"
