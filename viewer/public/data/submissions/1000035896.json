RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results are included in the RMP documentation file.  Population data was obtained using CAPS and public receptor information was obtained using Google Earth as well as facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  Bear Creek is located within the worst case distance to endpoint for denaturant.  \r\n\r\nAlternate Case Scenarios:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia - The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours per day and would be alerted of a relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, model results are included in the onsite RMP documentation file.  Population data was obtained using CAPS and public receptor information was obtained using Google Earth as well as facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  No environmental receptors would be affected by an alternate case release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant) - The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to estimate the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi.  Model results are included under BRUE's RMP documentation file.  Of the entire tanker contents, only a portion was used in the RMP Comp model run to do the breakdown of regulated constituents under Section 112(r).  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff memb"

      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nBig River United Energy, LLC\r\n\r\nBig River United Energy, LLC (BRUE) is submitting this correction based on suggestions from a recent RMP audit conducted at the facility. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nBRUE has an ongoing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and having preventative maintenance programs in place.  BRUE has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety (H&S) Plan, SPCC/FRP, and Emergency Action Plan.  Most of the listed plans have a minimum of annual training requirements in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  Annual training is also a good time to discuss any situations at the facility the occurred over the previous year that the helped the plant gain knowledge on how to better address chemicals or spill practices.  New employees are required to undergo training on the plans listed above prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.  If job duties warrant, new employees may also be required to read through the plans, as well.  BRUE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will follow the applicable procedures outlined in the SPCC/FRP, Industrial SWPPP, and H&S Plans to respond to, contain, clean-up, and properly dispose of the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\nBRUE is located in Dyersville, Delaware County, Iowa.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn.  The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and a flammable mixture"

      "SummaryText": "(natural gasoline), typically referred to a denaturant.  \r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:\r\nWorst Case Scenarios:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia - Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an aboveground steel tank.  The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage tank, creating a toxic vapor cloud.  A determination spreadsheet is included as part of the RMP documentation file at the facility, detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results are also included in the RMP documentation file.  The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to erect a chain link fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes, but the fence would not prevent migration of a release.  Population data was obtained using CAPS and public receptor information was obtained using Google Earth as well as facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  Bear Creek, Tegelar Pond, North Fork Maquoketa River, Plum Creek, Hickory Creek, Silver Creek, Cooksley Creek and Durion Creek are located within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia.  \r\n\r\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant) - The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, otherwise referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature 200 proof ethanol prior to shipment off-site.  Denaturant is stored in an aboveground internal floating roof steel tank within the tank farm.  The tank farm is located within a lined berm with gravel overlay for means of secondary containment.  A worst-case natural gasoline MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability and for RMP Comp modeling.  The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation for the flammable mixture.  The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank,"

      "SummaryText": "er overseeing off-loading if possible.  Therefore, a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment system with underground piping that leads to the tank farm berm.  For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place at BRUE would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  Population data was obtained using CAPS and public receptor information was obtained using Google Earth as well as facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  No environmental receptors would be affected by an alternate case release of denaturant.\r\n\r\nThe BRUE facility qualifies as a Program 3 due the close proximity of public receptors; therefore, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been implemented at the plant.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs in place at the BRUE facility are described in earlier portions of this Executive Summary and in the Industrial SWPPP and SPCC/FRP plans onsite.  As part of training, employees participate in drills and exercises in order to test responsiveness to releases of chemicals onsite.  These drills and exercises are evaluated by BRUE management to determine if any additional training or education is required.  \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nBRUE has not had an accident related to or involving the covered processes in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nBRUE has onsite safety procedures outlined in the facility Health and Safety Plan.  All applicable OSHA standards are followed and safety training is provided to all employees on an annual basis.  Safety training also includes testing to ensure that employees are completing the training modules and to test their retention of the training content.  Emergency response is also addressed in the facility's Industrial SWPPP and SPCC/FRP plans (and annual training)"

      "SummaryText": ".  All Plans listed in this Executive Summary have been prepared in accordance with applicable regulations.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\nBRUE will continue to provide annual training programs to employees covering both safety and environmental programs in place at the facility to ensure the continued safety of employees and contractors.  If any additional training is deemed necessary, BRUE will ensure that additional training or education opportunities are presented to the employees in need.  There are no planned changes to improve safety at the BRUE facility at this time."
