The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\r\nThe Linde Gas North America, LLC facility located in Hammond, Indiana complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane or acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Hammond Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  In addition, each employee is trained monthly on safety policies and procedures.  Employees also participate in Quarterly Safety Committee meetings for the facility.  Hazards identified during the meetings are corrected accordingly.\r\n\r\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\r\nThe Linde Gas facility manufactures and stores acetylene.  Acetylene is put into storage cylinders of various s before they are sold and shipped from the facility.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of chemical acetylene trailers, a medium pressure acetylene generator, and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  \r\n\r\nAcetylene is compressed using chemical acetylene stored on trailers that have acetylene cylinders manifolded together.  The trailers contain approximately 5,785 lbs of acetylene each and are connected to a common manifold.  The piping from the manifold runs underground to the northwest corner of the plant, and then runs above ground to the generator and compressor room.  The supply lines are equipped with pull away protection, flow reducing pressure regulators, 1.2 orifice plates, large flash arrestor, and check valves to protect against reverse flow.\r\n\r\nThe acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  \r\n\r\n3.
