The purpose of this facility is to store, package and blend a wide variety of chemicals for our customers in many different industries.    This new facility will store Epichlorohydrin, which is currently stored at its current facility located in Pasadena, Tx.  Epichlorohydrin is received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 55 gallon steel drums and is not used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility.  Harcros follow safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. We also follow the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) Responsible Distribution standards."
