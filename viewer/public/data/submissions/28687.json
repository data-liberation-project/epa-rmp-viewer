If an accidental release of Ammonia should occur, it is our policy to notify the South Haven Volunteer Fire Dept. or other authorities to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:  This facility is a grain handling facility.  We also resale fertilizer for farm use.  We have a maximum storage of 96,300 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. This total was derived by taking the 85% capacity of one 12,000 gallon storage tank and ten 1,000 gallon nurse tanks multiplied by 5.15#/gal. The number of nurse tanks vary from time to time because we are a multiple location facility.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:  A release of 10000 pounds into the atmosphere over a 10 minute time frame.  The release rate would be 1000 pounds per minute with an estimated distance to endpoint of  0.6 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  This facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule and all state and local codes and regulations.  Our facility is regulated by the Kansas Department of Ag.\n\nFive Year Accident History:  There has been no accidents to report within the last five years involving Anhydrous that caused death or injury to people or property or any environmental damage.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program:  This facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  Further more it is our policy to notify the Sumner County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency."
