The company accidental release prevention program covers design, installation, operations, maintenance and training. \n\nThe facility receives and stores frozen food, cooks food, and packages and freezes food trays for shipment to customers. Anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant, is the only substance regulated by the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration facility is designed and operated in accordance with accepted engineering and industrial codes and standards. Traditions retains information that describes the chemical hazards, operating procedures and equipment design associated with ammonia refrigeration. The company diligently identifies process hazards and controls them efficiently. For instance, Traditions uses written operating procedures for process safety that address several modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. This information is regularly reviewed and made readily accessible to process operators as well as to maintenance and support personnel involved in the ammonia refrigeration process. \n\nTraditions trains employees who will operate the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure they are competent. Refresher training is provided as needed but at least every three years. \n\nThe company documents maintenance inspection of equipment in ammonia service to ensure proper and safe operations. Regularly inspected process equipment includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, process controls and pumps. Only qualified personnel perform maintenance on the ammonia refrigeration system. Furthermore, maintenance personnel are given ammonia safety training. Ammonia refrigeration equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are"

Employees who would be affected by a modification in the ammonia refrigeration system are promptly made aware of the changes. Pre-startup safety reviews will be used to validate construction, process equipment installation, and operation and maintenance procedures prior to placing new or modified equipment into ammonia service. \n\nCompliance Audits are conducted at least every three years and correction measures are undertaken promptly to ensure provisions of the RMP rule and PSM standards are fully implemented.  \n\nTraditions has experienced no reportable ammonia releases within the last 5 years. \n\nThe company conducts process safety management and accident prevention as a team effort. System operation and maintenance employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend process safety and procedural improvements. Additionally, the affected employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule and PSM standard, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nFrom time to time the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction or renovation activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of his safety performance is completed. Traditions informs contractors of potential ammonia and other pertinent hazards related to the contractor's work and the company's processes. Contractors are also informed of procedures that must be followed for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThe emergency response is being coordinated with the Pearl Fire Department and the Rankin County Emergency Planning Committee. \n\nThe are no planned changes to the system at this time.
