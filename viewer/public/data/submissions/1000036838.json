This commitment is demonstrated through implementation of corporate policies and standards. Policies and standards that have been implemented include The Dow Chemical Company's Standards for Safe Work Permitting, Isolation of Energy Sources, Hot Work, Confined Space Entry, Management of Change, Pre-start Up Reviews, and Mechanical Integrity. In addition to these corporate standards, the Harbor Beach facility has implemented facility specific policies to address specific facility situations. Process Hazard Analysis is completed using The Dow Chemical Company's Risk Assessment Tool (RAST), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), and Reactive Chemicals Review process. The facility maintains an incident investigation policy.  This policy requires that all incidents that result in, or could potentially result in a release of a regulated substance, be investigated, documented, and appropriately addressed.\n\n\n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Site operates a chemical manufacturing process that uses fermentation to produce a pesticide active ingredient.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a raw material and processing aid.  The anhydrous ammonia storage tank holds a theoretical maximum inventory of 70,000 pounds; however, administrative and process control limit the content to 80% (56,000 lbs.)                              \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe facility currently complies with EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations. In addition, the facility maintains a Title V Renewable Operating Permit and complies with the Pesticides Active Ingredient Production MACT, 40 CFR 63 Subpart MMM Regulation. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with generally accepted good desig"

All mitigation systems are currently found to be adequate and sufficient to address existing process safety hazards.\n\n\n\nProcedures - The facility maintains written operating procedures. The procedures are periodically reviewed and are readily accessible to all operators involved in the processes. \n\n\n\nTraining - The facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years or more frequently as needed. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits - The facility participates in an EH&S auditing process. Internal EH&S audits are conducted at least once every three years. Topics audited include RMP/PSM (process safety) as well as personal safety, industrial hygiene, and environmental aspects. Corrective actions resulting from an audit are documented and addressed appropriately.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - Site leadership encourages and promotes employees participation. Employee participation includes procedure use, management of change, pre-start up reviews, process hazard analysis, unplanned event investigations and audits as well as site sponsored safety and loss prevention teams. Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. All employees have access to all information pertinent to environmental, safety, and health aspects of the processes they operate. \n\n\n\nContractors - The facility follows the Dow AgroSciences purchasing process in selecting a contractor.

On October 26, 2009, a unplanned 96 pounds of ammonia release occurred. The root cause investigation concluded that the release was due to human error.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan.  The plan includes response to medical incidents, environmental releases, fires, weather emergencies, and utility failures.  Procedures for notification of local emergency response agencies and the community are also included in the plan.  The plan is routinely updated to reflect any changes that would require a modified emergency response.  Site employees receive refresher training annually on the Site plan and participate in emergency drills that include local response agencies.\n\n\n\n"
