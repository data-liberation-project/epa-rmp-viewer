Currently the facility's covered process under the Risk Management Program (RMP) includes the storage and use of iso-pentane and n-pentane.  A correction was submitted on 7/21/09 to revise the population associated with the worst case scenario and to upload the corrected map.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing management, training, procedure, and maintenance systems already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for pentane (includes iso-pentane and n-pentane) in response to the RMP requirement.  The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the facility's RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and standards (OSHA PSM Standard and US EPA 40 CFR 68). \n\n\n\nSource and Federal Regulated Substances Description:\n\nThe Firestone Building Products facility in Bristol, Connecticut, uses a chemical blend of n-pentane and iso-pentane as the blowing agent to produce foam panels to be used as building insulation.  The pentane blend consists of varying amounts of iso-pentane and n-pentane.  Therefore, in order to be conservative, Firestone filed for both 20,000 gallons of n-pentane and 20,000 gallons of iso-pentane even though no more than a maximum of 20,000 gallons total will be on-site at any given time.  The facility includes raw material unloading and storage, material blending operations, panel production and cutting, product storage, and loading operations.  The pentane blend will arrive by truck and will be stored in a 20,000-gallon underground horizontal fixed roof tank.  The tank will be maintained under pressure and will be vented back to the su"

These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequence of any accidental pentane release from the facility and include such measures as process hazards analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-start-up safety, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits.  The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.  \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History: \n\nThe facility has had no RMP reportable accidents or releases of pentane within the preceding five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility's Emergency Response Program has been updated to produce the maximum effective response in the least amount of time.  The facility has coordinated response with the local fire station and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that they will respond to any accidental release from the pentane system.  The facility has also established a notification mechanism to ensure the fire station will be properly notified when any response is needed for a pentane release.  Based on this coordination with the local emergency responders, the facility is not required to implement any additional RMP emergency response program requirements.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  This manager is commi"

Updates to the RMP will be completed as necessary in response to these activities.  \n\n\n\nSUMMARY: \n\nAs documented in this submittal, the RMP for the facility has been completed in accordance with all 40 CFR 68 requirements and the facility has certified compliance.
