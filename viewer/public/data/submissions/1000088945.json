This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\n\n \n\nPlant leaders serve as coaches, encouragers, and examples. Yet, in light of our culture, every person is considered a Safety Leader at home and work. Constant discussion, planning, and training on safety issues will serve to maintain safety awareness and to insure that a high priority is always placed on safety. No job is ever so urgent that safety is jeopardized. Procedures are followed and time is taken to plan the best course of action with the least potential for mishap. As situations and work requirements change, individual safety awareness must grow to accommodate and address these changes.\n\n\n\nLikewise, environmental performance will not be compromised to other priorities. Our people will be leaders in doing the right thing. Team planning, awareness, knowledge, and sharing will be our primary tools for responsible process operations and accurate reporting.\n\n\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be so comfortable with our records and procedures that we become passive. Our goal and attitude will be sustained improvement in keeping safety and environment as priorities. Our people are very capable of working safely, alert to preventing unsafe or environmentally risky situations, and intend to get better as time goes by.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: The site is approximately 11.4 acres, with approximately "

Principle features of the facility include: Batching / Processing Areas, Packaging / Staging Areas, Cold Storage Areas, Mechanical Room / Maintenance, Laboratory and Office Space, Dry Warehouse, Three Raw Milk Receiving Bays. The facility produces pasteurized milk products for its distributors. The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety performance; and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require. Major equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers and other storage vessels, purgers, and a variety of heat exchangers (evaporators, chillers, air handlers, etc.).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\n\nOSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program. \n\nEyewash and safety showers throughout ammonia distribution areas.\n\nClose cooperation with the Fire Department for emergency response training.\n\nTraining Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\n\nPlant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\n\nPlant Safety Award System.\n\nMonthly Safety Meetings.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no reportable releases of ammonia "
