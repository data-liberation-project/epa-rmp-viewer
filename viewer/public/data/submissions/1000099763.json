The on-site emergency response capabilities include full time emergency response teams (described below), fire and spill response equipment, rescue apparatus, ambulance service, and clinic. Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS Site emergency response team members participate in frequent training conducted both internally and externally. In an emergency situation, a member of the plant security staff fulfills the incident commander role. The Incident Commander directs all field response activities and makes regular reports to the management support team as the incident proceeds. The Incident Commander and Incident Team Leaders direct the specific tactical actions of the emergency response teams, described below. Approximately 70 employees who hold full time jobs elsewhere on the site make up the emergency response teams. Most of the employees are cross-trained on more than one team.

A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impacts of chemical hazards. Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur. The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials. The plan is available for public inspection. \r\n\r\nClinton Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups. These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Elanco on community issues.
