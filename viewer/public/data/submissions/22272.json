The maximum quantity released would be130,000 lbs. The distance to the end point\n    is 4.4 miles.\n    The alternate release scenario a 1-in hose is used as an alternate release followed by release of\n    ammonia for 2 min.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 lbs. The distance to the \n    endpoint is .30 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n    The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling\n    of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI)\n    and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111\n    \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused\n   any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been\n   any accidental releases resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage "
