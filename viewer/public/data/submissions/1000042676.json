      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis executive summary briefly describes the elements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Husker Ag LLC. (Husker Ag) ethanol plant located near Plainview, Nebraska.  This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR Part 68.155.  The Husker Ag facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of natural gasoline, a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantities.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nHusker Ag has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nHusker Ag's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the regulated substance.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel are trained to follow the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Description and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nThe Husker Ag is a 75 million gallon per year fuel grade ethanol production plant.   Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through a continuous fermentation and distillation process.\n\nThe regulated substance stored at the facility is natural gasoline, which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product.\n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nHusker Ag has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, process safety management (PSM) requirements from OSHA, and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations.  The facility complies with PSM for the management of ethanol and natural gasoline denaturant.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Pr"

      "SummaryText": "ocess Safety Information\n\nThe facility uses the what-if process hazard analysis (PHA) methodology.  The PHA identified the following potential major hazards:  toxic release, fire, explosion, over pressurization, corrosion, overfilling, equipment failure, and tornadoes.  The facility utilizes process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, grounding equipment, excess flow devices, and remote shut-offs to prevent or limit releases.\n\nHusker Ag keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the plant.  The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\nHusker Ag maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations. The facility has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in facility operations.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employees follow safe work practices and procedures.  The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nHusker Ag conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing pr"

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nHusker Ag has procedures to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance.  Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe facility conducts audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.  The audits include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with plant personnel.\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History:\n\nHusker Ag has not had any accidents reportable under RMP in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Husker Ag ethanol plant maintains a written emergency response plan.  The plan addresses aspects of emergency response, notification of the public and local agencies if a release occurs, and information on emergency health care for exposures.  Husker Ag coordinates response activities with the Plainview Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Husker Ag's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities. The facility has several safety programs in place that incorporate emergency response, in"
