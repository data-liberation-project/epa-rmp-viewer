      "SummaryText": "HALLAM PLANT, HALLAM, NE  68368\n\n1.  Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of the Hallam Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to to mitigate any release to the population and environment of our community.\n\n2.  a.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of fertilizers to farmer  in our area.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at the location is approximately 99,400 pounds, which includes or main storage tank and nurse tanks.  It should be noted that we have 46 nurse tanks, but only 25 are in service.  Anhydrous ammonia is not stored at the Hallam elevator location.  \n\nb.  This RMP facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  The total number for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hours requirement to qualify as a full time employee on site, approxumately 240 man hours per year are spent at this facility, therefore the answer to item number 1.11 is 0 employee.  During periods of non operation of this anhydrous ammonia facility local law enforcement and our personnel conduct inspections a various times of the day and night throughout the year.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour number and appropriate action is taken.\n\nc.  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan, it should be noted that we also handle Propane which is used for heating.  We include Propane in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facility is included in the Risk Management Plan.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the total release  of anhydrous ammonia from our main storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint is approximate"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 24213,
      "SummaryText": "ly  3.3 miles.\n\n4.  Alternative-Case Release Scenario:  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoing would be approximately  0.3 mile.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61\", published by the American National Standards Institure, Inc., and the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\" \n\n6.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  We did have a minor on-site injury on April 22, 1998.\n\n7.  Emergency Response Program.  Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n9.
