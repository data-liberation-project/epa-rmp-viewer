The\nCorporation's CCN boundary encompasses 973 square miles and either surrounds or is adjacent to 16 cities\nand/or communities that operate public water systems. The system presently serves over 31,000 meter\nconnections (representing an estimated population of 124,000), which include households, numerous\nbusinesses, 20 schools and 6 other Public water Systems from 6 surface water treatment plants and 2 reverse\nosmosis (RO) treatment plants. The surface water treatment plants treat surface water conveyed by 6\nirrigation districts. The original source of the raw water is the Rio Grande River.\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident\nPrevention Provisions, requires the development of Risk Management Plans/Programs (RMP) for regulated\nfacilities that store/handle certain substances above a listed threshold quantity. Such facilities must register\nwith the US EPA, list their regulated substances, estimate the off-site consequences of worst-case and\nalternate-case release scenarios, document its applicable prevention measures and coordinate its emergency\nresponses with appropriate local/state authorities.\n\nNAWSC Plant # 5 and Donna RO is a regulated facility under 40 CFR Part 68, because of the presence of\nchlorine gas (Chemical Abstract Services [CAS] No. 7782-50-5) over a regulated threshold quantity of 2,500\npounds. It is also subje"

The OSHA PSM requirements are reflected\nin the Accident Prevention Program Level 3 of the US EPA RMP.\n\nFacility Information: The primary activity at the site is the potable treatment of raw water for sale to retail\nconsumers and other water systems. Its overall treatment capacity is 10.0 million gallons per (MGD). The main\ntreatment processes for Plant #5 consists of: aeration, clarification and filtration. The Donna RO plant is\nadjacent and contiguous to Plant #5 and utilizes the reverse osmosis process to purify raw water. As part of\nconventional purification processes, chlorine is added as a solution in water between the aeration and\nclarification steps and as a gas prior to filtration. As a part of RO purification, chlorine is added as a gas post\nreverse osmosis treatment. Chlorine is stored on-site in: 2 - 150 pound pressurized steel cylinders and 8 - 1\nton pressurized steel containers. The total amount in storage is 16,300 pounds\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario: Not listed in the executive summary for security purposes.\n\nAlternate-Case Release Scenario: Not listed in the executive summary for security purposes.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with\napplicable codes and standards and is developing a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) as required\nby US OSHA. That Program seeks to ensure the safe operation of regulated facilities for all aspects of\nconstruction and operation.\n\nFive Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past 5 years that\nhave caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage, nor to the best of our knowledge, have\nresulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, p"
