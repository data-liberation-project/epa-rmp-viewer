Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Sanderson Farms, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Poultry processing and rendering operation.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous) and Chlorine.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant.  Chlorine is used to generate chlorine dioxide for odor abatement.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine.  In this scenario 4000 lb. or (2) 2000 ton cylinders of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 100% of the maximum capacity of the source by"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 7.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Chlorine.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by sprinkler system(s), excess flow valve(s), flare(s), neutralization and emergency shutdown system(s).   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 2.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia Refrigeration.  The scenario involves the release of 37000 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by sprinkler system(s), excess flow valve(s), flare(s), neutralization and emergency shutdown system(s).   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.99 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSanderson Farms, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conduc"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/08/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Sanderson Farms, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nSanderson Farms, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nSanderson Farms, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Sanderson Farms, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals,"
