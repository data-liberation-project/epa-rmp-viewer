The operators have been properly trained and the facility is on a regular inspection schedule.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n  We have never had an accident involving the release of anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n  This facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.138. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency and training is in place. In the event that an emergency does occur, it is our policy to notify Green Spring VFD and request that they respond.\n\nPlanned Safety Changes:\n  Safety improvement is an on-going process. Periodic evaluations are performed to review the preservation of safe conditions. There are no additional anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations  for implementation at this time."

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n  Owners of Ridge View Farms are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. The facility complies with OSHA 1910.111 standard requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. If an emergency does occur, it is our policy to notify the Green Springs VFD and request that they respond. We are prepared to work with the Green Springs VFD, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release onto people and the environment.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances:\n  This is an owner-operator facility located in a rural setting. The primary function of this facility is the storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia. On site is a 30,000 gallon storage tank containing a maximum capacity of 125,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and associated delivery tank-wagons and application equipment.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:\n  Our worst-case scenario is a failure of the anhydrous ammonia storage, releasing the entire contents within ten minutes. The maimum amount released is 125,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) in this scenario 2.6 miles. Private dwellings with a population of 150 are within the impact endpoint zone.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n  The alternative release scenario is based on a break in a transfer hose from the storage tank to a delivery tank-wagon. In this case, 4,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is released, resulting in a impact endpoint zone of .88 miles. Within this impact zone are private dwellings with a population of 40.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program:\n  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111. \" Storag"
