This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site is located in Westlake, Louisiana. It operates a variety of processes that takes vacuum gas oil (an intermediate product from the refining of raw crude oil) and produces petroleum products such as naptha, kerosene, diesel, and lubricant base oils. The Excel Paralubes site has regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, NFPA4 flammable mixtures, and hydrogen. The site also has several RMP listed toxic substances, but none at the quantity or concentration specified in the regulation.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Excel Paralubes site.

This summary addresses the elements of these requirements and describes the management system in place to address the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in each element of process safety and the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the site. The Plan includes employee work groups and teams with documented action plans to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. Employees are actively involved in the sites formal process safety / risk management audit program and participate as auditors and auditees.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site keeps a variety of technical documents referred to as Process Technology Packages (PTP's). PTP's are used to support safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis / configuration information. Specific departments within the site are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to assist employees in locating process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific inform"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the site has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limit (SOL) section of the PTP. Site operations and maintenance personnel ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe site also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety systems in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site has a comprehensive PHA program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and effectively controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site uses a combination of the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique along with a What-lf checklist to perform these evaluations. In addition, the HAZOP process utilizes a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) which applies industry failure rates to a scenario to calculate a threshold value. The combination of HAZOP /"

The analyses are conducted using a qualified team of personnel who have operating and maintenance experience, process engineering expertise, and experience in the hazard's evaluation technique. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and provides suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team determines such improvements are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive priority attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked thorough completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Excel Paralubes site periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented, forwarded to management for consideration, tracked to resolution, and retained. Metrics are maintained to monitor the timeliness of closure.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) process startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Excel Paralubes site has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in site operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site uses contractors to supplement its workforce for maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, the site evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that change has been properly evaluated and implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Metrics are in place to monitor the timely identification and effective management of deficiencies.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Excel Paralubes site incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site has long-standing safe work practices in place. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (e.g., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This incident history considers on-site/off-site impacts such as injuries and fatalities, on-site/off-site property damage of $500,000 or more, off-site impact such as shelter-in-place or evacuation of the public and off-site environmental damage.  \n\n\n\nSummary:  For the previous five year period of this resubmission, we have had no significant accidental releases.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Excel Paralubes site maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.

In addition, the Excel Paralubes site has procedures that cover maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to site processes or other site facilities.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Excel Paralubes site is coordinated with the Lake Charles, Louisiana Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Excel Paralubes site has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Excel Paralubes site conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the site provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the site.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nMOC/PSSR Improvement Initiative\n\nHeater Safety System Upgrades\n\nElectronic Permitting Process\n\nUpgrades to Emergency Response Atmospheric Monitoring Equipment\n\nSite Safety Initiative - STOP before you START\n\nNew Process Safety Event Tier 3 metrics \n\nDevelopment of Contractor Safety Leadership Courses\n\nAdditional deluge systems for critical equipment\n\nPump Consequence Evaluation Tool (based on process parameters and pump/seal design)\n\nStaff and facilitate PHA / LOPA Corporate Team (drive quality and consistency)\n\nDevelop fit-for-purpose MOC work"
