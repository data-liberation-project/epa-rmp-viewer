Un-merchantable waste wood from Shasta-Trinity and Lassen National Forests, as well as from private lands, are selectively removed and processed in the plant to improve remaining standing timber.  The plant produces over 375 million kWh of electricity per year for sale to a local utility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies\nWheelabrator Shasta facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Injection System used for nitrous oxide reduction.  The facility??A?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nThe anhydrous ammonia is used in oxides of nitrogen oxides (NOx) control.  This process is referred to a \"Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction\" (SNCR).  NOx are generated in the combustion chamber when waste wood is fired.  With the injection of anhydrous ammonia, NOx can be reduced to elemental nitrogen and oxygen.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored onsite in a single above ground tank with a capacity of 12,000 gallons.  The tank is located outdoors.  Facility administrative controls limit the maximum storage capacity to no more than 85% by volume, which is equal to about 57,732 pounds or (10,200 gallons) of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAs part of the RMP, key Prevention Program elements were implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for nitrous oxide reduction.  As ammonia is self alarming due to its pungent odor, even minor releases are readily noticeable.  "
