Since that time, the plant has been idle but increasing gas volumes and other conditions have required that we occasionally restart the plant. Estimated run time for this plant is less than 5 days per calendar year.  In order to accomplish this short amount of run time, a review of the Process Hazards Analysis was conducted and all items found during that review have been corrected.  All personnel operating the facility have been thoroughly trained and are skilled operators from our near by Chipeta Gas Plant.  Across the road from the complex is a field office owned and operated by Anadarko.  All personnel at that office are fully aware of the operations and hazards associated with this facility and complex.  There are no third party receptors within the predicted 1 psi overpressure scenario due to a possible vapor cloud explosion, making this complex a Program Level 1 facility.  Anadarko has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation, minimization of hazardous chemicals stored or used on-site and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes Gas Plant is located approximately 45 miles South of Vernal Utah. The facility includes liquid recovery using a refrigeration system, compression, dehydration, and fractionati"

When operated, the plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream and liquefied hydrocarbons that can be fractionated into propane and Y-grade (which is a mixture of butanes, and pentanes). The liquids that are recovered from the refrigeration process are stored at the plant in pressurized storage tanks until shipped from the plant via truck. The total storage of these pressurized hydrocarbons exceeds 10,000 lbs, making this facility fall under the regulations found in the Risk Management Plan.  Due to the fact there are no third party receptors within the predicted 1.00 psi overpressure radius; this facility is considered a Program Level 1 facility.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  Since the plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic, there are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Natural Buttes facility.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.   The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an emp"

In addition, the PSM program requires that we address process and employee safety issues as part of our normal operations.  Near Miss and Hazard Observation reports are completed by employees with mandatory follow up by management.  Employees also participate in the development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change, safe work practices, and participation in flowsheet reviews. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.   For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant uses the What If/Checklist or HAZOPS method of performing a process hazards analysis (PHA) to evaluate the hazards associated with the process.  These PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The latest PHA was a comprehensive PHA completed in June of 2010.    There are no outstanding issues from either the PHA or the audit left to mitigate.  \n\n\n\nIf necessary the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Natural Buttes gas plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operators understanding of the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, 5) safe and hot work permits as required.  In addition the company has a program in place that evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  No contractor is allowed to perform work at the plant unless they have met the requirements of this evaluation process.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new process or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance mechanism by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, heat exchangers, compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to 1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, 2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change, and 3) ensure that changes do not introduce an unknown hazard to the process.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, or significant environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents it findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection - Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control \n\n- Process relief valves that discharge to a flare which will capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n - Emergency Shutdown Valves - To permit isolation of portions or the entire process\n\n-  Automated shutdown systems that respond to specific process parameters\n\n- Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n- Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n\n- Atmospheric relief devices\n\n- Overall Plant and local area ESDs\n\n- Computer controlled and interlocked processes\n\nRelease Mitigation    \n\n- Manually operated fire extinguishing systems\n\n- Trained emergency response personnel\n\n- Personnel protective equipment \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the last five years (including the time the facility was owned and operated by CIG) there have not been any incidents that did or could have resulted in a catastrophic release as defined by the RMP or PSM standard.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Natural Buttes gas plant is a non-respo"

      "SummaryText": "nding facility. The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. The Natural Buttes Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e. Fire Department). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety-\n\n\n\nAll of the procedures in place at the plant undergo a periodic review to assure that they are consistent with the safety design and operation of the process.  Any changes made to the procedures are documented and communicated to facility employees.\n\n"
