Anhydrous ammonia is the only Process Safety Management and Risk Management Planning regulated substance present at the Multistar Industries, Inc. Othello, Washington facility.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nMultistar Industries, Inc. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program, that covers areas such as the design, installation operating procedures and maintenance, demonstrates this commitment and the employee training associated with our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained personnel are available to mitigate the effects of the incident.  We are also completely coordinated with the Othello and Adams County 5 Fire Departments.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Case Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios were developed using the methodologies provided in the EPA's RMP Comp and Marplot 5.1.1 software programs.  \n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario involves the presumed rupture of the largest storage tank, a stationary railroad tank car containing 160,000 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia, due to a railroad switching accident where an inbound tank car is derailed and punctures the stationary tank car.\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Case Release Scenario involves the presumed failure of a transfer hose during the loading of a truck cargo tank.  The scenario assumes that when the transfer hose fails, the excess flow valve on the stationary railroad tank car temporarily freezes open, resulting in the loss of 2,000 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific "

The Process Hazard Analyses are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at an interval of at least every 5 years.  Any corrective actions noted from the hazard analyses are completed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nMultistar Industries, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.
