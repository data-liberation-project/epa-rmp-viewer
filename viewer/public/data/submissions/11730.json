The plant location does provide a good green belt surrounding the facility that would provide some natural barrier in case of a release. \n\nThe worst case release probability is extremely low based on the safety factors built into the system and the history of operation since 1980 without any significant release.  The worst case release based on modeling, could impact 2.5 miles but the maximum short term exposure limit reached 1,577 yards.  This type release could reach areas of northwestern Greenville, including the airport and surrounding residential neighborhoods with some impact.                                                                                                                  \n\nThe alternate case release, which also has not been experienced in the Plant's history, has a maximum threat zone reaching 87 yards which with prevailing wind speed and direction, is still on the Plant property.                                                                                                                                                              \n\nWith"

A general PSM program was initially presented to the Plant.  With this step, approximately 50% of PSM requirements were met.         Key items included in the program were: written procedures for employee involvement, management of change, incident investigation, pre-startup plus self-audits and forms for use in conjunction with the above procedures. \n                                                                                                                                                                    Next, the PSM program was edited to be site specific.
