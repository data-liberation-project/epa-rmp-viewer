The Choctaw warehouse does not use, manufacture, or process chlorine. This site is used by ALTIVIA for purposes of warehousing and distribution of packaged water treatment chemicals including chlorine. This site is managed and operated by 2 full time employees.\n\nALTIVIA maintains and manages its chlorine inventory on a daily basis. Full chlorine cylinders and containers are received from the ALTIVIA facility in Houston, Texas and stored until needed by customers located in proximity to the Choctaw warehouse. When ALTIVIA drops full chlorine packages at the customer site, empty packages are picked up and returned to the Choctaw warehouse. Empty chlorine packages are returned to ALTIVIA in Houston, TX when ALTIVIA drops off full packages at the Choctaw warehouse.\n\nThe Choctaw facility follows regulations established by DOT, Department of Homeland Security, OSHA, and the EPA that govern the safe handling, storage, and transportation of chlorine cylinders. This facility is subject to the requirements of the EPA RMP program, but is exempt from the requirements of the OSHA PSM program due to its status as a \"retail facility\".\n\nThe Choctaw warehouse has established operating procedures, maintenance programs and performed hazard reviews according to both the RMP rules and industry standard practices; specifically noted practices in Chlorine Institute Pamphlets 1,91 and other publications. These help ALTIVIA minimize the likelyhood of releases.\n\n\nALTIVIA has developed an emergency response plan that details the steps that the Choctaw warehouse will take in the event of a chlorine release, including the roles of internal and external responders. ALTIVIA has developed methods for identifying small releases before they become problematic including multiple inspections of chlorine packaging on a daily basis. This facility has one empl"

ALTIVIA will maintain and train its personnel to provide material and assist responder personnel in the event of a chlorine response.\n\nThis facility has never had any releases or incidents related to chlorine in its operating history.\n\nAs ALTIVIA grows, we are continually looking for new and improved methods to ensure safety of our personnel and our community.  These changes can only occur with continued input and support of our personnel, regulatory agencies, and our community."
