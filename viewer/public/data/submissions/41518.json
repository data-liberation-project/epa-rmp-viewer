      "SummaryText": "A.  The City of Dunedin accidental release prevention policy combines sound operating procedures and management practices.  The policy complies with all pertinent procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The City of Dunedin emergency response policy involves the preparation of site specific response plans, taking into consideration the available emergency response services surrounding each facility.  The emergency response policy is in accordance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.   B.  The City of Dunedin Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is loated at 1401 County Road 1 in the City of Dunedin, Pinellas County, Florida.  The WTP employs reverse osmosis treatment processes to remove dissolved solids and impurities from the water and disinfects it with chlorine.  Disinfection of all public water supplies is necessary to prevent waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery.  The WTP contains a chlorination room which houses three chlorinators and various process piping; an outdoor, open roofed chlorine storage area with up to eight \"ton\" chlorine containers; and assorted safety equipment.  The operations room containing flow and turbidity recorders, various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment is located approximately 200 feet away from the chlorination room. The facility is staffed 24 hours per day, seven days per week.    C.  The offisite consequence analysis takes into consideration two chlorine release scenarios, specified as \"worst-case release\" and \"alternateive scenario\".  The \"worst-case\" is defined by the EPA as the \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance (chlorine gas) from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint\".  The \"alternative scenario\" is defined as the \"more probable\" scenario of a failure, than is the \"worst-canse release\".  The  worst-case release scenario a"

      "SummaryText": "t the Dunedin WTP involves the release of one one-tone cylinder of chlorine outdoors.  The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario is determined based on predefined conditions set by the EPA.  The general conditions are as follows: the release of the entire contents from the cylinder as a gas in 10 minutes, an atmospheric stability class of F, wind speed of 1.5 m/s, ambient temperature of 25 degrees celsius, and a relative humidity of 50 percent.  The conditions surrounding the Dunedin WTP are defined as \"urban\" by the EPA.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is 1.3  miles.  The case study for the alternative release scenario involves the failure of a 5/16 inch gas valve to close.  It is assumed that chlorine detectors alert the WTP operators to the release.  The amount of chlorine released is equal to 2,000 pounds, released at an average rate corresponding to the 5/16 inch hole, which equates to a release rate of 240 lb/min.  The entire contents of the cylinder are released in 8.3 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.3 miles.     D.  The City of Dunedin accidental release prevention program consists of the following elements: (1) The ongoing and continuous training of operators, (2) A preventative maintenance program that follows manufacturer's specifications and acceptable engineering practices, (3) The implementatin of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment, (4) Ongoing equipment and hazard reviews, (5) The use of current operations and maintenance manuals, and (5) Continued equipment inspections.    The City of Dunedin has also included the following chemical specific prevention steps:  (1) The use of chlorine dectectors, (2) The use of self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCUBA), when handling chlorine containers, and (3) All operators have been trained to be aware of the hazardous effects and toxic properties of chlorine.     E.  The Dunedin WTP has experienced no accidental releases of chlorine o"
