There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five year period or in the history of the plant.  \n\nAn RMP/PSM Compliance Manual was initially developed for the site in 2001. Key items included in the manual are:\n\n\u00bfWritten site-specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of       Change, Incident Investigation, Pre Startup Reviews and Self-Audits;\n\n\u00bfChlorine safety information as required by the regulations;\n\n\u00bfStandard Operating Procedures for chlorine management; and\n\n\u00bfChlorine system maintenance procedures.\n\nThe following additional steps were implemented to complete the prevention program:\n\n\u00bfTraining on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation;\n\n\u00bfConducting Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine process at least every 5 years; \n\n\u00bfConducting a Compliance Audit at least every 3 years\n \n\u00bfDeveloping an initial Emergency Response Plan; and \n\n\u00bfTraining in support of the certification of operators.\n          \nThe United Water Project Manager and select employees are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations.  The site's Emergency Response Plans (ERP) is been upgraded in 2006. \n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The SRWTF has an active Employee Safety Committee that is a joint management-employee committee.  The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nAt the Wastewater Plant, there are safety tailgate meetings every 14 days, attended by all employees, to"
