There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five year period or in the history of the plant.  \n\nAn RMP/PSM Compliance Manual was initially developed for the site in 2001. Key items included in the manual are:\n\n?Written site-specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of       Change, Incident Investigation, Pre Startup Reviews and Self-Audits;\n\n?Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations;\n\n?Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management; and\n\n?Chlorine system maintenance procedures.\n\nThe following additional steps were implemented to complete the prevention program:\n\n?Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation;\n\n?Conducting Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine process at least every 5 years; \n\n?Conducting a Compliance Audit at least every 3 years\n \n?Developing an initial Emergency Response Plan; and \n\n?Training in support of the certification of operators.\n          \nThe United Water Project Manager and select employees are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations.  The site's Emergency Response Plans (ERP) is been upgraded in 2006. \n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program.
