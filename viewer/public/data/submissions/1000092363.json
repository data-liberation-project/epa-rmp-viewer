Inlet gas enters the plant from low pressure and high-pressure field gathering stations.  East Vealmoor treats and processes flammable gas and liquid mixtures in an amount greater than the threshold quantify containing any of the following RMP-regulated constituents:\r\n\u00bf\tMethane\r\n\u00bf\tEthane\r\n\u00bf\tPropane\r\n\u00bf\tIsobutane\r\n\u00bf\tButane\r\n\u00bf\tIsopentane\r\n\u00bf\tPentane\r\nThe only RMP-regulated toxic constituent present at East Vealmoor, which is part of the amine treating process and sulfur recovery process, is hydrogen sulfide; however, quantities at this facility are well below the threshold quantity. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nWTG is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for all its employees, contractors, and vendors.  The East Vealmoor Gas Plant has a detailed Emergency Response Plan which all employees are trained on and have readily available in their control room.  WTG conducts drills and coordinates annual mock emergency simulations at the Facility in conjunction with the local responders.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe East Vealmoor process is covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM) regulation.

The PSM elements are implemented to satisfy the PSM/RMP requirements since the East Vealmoor Gas Plant qualifies as a program level 3 RMP process.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nEmployee participation is the foundation block to an evergreen and integrated PSM program.  Thus, the current PSM improvement initiative is heavily focused on this key element as employees are becoming more actively involved in the implementation of each element of PSM.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nComprehensive reviews of the available process safety information (PSI) have been conducted.  Updates to maximum intended inventory (MII) and piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) have been completed.  A comprehensive electronic web-based system utilized for timely access to information has been built, implemented, and made available to all personnel involved with operating the process.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\nA new PHA team including experienced operating personnel (operations and maintenance), WTG engineers, Process Control personnel, safety representatives, and PSM representatives conducted a PHA redo from March 17, 2020 through April 28, 2020.  The final report was published June 23, 2020 and contains an accompanying list of action items.  A tentative completion date for all action items is June 30, 2023; however, this is subject to change.  Results and recommendations from these analyses will be actively shared with employees.  Additionally, a process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented for the interactive tracking of PHA action items to closure.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nWritten operating procedures with references to pertinent PSI are available.

Requirements for the identification, evaluation, control and authorization of modifications to plant design and operations prior to the implementation to ensure that the risk of new or existing hazards are properly managed is available to all personnel.  Extensive PSSR checklists for applicable disciplines (electrical, instrumentation, procedures, etc.) have been developed and implemented.  These checklists are Appendices to the Company's MOC procedure and are available online from the company's electronic web-based process library. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI):\r\nWTG is committed to maintaining the physical integrity of all equipment to prevent failures.  The MI program is being reestablished within WTG to include a MI computerized program that will integrate with the Company's maintenance program to track the code required inspection requirements of all affected equipment and document equipment history accordingly.  This process is being developed in conjunction with the revised comprehensive inspection standards and procedures for all WTG sites.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nWTG investigates all PSM incidents.

Several local emergency responders that support East Vealmoor include the Martin County (Stanton) Fire Department, Howard County Department of Public Safety, and Martin County Department of Public Safety.  The East Vealmoor Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, Police and Sheriff's offices).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  East Vealmoor conducts annual mock emergency drills that involve the Howard County Volunteer Fire Department and emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\nAll incidents that occurred within the previous five years were reviewed to determine whether any are subject to RMP reporting. A primary loss of containment incident occurred on August 13, 2020 when a gas release occurred from inlet compressor Unit 31.  The released gas contacted an ignition source that resulted in a fire.  East Vealmoor operators were able to isolate the gas leak and the fire was extinguished after 1 hour and 44 minutes.  Two inlet compressors, Units 31 and 32, were damaged and have been permanently shut down.  An incident investigation is currently ongoing to determine the exact cause of the release and any contributing factors.  Needed operational or process changes will be determined after completion of the incident investigation report.  The fire resulted in significant onsite property damage, based on preliminary estimates, at the inlet to the gas plant with no operator or contractor injuries.  There were no known offsite impacts.  Additional information about this incident may be submitted once it becomes available.  There have been no other accidental releases of regulated substances meeting the accident reporting criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a) during the prior five years at the East Vealmoor Gas Plant."
