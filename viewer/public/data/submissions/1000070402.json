Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the\n\nfollowing general stages: Liquid storage; Expansion; Evaporation; Compression; and Condensation.\n\nMechanical refrigeration is a physical process, rather than a chemical process: the ammonia\n\nundergoes no chemical changes in the refrigeration cycle. Heat is removed from the product being\n\nrefrigerated or frozen as ammonia changes phase from liquid to vapor. By reliquefying the ammonia\n\nvapor, the ammonia can be used continuously in the refrigeration cycle.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the San Leandro Milk Plant, which is\n\nsubject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard, and the CalARP program).
