As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be, the Kansas Highway Patrol, the Western Plains Medical Complex and Victory Electric.  The Dodge City Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u00b7The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00b7The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u00b7The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\u00b7Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\u00b7An ongoing dialogue with the Ford County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement i"

The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\nNitric acid, sulfuric acid, ammonium polyphosphate and urea ammonium nitrate are stored at the facility.  These substances are not subject to RMP reporting for reasons discussed below.  According to 40 CFR 68.130 Table 1, the 53% nitric acid stored at the facility is in a concentration lower than the minimum necessary to be considered an RMP substance (80%).  Sulfuric acid is stored at the facility; however, it is not a listed RMP substance.  Urea ammonium nitrate and ammonium polyphosphate are mixtures that do not contain RMP-regulated chemicals in concentrations greater than 1%, making these products exempt according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1).  Although these substances are not subject to RMP reporting, the Dodge City Nitrogen Plant handles them in a safe manner.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00b7Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\u00b7Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00b7Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u00b7Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Dodge City Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few"

KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Dodge City Nitrogen Plant is one of several facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the facility, anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) are produced and loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.     \n\nThe ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Dodge City Nitrogen Plant in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane, ethane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantit"

      "SummaryText": "examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of a release of ammonia by having emergency shutdown buttons at the loading areas.\n\u00b7Reducing the severity of fires and providing a means to control vapor cloud formation with fire monitors located throughout the facility.\n\u00b7Reducing the risk of overfilling by having level alarms on storage tanks and bullets.\n\u00b7Requiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading arm is properly disconnected.\n\u00b7Providing an interlock system, which will shutdown ammonia loading pumps upon high pressure during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia due to overpressurization.\n\u00b7Requiring personal protection equipment at all loading areas and SCBA in the control rooms.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Dodge City Nitrogen Plant has had one incident occur during the last five years that is reportable in the five-year accident history maintained under the RMP regulations.  In December 2002, an employee was draining oil from a flash drum.  When ammonia started coming out he accidentally opened the valve instead of closing the valve.  The hose flexed under pressure and ammonia blew into his face.  He was taken to the hospital where he received oxygen and cream for the burn.  As a result of this incident, the hose was replaced with hard pipe to reduce the possibility of a reoccurrence. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate emergency response actions necessary for the Dodge City Ni"
