      "SummaryText": "KIK Georgia (KIK) produces household cleaning products and product bottles at its Hampton Georgia facility.  Its principal product is household bleach.  This Risk Management Plan is submitted for the chlorine that is stored and used at the facility for the production of household bleach (sodium hypochlorite).  Aqueous ammonia is also stored  at the plant, but is present in quantities below the RIsk Management Program rule applicability thresholds, and is therefore not included in this Plan.\n\nChlorine is received at the plant in 90 ton tank cars.  These tank cars are hooked up to the hypochlorite process directly and serve as the storage for chlorine used in the process.  KIK's siding can store up to 6 railcars, but routinely has 2-4 railcars on site at any one time, but only one tank car is in use at any given time.  The siding used for the chlorine tank car storage abuts the hypochlorite processing area, so that all pipe lengths for the chlorine process are relatively short.  An operator is on-hand at all times while chlorine is being used by the process, so response times to any release are within minutes.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for KIK, based on EPA's \"Off-Site Consequnce Guidance\" is based on the improbable release of the contents of an entire 90 ton tank car of chlorine in a ten-minute period.   Based on our analysis of the potential impacts of this scenario, the affected radius of impact for such a release would be 14 miles.  This assessment is based on EPA's RMP*Comp using worst case meteorological assumptions (wind speed 1.5 meters per second, Stability Class F and air temperature of 77F) and an urban topography.\n\nThe alternative scenario for the KIK facility is based on the rupture of a 1\" chlorine transfer hose connected to the chlorine tank car.  It is estimated that the total amount of chlorine released would be 90 tons over a 60 minute period.  The duration of the release is deliberately chosen to be conservative.  The actual total release tim"

This assessment is based on RMP*Comp's alternative scenario meteorological assumptions (wind speed 3 meters per second, Stability Class D and air temperature 77F) and an urban topography.   \n\nIt should be noted that KIK chose to not consider the potential release control that could be provided by the excess flow valves on the chlorine tank car outlets in its alternative release scenario. This choice was based on the fact that the maintenance and quality control of the excess flow valves is not under direct control of KIK, and excess flow valves have some history of failure in the field.\n\nKIK Georgia operates using a Process Safety Management Program for chlorine in accordance with OSHA 1910.119.  As such, the facility maintains training and maintenance programs to provide the maximum in release prevention for this operation.  The hypochlorite production process also uses a hypochlorite batch controller with alarm horns and an emergency shutoff of chlorine flows to prevent over chlorination of a hypochlorite batch.  This controller incorporates a redundant measuring system to ensure that the chlorination operation is well-monitored and controlled.\n\nKIK Georgia has not experienced any accidents with significant on or off-site consequences in the last five years.\n\nKIK Georgia has a written Emergency Response Plan for on-site response to chlorine releases.  This plan has been coordinated with the Henry County Fire Department.  Elements of the plan include procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine release for on-site response, first aid, public notification and evacuation, coordination with the Fire Department, and reporting to the Environmental Protection Division.  Training for the Emergency Response Hazmat Team is conducted annually and drills are conducted quarterly.    \n\nThe KIK Georgia facility is committed to the protection of the health and sa"
