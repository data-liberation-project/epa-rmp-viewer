If any emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Williston Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDescription of this facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility has (2) 30,000 gallons storage tanks in which propane and anhydrous ammonia are stored for delivery to customers.\nThe tanks, piping and all valves are located with a secure fenced area. The delivery trucks and all nurse tanks and propane tanks are also secure.\n\nAccidental release prevention steps taken: The facility is constantly being monitored for any faulty equipment that needs to be repaired or replaced. A training program is given at the beginning of the anhydrous season covering safety when handling anhydrous at all stages. The propane part is monitored and closely watched daily for any changes. This facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and State laws. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ANSI. State law has required that nurse tanks in the area be locked to prevent any illegal use of anhydrous.\n\nFive-year accident history: This facility has had no accidents involving either propane or anhydrous, that have caused deaths, injuries to humans or animals, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane or anhydrous system, it is our policy to notify the Williston Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with Emergency Management Department and the Fire Department"
