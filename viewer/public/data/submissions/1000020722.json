The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the appropriate agencies and potentially affected members of the community.  In addition, it provides procedures for mitigating any releases that may cause harm to the community.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nSince the facility must store 6,000 pounds to maintain a workable inventory of chlorine, it is required to prepare a Risk Management Plan.  To disinfect finished drinking water, the Camden Water Treatment Plant facility uses chlorine, which is considered hazardous by EPA and has a threshold planning quantity of 2,500 pounds under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  The largest chlorine container at the facility is a one ton pressurized container.  The facility is a Program 2 facility due to the fact that there are public receptors within the worst-case scenario distance (eliminating Program 1) and they are not subject to OSHA regulation as a government entity (eliminating Program 3).\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the water system by utilizing the regulated chemical chlorine.  Chlorine is injected into the water system by automatic feeders.  The feed system uses a vacuum demand system which means that with the exception of the gas demand regulator mounted near the gas supply valve on the container, the system is under vacuum.  \n\nA worst-case scenario for this facility is specified in the EPA RMP guidance as the largest container emptying in 10 minutes.  Therefore, this would occur if 2,000 pounds of chlorine were released in 10 minutes or 200 pounds per minute.  Active mitigation has been considered for this scenario in the form of an enclosure.  The chlorine storage tanks are located in the chl"

      "SummaryText": "orine cylinder room, which is constructed of a concrete wall on two sides and two open sides.  It is assumed that the entire contents from the one-ton tank are released as a vapor.  In the years since RMP was implemented, EPA has developed guidance documents and tables of endpoint values that can be used to determine impact areas.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.3 miles for a 200 lb./min release in urban terrain, according to Exhibit F-4 of Appendix F of  the EPA \"GENERAL GUIDANCE ON RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION (40 CFR PART 68)\", published March, 2009.\n\nAn alternative scenario was determined for this facility using knowledge of the system and EPA guidance documents.   The alternative scenario is based on the type of prevention system in place, and the release should be minimal. The vacuum demand system has been determined to be effective in preventing greater than small amounts of chlorine from being released.  The most likely scenario would be the development of a gasket leak between the container gas supply valve and the vacuum demand regulator.    Such a minor leak was equated to a 1/16 inch hole in Exhibit F-12 of Appendix F.   This amount of chlorine vapor release would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.1 of a mile, less than the distance to any public receptors.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Program was developed for the City of Camden and the surrounding areas with the assistance of NRS Consulting Engineers, Inc.  This program has been discussed with the Arkansas Office of Emergency Preparedness and the Camden Fire Department.  A representative of ALTEC Environmental Consultants, LLC visited on February 23, 2011.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Chlorine in the last five years."
