The primary function of this plant is to treat wastewater. In the process of wastewater treatment the District utilizes the use of one regulated toxic substance, chlorine.\n  Chlorine, in the form of a gas and liquid, is received from the manufacture in standard two ton containers. The maximum amount that we will have on site is 28,000 pounds. \n  The District is a safety minded organization, having regular safety meetings, with management reviewing and implementing new safety guidelines as needed.\n  The District used the EPA's RMP*Comp to analyze the regulated toxic substance worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n   Worst case release scenario for chlorine:\nIn this scenario the District assumed a release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine, the release was in an enclosed space with direct contact with outside air. The release was in urban surroundings with the estimated distance affected by this release to be at 1.3 miles. There would be an offsite impact with this release due to a residential population estimated at 6,000 persons with several schools, public parks, and businesses.\n   Alternative release scenario for chlorine:\nIn this scenario the District assumed a release of 1,000 pounds of chlorine, the release was in an enclosed space with direct contact with outside air. The release was in urban surroundings with the estimated distance affected by this release to be at 0.2 miles. There would be an offsite impact with this release due to a residential population estimated at 1,500 persons and a school in the impact area.\n  In the past five years the District has had no accidental releases of chlorine. We believe this is due to our safety program and having experienced and trained personnel. In the event that we would have a accident, we have on site self contained breathing apparatus and drum repair "

The District provides training to its personnel through in house training, vendor provided training, and industry provided training. The District also has a written policy on public notification and on notifying the local emergency responders in case of an accidental release."
