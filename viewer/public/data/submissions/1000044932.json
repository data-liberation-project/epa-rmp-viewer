      "SummaryText": "The Enterprise Products - Pascagoula Gas Plant (\"facility\" or \"refinery\")is located at 6800 Stennis Boulevard; Moss Point, Jackson County, Mississippi 39562.  Enterprise Products purchased this facility from BP and assumed operational control of PGP on June 1, 2016.  The facility receives raw natural gas from deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico, and then separates that gas into its components.  The raw natural gas passing through the plant contains the following regulated substances: methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane.  This natural gas is processed for distribution throughout major pipelines in the Southeast and is provided to customers throughout the Southeast and all along the East Coast.   \r\n \r\nThe facility's risk management program and maximum chemical inventory were evaluated and it was determined that the facility's processes render the facility subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements.  Moreover, the processes render the facility subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR 1910.119.  As such, the terminal is subject to RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains a management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs, and work practices that are related to RMP Prevention Program elements.  These policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, and are designed to further enhance the facility's existing safety programs and procedures.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nEnterprise Products views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.  The Enterprise Products  facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its peopl"

Refer to Section 7 of the RMP submission for a detailed discussion of the facility's OSHA PSM program. \r\n\r\nRMP FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nA release event occurred on June 27, 2016 in a RMP covered process that resulted in significant on-site property damage.  There were no-on site deaths or injuries as a result of this incident.  Enterprise Products is not aware of any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place actions, property damage, or environmental damage that occurred as a result of the June 27, 2016 incident. Enterprise Products notes that the accident history information submitted in connection with this incident is preliminary in that Enterprise Products' investigation into the incident is on-going.  Enterprise Products reserves the right to supplement or modify its accident history submittal and response upon the completion of its investigation.  For additional detail regarding the June 27, 2016 incident, see Section 6 of this registration.  (Updated RMP Accident History information provided on December 16, 2016)\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire and/or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive"

      "SummaryText": "training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which include informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall ERP is coordinated with the Jackson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.   The facility has around-the-clock communication capabilities with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department) to facilitate notification of the public and receive a quick response.  In addition, the facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nTypes of RMP site-specific prevention steps include the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bfRelease detection (e.g., hydrocarbon detectors with alarms);\r\n\u00bfRelease containment and control (e.g., relief valves, isolation valves, automated shutdown systems, redundant equipment and instrumentation, atmospheric relief valves, and cubing or dikes); and\r\n\u00bfRelease mitigation (e.g., fire extinguishing systems, emergency shutdown devices, and trained operations/emergency response personnel).\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe facility resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process to improve safety."
