Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nUnion Carbide Caribe LLC (UCCLLC) Site is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.    Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nUCCLLC Site operates a Chemical Terminal for the distribution and wholesale of Union Carbide products on the Island of Puerto Rico. The Terminal handles approximately 20 million pounds of  chemical products annually.  All products are sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as UCCLLC, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  UCCLLC has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances: Vinyl acetate.\n\n\n3.    Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, are shown immediat"

UCCLLCs general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\nA)    Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThis scenario assumes a catastrophic failure of a vinyl acetate storage tank, releasing 90,000 gallons of vinyl acetate to the surface of a 13,900 square foot , 5 feet high dike. Written operating procedures and a high-level manual monitoring system limit the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank a capacity of 90,000 gallons. According to EPAs Off site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  The following administrative control is used in this analysis: \n7 Quick Response of Local Fire Department: The local fire department can arrive at the site in ten minutes. They have all the necessary equipment to spray foam into the dike wall to limit evaporation \nB)    Alternative Release Scenarios\nFailure of Unloading Hose:  This scenario assumes that an unloading hose fails during a barge unloading of vinyl acetate monomer . Material is spilled at a rate of 500 gpm and stopped by an operator, who is in constant attendance, in 3 minutes.  The total release to water is 18,000 pounds . (1,500 in 3 minutes plus 700 gallon in hose).  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. The following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis: \n7 Emergency Shutdown System:  The barge is provided with a manual emergency pump shutdown system which designed to shut down the pumps and put the transfer valves in a fail-safe position.  This scenario assumes that the Dock Terminal Operator and the barge officer detects the release and actuates the emergency shutdown system 3 minutes after the release occurs.\nOther specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include: \n7 Hyrotesting of Hoses : All transfer hoses are tested annually at 1.5 times the maximum allowa"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nOur general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule and OSHA's PSM standard and implementation of Union Carbide's Operational Safety Program and Episodic Risk Management System.  Key elements include:\nEquipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Process hazard analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\nEpisodic Risk Management:  Periodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards which could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.  These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques.\nOperational Safety Standards:  Design requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in operational safety standards.\nOperating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up-to-date.\nOperator Training/Certification Program:  The Site has a training and testing program which provides operators with the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.\nTechnical Staff Training and Support:  Trained technical staff employees are available to support operations.\nMaintenance Procedures:  The Site has specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely.\nMaintenance Training:  The Site uses trained contr"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at Union Carbide Caribe LLC , Ponce, Puerto Rico Site, that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nUCCLLC maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nUnion Carbide Caribe LLC , maintains constant communication with local emergencies responders . Drills  with local emergency responder that handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies are conducted on a annually basis. Critiques are held on drills and actual events.\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOn-goin"
