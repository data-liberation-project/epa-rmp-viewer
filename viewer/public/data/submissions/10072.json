If an emergency were to occur it is our policy to notify the Oakes City Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility is a fertilizer/propane plant.  We supply propane, fertilizer, NH3, and chemicals to our customers.  Our system consists of 2 propane storage tanks (30,000 and 18,000 gallons) and 2 NH3 storage tanks (30,000 and 12,000).  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of the 30,000 gallon Anhydrous storage when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60F), resulting in a Gas release.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.  The city of Oakes is within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 1800 people.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  The NH3 facility is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with Article 7-12 Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Oakes City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.
