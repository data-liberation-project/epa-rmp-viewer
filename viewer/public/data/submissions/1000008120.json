With regards to safe design, the facility's gaseous chlorine feed system operates on a vacuum injection process, recognized by the American Water Works Association as an inherently safer process than a pressurized gas feed process. Management of the process safety information is detailed, and Agency personnel conduct periodic process hazard analyses and compliance audits.\n     Trained personnel are probably the most important element of the Agency's accidental release prevention program. Even though the Agency experiences a very low turnover rate, general environmental, health, and safety training is conducted on a regular basis at least once every two weeks throughout the year. Employees participate in the identification and development of training topics they feel are essential to the overall objectives of the accidental release prevention program. Topics include the required elements of the accidental release prevention program, operating procedures for the regulated process, chemical-specific bulletins by The Chlorine Institute, and equipment-specific pamphlets by equipment manufacturers. Contractors are evaluated thoroughly and provided appropriate training prior to work, and still then work under the oversight of a Treatment Operator.\n     The other elements of the accidental release prevention program compliment several of the Agency's other environmental, health, and safety programs. Unique elements of the accidental release prevention program include maintenance according to specific procedures to ensure mechanical integrity, management of change procedures, and pre-startup safety review procedures. Existing programs that compliment the accidental release prevention program include the hot work safety program, near-miss and accident/incident investigation reporting program, and emergency planning and response plan.",

THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE:\n     The Board of Directors for South Feather Water & Power Agency recognizes the importance of an effective environmental, health, and safety-compliance program to the well-being of each Agency employee, to the Agency's customers, to the public , to the environment, and to the productivity of Agency operations. Therefore, it is the firm and continuing policy of the Board of Directors that environmental, health & safety compliance and accident prevention shall be considered of primary importance in all phases of the Agency's operation and administration, by all levels of the organization. \n     Within the Agency the General Manager is authorized to approve programs, standards, rules, and procedures to protect and promote the safety and health of Agency employees, customers, the public , the environment, and the productivity of Agency Operations. The Environmental & Safety Manager shall review accidents and compliance issues, and recommend new or revised environmental, health, and/or safety programs, standards, rules, and procedures for approval by the General Manager and implementation within the Agency. The Water Division Manager and Treatment Superintendent shall make environmental, health, and safety compliance an integral part of their regular duties, including the provision of proper training, materials, and equipment so that work can be performed safely and in compliance with regulations and other applicable standards.\n     It is equally the duty of each employee to accept and follow established programs, standards, rules, and procedures, as well as instructions and directives relating to the efficient performance of their work. Every effort will be made to provide adequate training to employees. However, if an employee is ever in doubt about how to do a job safely and correctly, it is their duty to ask a qualified person for assistance. Everyone is responsible for"

Unsafe conditions must be reported.\n     By maintaining an effective environmental, health, and safety compliance program, the risk of personal injury, operational interruptions, and regulatory fines are reduced, and the mission of the Agency is manifested. The cooperation of all Agency employees is required.\n     Consistent with these principles, the Agency is committed to the safe design, administration, and operation of its facilities, and safe work practices of Agency employees and contractors. This includes the AgencyA?s continuing commitment to provide training in accident prevention and emergency response procedures to prevent or minimize the effects of an accidental chemical release. The Agency has and will continue to coordinate with local emergency response personnel in exercises designed to prepare each agency in the appropriate procedures to follow in the event of a chemical release emergency.\n\n(b.) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\n     Since its construction in 1980, the sole purpose of the Agency's Miners Ranch Water Treatment Plant has been to treat raw surface water to safe drinking water standards for distribution to the surrounding community. It is designed and operated as a secure facility with access restricted to a select number of Agency personnel, authorized contractors and vendors, and credentialed representatives of federal, state, and local agencies with designated regulatory authority over Agency operations. \n     The Agency finds beneficial the use of gaseous chlorine as the water treatment disinfectant of choice at the Miners Ranch Water Treatment Plant. Chlorine (Chemical Abstracts Service Number 7782-50-5) is the most widely used disinfectant for treating drinking water in the United States and is typically the least expensive. At the Facility, this chemical is received in and used in the water disinfection process directly from one-ton containers. At any time, "

The properties that make chlorine so effective at water treatment disinfection also make it potentially dangerous if mishandled.\n     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers chlorine a regulated toxic substance and subject to chemical accident prevention regulations when present above the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds. The EPAA?s Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) provisions, as codified in 40 CFR Part 68, require owners or operators of stationary sources with covered processes to conduct a hazard assessment, develop and implement a management system, a prevention program, and an emergency response program to protect the public health and the environment from accidental releases. It also requires these sources to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA. \n     The federal Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) considers chlorine a highly hazardous chemical subject to the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation when present above the threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds. The OSHAA?s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation, codified in 29 CFR 1910.119, requires employers of applicable facilities to prepare and implement a written Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to protect employees in the workplace from catastrophic releases.\n     The California Division of Occupational Safety & Health (DOSH) considers chlorine an acutely hazardous material subject to the Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials regulation when present above the threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds.

Operations Level, including chemical- and facility-specific procedures, and coordination with other emergency response agencies according to the Incident Command System. Safe emergency response procedures include initial investigation and prompt notification to the community emergency dispatch system. Personnel are trained that control of a chemical release is only to be attempted in the incipient stage. Trained personnel with the Butte County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Unit are to respond to an uncontrolled chemical release incident, with Agency staff to provide assistance to incident command outside of the exclusion zone. Due to this reliance, the Agency has and will continue to coordinate with local emergency response personnel in exercises designed to prepare each agency in the most appropriate procedures to follow in the event of a chemical release emergency.\n\n(f.) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n     The Agency considers its environmental, health, and safety compliance programs subject to continuous quality improvement. No significant changes are considered necessary to improve the current safety of the regulated process or operations. However, if future process hazard analyses and/or compliance audits find potential areas that may incrementally increase the safety of the regulated process, these findings will be evaluated, and implemented appropriately."
