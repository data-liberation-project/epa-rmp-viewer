During the past five (5) years, we have not experienced an accidental release from covered processes that has resulted in either deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage offsite.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\tOur emergency response program covers various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  We have written procedures and pre-plans and we conduct training for initial incident response, emergency responder contact, regulatory agency and community notifications, maintenance of emergency response equipment, and specific response management.  Furthermore, we actively participate with the Peoria County Emergency Management Agency (PCEMA) coordinating with the Peoria County EMA community emergency response plan.\n\n\tWe have a trained emergency response team onsite, and we coordinate with Timber Hollis Fire Department, Peoria Fire Department Hazmat Team, and Pekin Fire Department Hazmat Team for handling larger emergency incidents.

The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (0.82 mg/l) is 3.2 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \u0096 Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\tThe worst-case scenario selected is a storage tank rupture that releases the entire contents of 236,500 pounds of anhydrous Dimethylamine (DMA).  DMA is used in the production of amine products at the facility.  This is the largest storage tank of Dimethylamine, and the release is contained within a concrete dike.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and firefighting equipment.  Potential public receptors include the Village of Mapleton residents, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Ingredion employees, Evonik employees, Lanxess employees, Caterpillar Inc. employees, Air Liquide employees, and the general public and commerce within the affected radius.  Assuming the released DMA results in a vapor cloud explosion, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.50 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \u0096 Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nAlternate case scenarios were developed for each regulated toxic chemical.  The individual scenarios are listed below.\n\n\tThe alternative scenario is a 0.5-inch diameter rupture in a 2-inch railcar unloading hose that releases 11,500 pounds of Phosphorus Trichloride (PCl3) for an estimated duration of 40 minutes.  The release is contained within a concrete dike sump.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and firefighting equipment.  Active mitigation is employed.  Potential public receptors include the Village of Mapleton residents, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Ingredion employees, Evonik employees, Lanxess employees, Caterpillar Inc. employees, Air Liquide employees, and the general public and commerc"

      "SummaryText": "han the worst-case release scenario and reach an endpoint offsite unless no such scenario exists.  Release scenarios considered should include, but are not limited to, the following categories:\n1.\tTransfer hose release due to equipment or mechanical failure.\n2.\tProcess piping release due to equipment or mechanical failure.\n3.\tProcess vessel or pump release due to equipment or mechanical failure.\n4.\tVessel overfilling, spills and venting through relief systems.\n5.\tShipping container failures leading to a spill.\n\nSelection of the alternate release scenario is mainly based on the following factors: previous accidents involving the regulated material; release scenario failure rate probability; mitigation system and facility emergency response effect and timeliness; temperature, pressure, and quantities of stored materials; and location of process inventories.  Therefore, based on a review of the five scenario categories listed above, the alternate release scenario that was selected is Transfer hose release due to equipment or mechanical failure.  \n\nThe transfer hose is the weakest link in the unloading process.  Because the shut off valves found on railcars are manually operated, if an unloading hose develops a leak, then a substantial amount of material could be released before response personnel would be able to isolate the vessel.\n\nEPA's MARPLOT and ALOHA were used to determine the residential population within distance to endpoint.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \u0096 Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\tThe worst-case scenario selected is a storage tank rupture that releases the entire contents of 141,200 pounds of Methyl Chloride.  Methyl Chloride is used to produce methyl-based quaternary ammonium compounds at the facility.  This is the only storage tank for Methyl Chloride and the release is contained within a concrete dike.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and firefighting equipment.  Potential public receptors include the Village of Mapleton residents, Hollis P"

      "SummaryText": "At Arxada, we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including: \n- a description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\n- a summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases;\n- an overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n- a five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n- an overview of our emergency response program;\n- and overview of planned changes for continuous safety improvement;\n- the detail information (data elements) about our risk management program.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nOur facility manufactures a variety of specialty organic chemicals from batch processing operations.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics: Methyl Chloride, Phosphorus Trichloride\nFlammables: Dimethylamine (anhydrous), Methylamine (anhydrous)\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKey Off-Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we supply information about worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  An alternate release scenario must be identified for the covered process and regulated material.  The scenario must be more likely to occur t"
