In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics: Methyl Chloride, Phosphorus Trichloride\n\nFlammables: Dimethylamine (anhydrous), Methylamine (anhydrous)\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nKey Off-Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.

Release scenarios considered should include, but are not limited to, the following categories:\n\n1.    Transfer hose release due to equipment or mechanical failure.\n\n2.    Process piping release due to equipment or mechanical failure.\n\n3.    Process vessel or pump release due to equipment or mechanical failure.\n\n4.    Vessel overfilling, spills, and venting through relief systems.\n\n5.    Shipping container failures leading to a spill.\n\n\n\nSelection of the alternate release scenario is mainly based on the following factors: previous accidents involving the regulated material; release scenario failure rate probability; mitigation system and facility emergency response effect and timeliness; temperature, pressure, and quantities of stored materials; and location of process inventories.  Therefore, based on a review of the five scenario categories listed above, the alternate release scenario that was selected is \"Transfer hose release due to equipment or mechanical failure\".  \n\n\n\nThe transfer hose is the weakest link in the unloading process.  Because the shut off valves located on railcars are manually operated, if an unloading hose develops a leak, then a substantial amount of material could be released before response personnel would be able to isolate the vessel.\n\n\n\nEPA's MARPLOT and ALOHA were used to determine the residential population within distance to endpoint.  \n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n    The worst-case scenario selected is a transfer line break that releases 14,420 pounds of Methyl Chloride.  Methyl Chloride is used to produce methyl-based quaternary ammonium compounds at the facility.  This is the only storage tank for Methyl Chloride and the release is contained within a concrete dike.
