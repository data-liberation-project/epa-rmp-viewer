      "SummaryText": "The Behr Process LLC Distribution Center, located at 1995 Standard Avenue Santa Ana, Orange County California (Standard DC) is subject to the State of California Risk Management Plan Program also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, found in the California Code of Regulations Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 (19 CCR \u00a7\u00a7 2735-2785).  The CalARP Program is the Federal Risk Management Plan Program (found at 40 CFR Part 68) with additional state requirements.  \n\nThe CalARP Program regulations requires covered facilities to develop and implement a risk management plan (RMP) that includes, but is not limited to a prevention program that consists of an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, summary of the five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.  The completed RMP is required to be submitted to the California Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) and to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).  Orange County Environmental Health Division is the designated CalARP CUPA for facilities located in Santa Ana, California.\n\nThe Behr facility stores products in aerosol cans that contain flammable propellants listed as regulated substances in Title 19 \u00a7 2770.5, Table 2.  Based on the maximum storage capacity of the aerosol storage cage at the distribution center, the Behr facility exceeds the applicable threshold of 10,000 pounds (lbs) of a flammable regulated substance.  Therefore, the facility is subject to the RMP regulations.  Based on the worst case scenario modeled using RMP*Comp, and the accident history of the facility related to the storage of aerosol can products, the facility is subject to the Program 1 requirements.\n\nThe Behr Distribution Center is a warehouse operation where products in consumer packaging are received, stored and ultimately shipped to various retail locations.  The Behr facility includes aerosol can storage.  Aerosol can"

      "SummaryText": "s are stored in a designated area within the Behr facility that is fully enclosed with fencing and self-closing doors.  The storage area is equipped with racks and an in-rack sprinkler system that provides water at each level of the racks.  The storage area has a capacity of approximately 885,600 aerosol cans.  The aerosol cans are 13 ounces (oz.) by weight, and are stored in boxes of either 6, 12 or 24 cans per box.  \n\nThe aerosol cans contain various spray products.  The products themselves do not contain any RMP toxic or flammable substances; however, the propellants added to the cans include the following RMP-regulated substances: propane, butane and isobutene.  Each can may contain up to 60% by weight of a mixture of these flammable substances. \n\nThe Behr facility meets the Program Level 1 criterion as follows:\n1. The facility has not had a release from the aerosol can storage area in the last five (5) years that reached an off-site receptor.\n2. The distance to the endpoint was calculated using inputs assuming the propellant is a maximum of 60% by weight of the contents of a 13 ounce can. Modeling runs were completed based on a single propellant and a mixture of the three propellants. The results were the same: 0.006 miles, or approximately 32 feet. The nearest public receptor is approximately 60 feet south of the aerosol can storage area.\n3. A copy of the facility's Emergency Business Plan has been provided to the local fire and police departments and local hospital.  Any substantial changes in the plan will be submitted to the Orange County Fire Authority. The facility submits a hazardous material business plan to the Orange County CUPA annually.  Representatives of the Santa Ana Fire Department and Orange County Fire Authority have toured the facility several times."
