Hazard information is provided for each on-site chemical subject to EPCRA-LEPC regulations. \r\n\r\nThe Off-Site Emergency Response Plan described above was developed in a cooperative effort with the Local Emergency Planning Committee for the Emergency Planning District of Berks County to meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 11003.  SA-400 is fully consistent with the Off-Site Emergency Response Plan.  Likewise, the Emergency Response Plan for Employees and On Call Managers is integrated with the Off-Site Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nOntelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. works closely with local response personnel to plan for emergencies.  The Leesport Fire Department and the Berks County Emergency Management Agency have toured the site and trained with Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. personnel.  This is an annual coordination with local agencies.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nThe Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. strives to improve safety by continually evaluating procedures to implement safer practices, as well as having the RMP and PSM plan evaluated by a qualified external auditing party.  Suggestions made by the auditing groups to improve the RMP and PSM program are implemented every three years into the Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC.s' plans and procedures."

If this is not possible, then the management of change procedures ensure that (1) any changes in equipment are consistent with good engineering practice, (2) process safety information is updated accordingly, (3) all operations and maintenance procedures are edited as required, and (4) all affected personnel are notified of the change and receive proper training.\r\n \r\nAdditional controls are provided by a rigorous lockout/tagout program, confined space procedures, hot work procedures, hazardous work permits, fire prevention and control procedures and more.  Employees participate fully in the implementation of the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History \r\n\r\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia System at Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. commenced operations in July 2002.

The Anhydrous Ammonia System has a number of engineering controls to prevent accidental releases.  Multiple, redundant monitors of system temperature, pressure, and flow will automatically notify the control operators before a problem occurs.  Fail-safe interlocks can shut the system down without human intervention.  Multiple ammonia detectors can quickly detect a release and automatically trigger a water deluge system to knock down ammonia vapors.  The facility has been designed for safety, and uses best industry practices for the safe unloading, storage and use of ammonia.   \r\n\r\nIn addition to engineering controls, the program includes a wide array of administrative controls to ensure that the Anhydrous Ammonia System is properly operated and maintained.  As noted above, the administrative controls include written RMP/PSM policies.  The administrative controls also include a detailed analysis of process hazards, written operating procedures, employee training, contractor training, contractor evaluation procedures, management-of-change procedures, regular mechanical integrity inspections and compliance audits.  \r\n\r\nPreventive and corrective maintenance activities on the Anhydrous Ammonia System are planned, scheduled, assigned and documented using a computerized maintenance management information system known as Maximo.

The system works as follows. \r\n\r\nSpecialized tanker trucks bring anhydrous ammonia onsite, where it is transferred to two 1,600 cubic foot (12,000 gallon)  tanks and stored as a pressurized liquid.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the tanks through a sealed system and into a selective catalytic reduction system, where it is injected into the exhaust stream of the facility's combustion turbines.  There, nitrogen oxides in the exhaust react with the ammonia to create harmless nitrogen and water.
