In March 2009, EPA launched RMP*eSubmit, a Web-based system that allows facilities to securely submit and make corrections to their RMPs.

      "SummaryText": "The Lorain Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Plant is located at 520 Hill Creek Drive in Oberlin, Ohio. It processes landfill gas (LFG) from the nearby Republic Lorain County Landfill and converts it to RNG. This is done through a series of processes which include H2S removal, moisture removal, compression, CO2 removal, N2 removal, and O2 removal. \nThe Lorain regulated substances were inventoried against the RMP list. The only chemical that reaches the RMP threshold quantity is methane. For this release scenario, and since the methane is a gas and not liquid, the specific consequence evaluated was Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE). This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is the initial plan for the EDL Lorain Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Plant in Oberlin, Ohio. \nA HSEQ-Emergency Response Plan (ERP), Rev 4/06/2023, has been developed for Lorain. \n(b) Non-responding stationary source. Lorain employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated RMP substances and meet the requirements below: (68.90)\n(1) Lorain does not have regulated toxic substance(s) stored above the threshold quantity, so Lorain is not required to be included in the community emergency response plan. \n(2) Lorain only has regulated flammable substance(s) stored above the threshold quantity and has coordinated response actions with the local fire department. \n(3) Lorain has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. For each subpart in the ERP, Section 3, there are instructions regarding when and how to contact Emergency Services 911. \n(4) Lorain will perform annual emergency response coordination activities; and\n(5) Lorain will perform annual notification exercises. \nPrevention Program, Level 3 - The EDL Lorain facility is subject to Program Level 3 because it is not eligible for Program 1 and is subject to OSHA's PSM standard under federal OSHA programs.  Lorain has written process safety information and PHAs which allow Lorain to identify and understand"
