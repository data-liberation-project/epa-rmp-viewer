Box 306 \nUlen, MN  56585\n\nMCVILLE AGRONOMY PLANT\nFor further information contact Brian Dinger, Site Manager 701-322-4785\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Central Plains Ag Services LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 130,000 lbs in the 30,000 gallon storage tank and nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 lbs.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case release scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  In addition North Dakota Department of Ag rules are followed.\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacu"
