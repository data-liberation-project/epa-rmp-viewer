      "SummaryText": "The City of Statesville management and the Third Creek plant management and staff are committed to the safe and environmentally sound operation of the Third Creek (WWTP ).  In providing wastewater treatment services to the City, the Third Creek plant uses gaseous chlorine in the treatment process to maintain public health and receiving stream quality.  Third Creek has safely operated this process for over 30 years through a comprehensive chlorine safety program including standard operating procedures and continuous training.\n\nThe Third Creek WWTP is a 4.0 million gallon per day (MGD) facility that treats an average of 1.7 MGD.  Incoming wastewater is biologically treated, disinfected using chlorine, and then returned to the receiving stream, Third Creek.  In the disinfection process, wastewater is chlorinated using a chlorinator designed to mix chlorine gas with water to make a chlorine solution.  The treated wastewater is allowed to mix with the chlorine solution in the chlorine contact chamber in an effort to kill pathogens that are harmful to humans, animals, and aquatic life that will be encountered in the receiving stream.  Disinfection of wastewater ensures that public health and receiving stream water quality are preserved.\n\nChlorine is a regulated toxic chemical per 40 CFR Part 68.  Third Creek WWTP stores a maximum of 4, 1-ton cylinders (8000 pounds) and is therefore subject to the RMP requirements.  The Third Creek plant is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nIn order to prevent a chlorine release as outlined in Section 2 and Section 3 of this report, Third Creek WWTP complies with the OSHA PSM standard.  PSM requires that Third Creek's prevention program includes process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permitting, and "

      "SummaryText": "contractor guidelines.  Operational and maintenance standards include all parts of the chlorination injection system.  The facility routinely inspects, tests equipment, and trains employees in the PSM required areas.  The chlorine storage and feeding area is continuously monitored by a  chlorine gas detection monitor and operators thoroughly inspect equipment daily.\n\nThe Third Creek WWTP has not had a chlorine release in the last ten years. Upon notification by the operator on duty, emergency response to an accidental release is handled by the Statesville Fire Department HAZMAT team.  Operators are trained to evacuate upwind and upgrade from the facility in case of a release.  Through coordination with the Iredell County ECOM, all affected surrounding areas would be evacuated."
