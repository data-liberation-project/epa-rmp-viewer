We believe all injuries can be prevented and expect all employees to assume the responsibility for working safely.\n\nAmmonia safety is a key item in the plant safety program.  We take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Risk and Safety Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Laurel Plant produces ice cream and frozen desert products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the products.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Laurel Plant.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\no Employee Participation Program\no Process Safety Information\no Process Hazard Analysis\no Operating Procedures\no Training Program\no Contractor Safety Program\no Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\no Mechanical Integrity Program\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\no Management of Change Procedures\no Incident Investigation Procedures\no Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\nD.

Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Laurel Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  \n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\no Evacuation Plan\no Procedures to Address Serious Accidents\no Ammonia Leak Procedures\no Emergency Medical Procedures\n\nThe program has been coordinated with the Howard County Fire Department.\n\n\nF.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are no current plans to improve safety at the Laurel Plant.  Future changes will be evaluated and implemented as required."
