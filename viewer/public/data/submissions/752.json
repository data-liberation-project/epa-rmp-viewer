New additions to the refrigeration system are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., pipes well above loading docks, tanks placed away from forklift and truck traffic). \n\n2.0  Source and regulated substances handled.\n\n51,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is kept on site at Claxton Poultry Farms, Inc.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold limit of 10,000 lbs. \n\n3.0  Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios.\n\n3.1  Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe horizontal ammonia storage tank north of the Ice Machine House contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a day to day basis.  This tank typically holds approximately 4,663 lbs. of ammonia when 90% full under an internal pressure and temperature of 100 psi and 95 0F.  The Worst Case Scenario assumes that the tank's contents are fully released over a 10-minute period.\n\nThe dispersion models predict, with a wind speed of 3 mph, the release may travel as far as 3.5 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix C).  Approximately 1900 people in the surrounding community reside within the toxic radius.  A list of schools, churches, prisons, etc. are listed in Appendix D. \n\n3.2  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\nThe Alternate Case Scenario was chosen to involve a Krack cooling unit supply line, on the old loading dock, severed by a forklift truck during loading operations.  The 1.5 inch pipeline extends 100 feet from the engine room to the loading dock.  Ammonia (at 37 psi and 0 0F) was estimated to have a flow rate of 135 lbs./min from two-phase (gas/liquid) choked flow equations.  It is estimated that the supply line could be iso"

Approximately 70 people reside within the toxic radius.  The Canoochee River boat launch also lies within the toxic radius.\n\n4.0  Accidental release prevention program.\n\nClaxton Poultry Farms, Inc. standard policy requires daily inspection of the ammonia refrigeration system by trained employees or contracted services personnel in accordance with OSHA and IIAR guidelines.  All necessary repairs are made in a prompt, safe manner.\n   \n5.0  5 year accidental history.\n\nThere has not been a reportable release of ammonia in accordance with EPA/RMP reporting requirements at this facility in the past 5 years from the date of this report.\n\n\n6.0  Emergency response program\n\nEmergency Response:  During normal workday operation, the facility emergency response plan consists of employee notification (alarm) and evacuation, followed by notification of the Claxton Volunteer Fire Department.  Supervisory personnel have received hazardous material technician level training in accordance with OSHA 29CFR 1910.120(q)(iii).  A facility emergency evacuation plan has been prepared and disseminated to facility personnel.  Evacuation routes in case of ammonia release, are noted on the plan.\n\n7.0  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nFuture plans to improve ammonia refrigeration system safety at Claxton Poultry Farms, Inc. include an ammonia detection system and continuing annual operator refresher training and HAZMAT"
