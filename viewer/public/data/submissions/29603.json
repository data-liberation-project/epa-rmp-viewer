All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to. 6th Street Cooler's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  It is also in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe 6th Street Cooler in Holtville is utilized for fresh vegetable cold storage. The facility uses an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to cool the storage areas. The facility uses 22,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration. Anhydrous ammonia is stored at this facility. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios for the process, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release scenario.\"  \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the toxic substance released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by the EPA (0.14 mg/L for anhydrous ammonia), which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\nBoth the worst case release scenario and the alternate release scenario for 6th Street Cooler will go offsite. The offsite consequence analyses for these scenarios were performed for two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely releas"

EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n?    Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of a release point is potentially affected.  This plume, or footprint, is approximately 6% (one-twentieth) of the area of the full circle.\n\n?    It is not appropriate to compare a 10-minute release to a one hour average standard.  The one hour ERPG value can be modified using available time of exposure/concentration relationships to match the ten minute release time.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n?    High level of training of the operators.\n?    Preventative maintenance programs.\n?    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n?    Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n?    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\n6th Street Cooler has reported no accidental releases in the last five years.\n\n6th Street Cooler will fully implement the RMP and will initiate appropriate changes as needed to maintain a safe operation.\n\nThe facility possesses its own emergency response program.  This program includes an Integrated Contingency Plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted once every year; emergency operations and response procedures are also reviewed at that time."
